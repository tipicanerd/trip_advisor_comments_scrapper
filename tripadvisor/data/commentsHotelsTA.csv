Such a great hotel.  Wonderful service.  Friendly  staff.  Ideal location. A block from the main square.  Huge balcony.  Spectacular views. The concierge was so helpful arranging all our excursions and transportation.  Definitely would return.,50,0
"From the lobby, to the the room and then the pool, there is no place in this hotel that is not amazing.  The staff is helpful and very nice.  They go out of their way to make your stay great.  The grounds are lush and lively.",50,0
"Perhaps Loreto's most upscale hotel, with 4 star facilities, located just across the street from the malecon, with full views of the sea of Cortez.  We stayed at the Hotel Oasis, which is a 2/3 star accommodation about 500 yards south but right on the sand, which we preferred to the more upscale accommodation.",50,0
"Pros: We had an absolute lovely time here.  La Mision Hotel is a very nice option when visiting Loreto.  The staff are all very helpful and friendly.   Hotel is very clean.  Beds are wonderful.  Views are magnificent.  There is also a Starbucks in the lobby and they make wonderful coffees. The restaurant is great and if you have a catch, they are more than happy to cook it for you.  The chef made us a delicious ceviche and 3 styles of fish with wonderful dipping sauces, potato mash and veggies.  Rudy, at the front desk was exceptional and always eager to help.  They were all very nice!  Cons: No ice machines in the entire complex.  This was very disappointing.   The rooms do not have a mini fridge.  We were able to get one from Rudy during our stay.  In a hot climate specially, ",40,0
 fridges should be standard in the rooms.  No access to a water machine nor water coolers are available to fill up your own water bottles.  We went to the market and bought our own water bottles.  Towels are a major deal.  We were a family of  3 in our room but they only supplied 2 bath towels a day and not enough face towels or hand towels.,50,0

This is a nice hotel in Loreto with views of the Sea of Cortez.  The staff is very friendly and very accommodating.  Would stay here again.  It is very clean and you can walk to the shopping and restaurants in town.,50,0
"Let me start by saying you will not find a more beautiful,outstanding hotel in Loreto than Hotel La Mision.This was our 2nd time staying here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.From the moment I made our reservation to the day we left we were treated with the upmost respect.We stayed on the third floor ocean view room and it was very nice and clean.I want to thank Angelica Yanez for setting up our champagne and cheese board in our room upon arrival and also all the wonderful staff that went above and beyond to make our stay the very best, there are so many outstanding staff members and I would like to mention a few and thank them for their sincere friendship, Nelson,Edson,Ignacio,Victor,Eduardo Polo,Ivan,Osvaldo,Jesus Mixael,Javier,Eric and Filiberto, you all deserve to be",50,0
 applauded for making us feel at home during our stay.We had a wonderful romantic dinner the night of our anniversary thanks to Angelica for setting everything up for us it was very special and we thank the chef for an outstanding dinner he prepared for us thank you chef Ivan.So if you’re planning a trip to this beautiful town of Loreto don’t hesitate to book your stay at this beautiful hotel right on the malecon overlooking a beautiful ocean you will not regret it.We will definitely return as soon as we can.,40,0

"We had a really great time in las cabañas de Beny who was a really great host ! Beny is very kind and helpful, he gave us some pieces of advice when we arrived and was very friendly !! The cabañas are clean, well-decorated and eco-responsables (some materials are recycled). Plus, you can cook your own food in the kitchen inside the house. It was a wonderful experience ! We really enjoyed it and I would definitly recommand it !",50,1
"Hotel básico pero súper limpio, lo único que el estacionamiento es pequeño pero el lugar es seguro.  Nos quedamos una noche pero satisfechos, sabanas y toallas en excelente estado. Comentaron que inaugurarán alberca en uno o dos meses no recuerdo bien",40,2
"Cute hotel, nice vibe, clean and front desk very attentive. Visited in March 2022 and booked a 2 night stay to relax after a camping trip. The only downside was the pool. It isn’t climatized so on a windy & cold day the water was freezing and they don’t have a hot tub. Tried to cancel 1 night and it wasn’t possible as we’d already payed in full through a site.",20,3
"It is a small boutique hotel with well appointed rooms that are more than comfortable.  The rooms are very clean, the free breakfast offered is more than enough  in this cozy hotel. However in my opinion, what makes this hotel outstanding is the personalized customer service. I found the management very accommodating to all my requests. The location is also very good, close to the beach and the main plaza. I highly recommend this hotel for the casual traveler.",50,3
"The Rosarito Hotel is sweet and clean. The hosts Alejandro and Eduardo were very helpful and kind. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The water is on demand propane so it took me a moment to figure out, but we got it working!  A light made to order Breakfast is served by the pool in their courtyard.  It’s is super safe, as the desk attendant is 24 hours and there are two doors to enter before guest rooms.  It’s walking distance to everything in the town! The Plaza, the historic mission, the bank, the grocery store and very close to the Malecon. I came for a solo birthday trip and the hotel Surprised me With a bottle Of Iced champagne in my Room with bougainvillea flowers  I will come back and enjoyed my stay. Muchas Gracias Rosarito Hotel!!  ",50,3
"Hotel pequeño cerca del malecón y del centro (Iglesia, Palacio Municipal, Museo de las Misiones) cuenta con alberca, habitaciones cómodas, A/C y también incluye el desayuno. La atención por parte del personal es excelente.",50,3
"We came to this hotel on a Saturday night and found a great price and very nice accommodations. Since they don't have private parking, they offered to keep our motorcycle safe on their lobby area. That sealed the deal for us. The place is new, everything in the room smelled new and we had everything we needed. They do have a pool that looks very nice but we were unable to use it due to lack of time. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Loreto.",50,3
This hotel is a very clean small boutique hotel. We were a group of 4 couples and had the hotel all to ourselves. The receptionist was great and helped us during our stay. The rooms are small but not cramped. They have AC and a fan that helped with the summer heat. We had to change rooms from the start because the air conditioner was not working properly. It is located a quick walk to Loreto's main town plaza and all the restaurants nearby. You can also walk to the marina. I would recommend this hotel for a group that wants to stay near the plaza and all it's restaurants. They also offer free breakfast there or at Orlando restaurant a block away. The food was very good.,30,3

"Incredible little gem in Loreto. Wake up to the sunrise outside your door. The bungalows are big as apartments with everything in the kitchen !  I keep coming back here for the location, the cleanliness, the safety and the staff. Gaby at the front desk is just lovely and so helpful !!",50,5
"We stayed here one night in a very cute bungalow that was in a great location across from the Malecon in Loreto.  Gaby, the manager, was very helpful before we even arrived, replying to emails promptly.  She even helped coordinate airline-required Covid testing for us there in the hotel lobby before our departure.  The rooms here are clean and we loved being able to easily walk to restaurants and attractions around Loreto.  We would gladly stay here again!",50,5
"I can't recommend this place highly enough -- literally, everything about it was amazing.  Location -- stunning, right across from the Malecon (and with unrivaled views of the most spectacular sunrises I've ever witnessed).  Grounds...beautiful; every one of the structures has its own lovely outdoor space.  They clean and groom the grounds daily, and are continuing to make even the little improvements at every level.  And Gaby, the wonderful concierge, will go the extra mile to ensure your stay is a memorable one -- when my catamaran tour canceled, she found me a replacement option in literally ten minutes (and don't miss the taco place she and her husband run, Pinche Juan).  Oh, and they will have the COVID test people come to you, and offer a discount, to boot.  Plus they have",50,5
" bikes, which are gratis, and you can store one by your casita (I stayed in the yurt, but I'll be back to stay in the beautiful two bedroom soon).  And they rent by the week, or month, too!    Truly - this was more than a hotel.  It was a home away from home.",50,5

"I spent a wonderful week in Loreto, staying in the lovely back casita at Sukasa Bungalows. The location of the whole property is unbeatable, in a more quiet part of the  malecon, right on the Sea of Cortez. Getting up 40 minutes before sunrise was well worth the effort. I was rewarded with the most spectacular multicolored skies right in front of the property! During the day, I enjoyed laying down on the lounge chairs or reading under the palapa. At mealtime, I was at walking distance from an array of excellent restaurants. I also prepared my own meals in the well equipped kitchen of my casita. If I needed something, I just asked the friendly staff. At night time, the large king size bed was ultra comfortable and the temperature control was easy to operate (ceiling fan with",50,5
" remote, and modern wall AC with remote). The casita was extremely clean and so were the grounds. All the buildings were well taken care of and in excellent condition. The whole place was just charming!",50,5

"Best trip ever! The bungalows are super cute, clean, and had everything we needed for a 1 week vacation. And the staff were extremely nice, over the top helpful and attentive. She helped with dinner and spa reservations as well as set up several excursions for our family of 12. We saw dolphins, fin whale, turtle, caught 8 durados and snorkeling was off the hook! We are definitely going back to SuKasa!",50,5
"A very nice place right in front of the sea. It´s one of the few accommodations in Loreto where the beach is less than 100 m away, so you only have to cross the street and the malecon and you can enjoy the sea and the amazing view.  We got an upgrade to a better room because the air-conditioning in our original room needed maintenance. The fact that this was offered on their initiative and at the same price, shows how much the staff cares about their customers. The staff was extremely nice, the rooms and garden very clean, and it is great that all the rooms have their own place where to sit outdoors and enjoy the nicely decorated garden. Furthermore there is a grill, beach towels and bikes which can be used as well, and free parking in front of the premises. Fast and reliable",50,5
"We spent 2 nights at the Hotel Taselotzin, one of our best experiences in Mexico. The hotel is located a 15-minute walk from the centre of Cuetzalan along very steep roads. Our rooms were simple but attractively decorated. The restaurant serves excellent and very reasonably-priced breakfasts and authentic local dinners. There's a shop selling hand-embroidered items, soaps and other products made by members of the cooperative that runs the hotel – almost a better choice that's available at the Sunday market, plus you can be secure in the knowledge that the items that you're buying really are locally produced and that the profits really go to the producers. Almost all the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.",50,6
"For the money, Mexico has more to offer than any of the many countries I have been fortunate enough to behold. Cuetzalan is absolutely amazing.  It is a trip back in time, complete with cobblestone streets, quaint architecture, an amazing market, and a mountain vibe.  The Hotel Taselotzin is operated by an indigenous women's cooperative.  They offer many articles for sale which they make themselves, including clothing, woven baskets, herbal tinctures, soaps and salves, and more.  The rooms are CLEAN, clean clean.  The embroidered sheets feel like linen.  The towels are so nice.  It was cold when we were there and I had many blankets, so was nice and comfortable.  Wi fi works well in the lobby area. You can expect hot water in the shower.  On top of all that, the service is",50,6
" genuine, friendly, and professional.  They have a small restaurant there, where we took several meals; they were all authentic and served on native-made pottery.  These people and this place contributed immensely to my enjoyment of Cuetzalan.  Beware that it is extremely hilly and steep there, and this hotel is near the top.  We arrived at night and it was pitch dark, so I had no idea what to expect.  My apprehension was abated immediately once I saw the cute lobby and nice, comfortable room.  I felt completely safe there as well.",30,6
…,50,6
"We loved Cuetzalan. The Sunday market is not to be missed. The street food during  the market was excellent. This is a small mountain town, so don’t expect a thriving night life. All the restaurants we visited, we enjoyed. Luna Azul isuare a very good one. The streets are stone and are steep. If you have any mobility issues this may not be the place for you. We wanted to do some off the grid hiking. We went to the tourist office in the square near the church and they called an English speaking guide. The guides name is Jamie Juarez his personal number is 0012331264614. He gave us an excellent off the grid hike. He also offers many other hikes as well. His English is very good and could be a big help in a town that pretty much speaks only Spanish. 3 days was enough in this town,",50,6

"Rooms are clean. Staff are professional. It's a 15-minute walk to the downtown area. Also, they arrange for all sorts of activities around the area like horseback-riding, rappelling, and four-wheeling to waterfalls.",40,6
"This is a beautiful, while simple hotel.  The staff, who belong to an indigenous women's cooperative (great cause), are wonderful people who aim to please. Although the guest rooms do not have TVs, they usually have WiFi (unless you're there during a storm), and they offer a Temaxcal (sweat lodge) and sell handmade clothing and herbal medicines.  They have a restaurant on the premises, as well as a small bar.  They will also arrange for you to go on tours of the local area, including visits to the pyramids, waterfalls, etc. It is a beautiful, relaxing place, which I highly recommend.",50,6
"I really enjoyed my stay here. The rooms were nothing fancy but the beds were comfortable with lots of warm blankets. The shower didn't have tons of water pressure but it was relatively hot. We enjoyed the massages we got and also the meals we had in the restaurant (especially breakfast and the delicious coffee). Although it's a little bit of a hike up and down to the centro (you can also take a combi), it's worth it to be in this peaceful hotel. We did a tour with nearby Descubre Cuetzalan that was also lots of fun.",50,6
"I’ve been fortunate enough to stay in some pretty nice hotels during our 1 month stay in Mexico, but the bed at this hotel would have to be the best so far - so much so, that it would take me a lot of effort to get out of it.  The staff at this hotel are AMAZING - the best service so far that we have received at any hotel! Special mention to Javier who always asked how we were going and if we needed anything, and to Elias who was so extremely helpful with EVERYTHING and always recommending great restaurants for us to go to, Yris and Angel were also super helpful with anything we asked for! The shower pressure is also really good. And the location is really good too - only a 5 mins walk to the main square.  When booking however ask for a room with a view without the tree. Whilst",50,7

This is a wonderful hotel with excellent service and absolutely the perfect location in town. Beach front and around the corner from the village. Quite at night but walk anywhere. Clean as a 5 star hotel should be and the bed is soft view is amazing.,30,7
"The hotel and staff are incredible. So many amenities and everyone works so hard to make sure you are well taken care of. The hotel is in a perfect location, a short walk from the hustle and bustle of the plaza but quiet and feels secluded. The pool and cafe are fantastic and the recent addition of the beach bar is great. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone.",50,7
"Booked a garden room, thinking I would have a nice view. Instead my only window was what looked like construction. I was very disappointed in my view. Tried to get in contact with the manager regarding this. Every day I was told he would call me to make accommodations, yet he never did. Upon checking out, I expressed my dissappointment  that manager never called. Was told he would contact me that day or the next. Still never called. It would be nice if manager would put a little more effort into customer satisfaction. And if you book a garden room, expect to have this view, as I was told that this is their standard view.",30,7
"This Hotel took care of all of our needs Covid tests, travel arrangements and events. The hotel rooms are gorgeous, the service impeccable and they did everything to make our stay enjoyable, comfortable and carefree. We would definitely stay here again Eli is a perfect concierge and Angel all of the staff were perfect.",50,7
We were in town for a wedding. We booked online and the room summary said we would have a garden view. Garden view was misleading to say the least. Service overall was good and the property is nice but see the picture attached,50,7

The check in was super fast and easy ( thank you Iris) We would definitely recommend this hotel who wants to visit Sayulita!!!",50,7
The location is fantastic with breathtaking views over the ocean. The hotel is also walking distance from many restaurants and bars. Our room was a delight. We had plenty of privacy and enjoyed several breakfasts taking in the majestic view from our balcony. Salomon is a superb host. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone!,50,8
"Zoa is a magical place perched atop a beautifully landscaped hillside with unobstructed ocean views &  big open skies. It's a serene spot for whale watching, stargazing, and decompressing. The hotel is secluded yet within walking distance to the beach towns of Mazunte and San Agustinillo.  This is the 2nd time my husband and I have stayed at Zoa in #5. We love the privacy and the surrounding gardens. Our room was always tidy with a fully stocked mini-bar and mezcal. When we weren't commandeering the poolside couches, we lounged on our private terrace enjoying the daily bird activity, sunsets, and distant sounds of music and laughter.  The heated infinity pool is beautiful and there are several different levels where you can relax in a hammock or next to the ocean on some",50,8
" loungers.   Solomon, Paco, chef de cuisine, and everyone at Zoa are what make Zoa truly special and keep us returning. Their hospitality, attentiveness, and easy-going nature add to the chill factor, which is precisely what I crave when escaping daily life. The food at Zoa is some of the best on the Oaxacan coast. And when we wanted to eat elsewhere, Solomon recommended several great restaurants.",50,8

"Stunning hotel, with a beautiful pool set in landscaped gardens on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It’s very well-located, in between two of the nicest beaches in this part of Oaxaca - Mazunte and San Agustinillo. Both are easily walkable (or swimmable, from the tiny little beach at the bottom of the hotel). The hotel is intimate with only a few bedrooms, which are large with beautiful views. The food and service were excellent, and the hotel is well-managed. We would definitely stay here again.",20,8
"Staying at Zoa hotel was a wonderful experience. The rooms have incredible views, the food amazing but it was really about the feeling you get while you are there. It’s hard to describe….They have created a magical space. The manager,Salomon,  and his staff are really incredible. You want for absolutely nothing! You are totally pampered and with only 7 casita’s, you feel like you are at your own private resort. We can’t say enough good things! Thank you to the entire staff for making our holiday so lovely!",50,8
"NO beach access!! Room full of ants. Filthy swimming pool. Our room flooded.  The AC which is above the bed leaks so you are woken up by drops of water on your head… No pressure in the cold water in the shower. The fan in the room was inverted. The air got pulled up instead of blowing air in the room. Sadly, the manager Samuel never made an attempt to apologize or mend anything ( but the leak in the room) I must say that the food and employees are amazing!!",50,8

I actually live in Puerto Vallarta and I love living there so when I travel it must be exceptional and this has ticked all the boxes for me.  Zero complaints!   I love the layout. I love the thoughtful spaces located all throughout the property. I actually like that the beach is next to the property as it encourages you to see the area a bit.

"I had the pleasure of staying here over NYE.  It is located just a half-block off of Hidalgo, the pedestrian walkway through Centro on Calle Abasolo.    The rooms are all kept Immaculately clean with daily maid service.  The towels, while slightly worn, were nice and soft (obviously they use fabric softener in their wash).    The rooms each have a safe ($10 key deposit) and flat screen TV with a few English channels.  Ceiling fans and standing fans are the norm, although a/c is available for an extra $200 Mxn pesos daily (definitely needed during the warmer months, 10 USD per day).    Toilet paper is to be thrown into the bathroom trashcan, as is the norm throughout Latin America.  Plenty of hot water all day and night, but occasionally did have to let it run to get up to the",50,9

After hours of trying we decided to take a bath and go to bed. Oh no! No hot water. It's late by this time so cold shower it is for me. We contact the owner who sends someone out to help. By midnight, we had hot water. The next day, we find out we didn't have the remote to make the Netflix work and after that no problems.

"We traveled in early November 2020, just after several hurricanes had come through and while a tropical storm was making a close pass to the island. We had booked just after Mexico went from COVID Orange (beaches closed) to COVID Yellow (beaches open with social distancing and masks required) so between the storm and COVID, it was an unusual visit. We stayed 9 days and of those, 5 were spent primarily in our room due to rain and wind. So glad we booked with Villa Elena! We had previously communicated with the manager Wilbert via WhatsApp and he picked us up in the property golf cart at the ferry. While the property is very much walking distance to the ferry, with our heavy luggage, the ride was much appreciated. We checked into Suite 4 and everything was as beautiful as it was",50,10
" in the pictures. HUGE room (~600 sqft), modern updated decor, expansive windows overlooking the Caribbean, complete privacy unless there happened to be a boat parked on the Caribbean (unlikely), gorgeous patio with a table and chairs. In the lobby, filtered water is provided for guests which is much appreciated. In the room, a large drip coffee maker, a room sized refrigerator, various dishes and a small hot plate if you want to cook, an extremely comfortable bed, a fun and unusual shower, again overlooking the Caribbean, a sitting area with a foldout couch and two chairs, and plenty of room to spread out luggage without it being in the way. The room also had a Roku TV with Netflix which was a lifesaver for the rainy days and nights that we encountered on this visit. When we went out, Centro/Hildalgo Street was a quick 10 minute walk. We walked both on the street in front of the hotel and on the Malecón next to the ocean and both were accessible and safe. There is a fabulous restaurant (La Lolita) serving authentic Mexican food and drinks less than a block away, and a Farmacia and grocery about three blocks away for stocking up on provisions. All in all, easy to get to everything you needed without being right in the middle of downtown. I can’t say enough wonderful things about the staff, Wilbert and Elisa (the housekeeper). Wilbert was EXTREMELY responsive when we had any sort of issues (odd little things are common anywhere you stay in Mexico) and even gave us a headsup when he was entertaining clients (loud music and tequila! LOL) across the hall in Suite 3. Although we couldn’t hear them, it was amazing that he even thought to notify us. Elisa found an earring that I had lost. They went above and beyond and we could not have been happier with the service. A couple of notes about the room that might be deterrents for other travelers. There are no black out drapes and the room faces east. It didnt bother us but if you are looking for a dark room, this isn’t it. The Caribbean ocean is literally right outside the windows and as such, you hear waves crashing on the shore. I find that infinitely relaxing but again, if you want complete quiet, this is not the place for you. While the room overlooks the Caribbean, there is no “beach” accesible from here—the Caribbean is too rough to swim in. The bathroom situation is “open plan”—that is the shower is open to part of the room and overlooks the ocean, and the toilet has a curtain but no door. Again, this wasn’t an issue for us but might be for others. If I wanted to pick nits, I would LOVE to have lounger chairs on the patio for sunning. I know they are included with Suite 5 and there is plenty of room on the balcony/patio in Suite 4. I made it work but loungers would be great. Otherwise LOVE LOVE LOVE. We will be back!",40,10

Excellent views from rooftop patio.

Building has no outside guest policy which I'm quite sure was sometimes breached by the night owl neighbor in suite 4. Can't be enforced if no owners present.

There was no shower water (only drips), it was quite far on a main road which then backed onto the sea (ie. your sea view is a road first) and management pictures showed the more premium larger rooms only for the booking we made. The bed was not king size as advertised, it was actually a large single bed and we will not be visiting again as it was expensive for what it is.   It was the most expensive hotel of our 2 week trip across Mexico, and by far the worst. I only felt clean once I reached Tulum and had a proper shower with actual water flow.   I would recommend staying near Playa Norte as those",10,11
" hotels were similar priced, but with the associated facilities, location and beach view.",50,11

"We had a lovely stay! Recommend the bigger rooms on one level as opposed to the smaller one with two levels, as we stayed in both. Both are great but the bigger room is the most incredible and also has a balcony with seating and a hammock. Beautifully decorated and clean with an ocean view. The staff are so sweet, lovely and helpful. Highly recommended.",50,11
"Absolutely  amazing customer service and support!!  I'm horrible  with names however the ladies too so good care of me!! I dint want to believe the photos on the site but it's truly that beautiful!  I felt safe and secure,  I could walk into town or take a 5.900 us taxi.  The breakfast  was amazing! I will return again this year without a doubt",10,11
"This is a beautiful place to stay! Fantastic service, clean and comfortable.  Nice modern decor and great rooftop deck and small pool. (Rooftop is best in the evenings. This isn’t an island to waste your time at a pool, the beach is where you want to be!!)The complimentary breakfast brought to your room was also fantastic.  The hotel is located mid island, so be sure to rent a golf cart so you can make the easy, short drive to North Beach, Restaurants and shopping on Hildago Street or around the island to tour and have fun. (BTW you should plan on having a golf cart anyway in Isla. You are completely missing out if you don’t drive around and see what the island has to offer) those that complained about the location obviously didn’t do their research and don’t know the island!!!",10,11
 We’ve been more times to Isla then we can count and enjoyed the location and would highly recommend! ,50,11

"(Long but very informative review - there's a tldr at the bottom). At a time that is difficult enough for hotels and travellers, Icaco has decided it will not only refuse to refund our booking (they offered half of the booking as a credit voucher for use in 2021) but that they will be horrifically rude and unhelpful while doing so. I know what they're going to say, ""it was a non-refundable booking, we offered a voucher"" blah blah blah.  1. I had booked another non-refundable hotel in Cancun, guess what? They closed down until Oct 31 due to public health fears and refunded my money in one week, so don't hide behind a policy written before COVID-19.  2. What are we supposed to do with a 2021 voucher when so much is still up in the air? Will you still be in business? Will there be",50,11
" a second wave or a vaccine then etc?  Now, I can handle hotels saying ""really sorry it's not refundable, it's a difficult time for us but we can offer a voucher"". I'd understand that. It's unprecedented times.  What they did was, after I had cancelled the booking and did not give back $85 in taxes already paid ($535 already paid, with $450 cancellation fee, and another $450 due to be paid at a later date), proceed to be condescending, extremely rude and importantly, then withdraw their previously agreed offer of the voucher in exchange for the $85 back (I've included screenshots as proof).  We didn't ask them to do that, they decided of their own free will to essentially punish us. Ask yourself, should hotels be punishing their guests? Let's imagine what their response will be to this - ""The $85 was for taxes, the mexican govt has already taken it"" So the tax year has ended already? If I return a shirt, I get back taxes on that, don't I? Does that mean if I booked a refundable room, I still wouldn't get taxes back, cause the Mexican Government has it?  But, once again, if they had behaved reasonably and said ""I'm really sorry, there's really nothing we can do"" we could have negotiated amicably. Instead they decided to be petulant, which is bold for a hotel during a pandemic, I'll say that much. Well, that's my review. Hope you enjoyed.",50,11
"The staff was replying to my questions in a timely manner. The Booking was easy and the hostel is pretty close to the Ferry station when you come over from Cancun. Although, it was a bit difficult finding them at first glance because you have to walk up the stairs from the main street, so do not get stressed not finding them first- you will! :) (I could not see the entrance on Google as the main entrance is just between 2 streets not recognized by Google map) Check it was okay, paid upon arrival and I was shown to my dormitory. Expect to leave a 100 pesos deposit for any loss or damage. My dormitory was without AC, but I was okay since I get sick from AC disregarding the humidity.   - I was staying in a bed above and there was no curtain. That was one of my pain points since I",40,12
" do stay in hostels quite often and that is something important for me. - There was no separate locker but we could place our bags underneath the bed. Take your own locker to close your stuff because there is a hook on your locker door.   - My linen was clean and the separate shared dormitory bathroom was acceptable, although the bathtub was clocked a few times and ended up standing in the water.  - We had a small terrace area as well to hang our towels out. -Internet speed is fine, I could do my work well.  -Breakfast: Toast, Eggs, Fruits, Jam, Butter, Coffee (Usual stuff in Mexican hostels for a breakfast) - If you do drink your coffee with milk, get one from a grocery store because sometimes they do not have milk (The coffee is pretty weak anyway) - Common areas were cleaned. You can smoke there. Plugs can be found next to your bed and in the common areas as well next to the tables. - I did not use the swimming pool although they have one.  My absolute fav was the rooftop, where you can drink at the evening. Also great place for early birds to do your yoga or just sit and watch the sunrise from one side or look at the other side where you have a great view of Cancun.  I stayed a few nights and the hostel itself was a cool experience. No one wears masks but you are outside/open air in the common areas anyways. Not really sure how to rate the service because I get what I paid for.",20,12

Their dormitory rooms also looked nice and spacious although we didn’t stay in them. A nice breakfast of eggs, fresh fruit, coffee, and toast is included with your stay. They also have fabulous cocktails and really great food that are super reasonably priced... check out their all you can eat pizza on Monday/Friday nights!

"Stayed here for 6 days with my partner in a private room with a fan and aircon. No concerns about the room, it was very large and cleaned daily.  Very much hostel vibes in the evening but during the day quiet as everyone goes to the beach together.  The staff were very helpful and accommodating. They tried to include you in activities. Some of the activities included pizza parties, DJ, magician, nights out as well as daily trips to the beach.  Beautiful 360 degree  view from the roof which I have included in the post.  I would highly recommend to stay here on the island. ",50,12

Thank you so much Lili for everything for sure we will come back.",50,13
"We needed to escape the diesel filled streets of downtown Isla Mujeres, so we headed to the end of the island to find a quiet get away and stumbled upon Marias Kankin, Lilly greeted us with a welcome and a smile. We were not guest's at Marias, but enjoyed relaxing on the two lounge chairs within the restaurant area by the pool and had a wonderful time relaxing and enjoyed food and drink. After we relaxed Lilly showed us rooms 9 & 10, both very beautiful, we will be back to stay!!!",40,13
"We’ve been coming to this restaurant for years, and always thought it was one of the best places to eat on the island and is a great setting on the water However, we all felt that this meal was almost inedible and really overpriced. Although the salad was fresh and the drinks were great, the fish was dry and the vegetables and French fries were so greasy we couldn’t eat them. The shrimp cocktail was priced at $20 US. Based on the photo in the menu we thought it would be worth it but there were almost no shrimp it in it. This ended up being one of our most expensive and only disappointing meal we had on the trip. We won’t be back.",20,13
"It is the right choice for visitors looking for a combination of charm, peace and tranquility, and a convenient position from which to explore Isla Mujeres. It is a small and comfortable hotel. It offers an attentive and personalized service and is always available to offer assistance to guests.  There is also a splendid terrace where, from the morning onwards, you can relax and immerse yourself in the atmosphere, watching the beach traveling through the water and the people.  highly recommended!",50,13
"Our family really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you Ana as well!  So quiet w/ own clean beach where you can snorkel (even cat sharks and we saw a sting ray as well), canoe and paddle board for free. Restaurant accompnied with sunrise and sunset is a true priviledge.   For the management:  Continental breakfast is very limited to toasts, one glass of orange juice and coffee. Nothing for kids as well. And it takes more than 45min from kitchen to fry some eggs or bring two spoons of yogurt. Dinner is prepared with more speed than breakfast?   Rooms were a bit out of shape and needs improvement. Fortunately we got another room and hot water.   Wifi is lagging all the time, so do not work just relax...

"There are  many things to like about Marian's Kan Kin. The property is beautiful with a private beach and dock. It's quiet and peaceful. The rooms are basic but quite comfortable with great air conditioning. You get two bottles of water in a mini fridge each day which was helpful. Yes, the bedding is simple, but I was impressed that when I had obviously used a cushion from the couch as an extra pillow for reading in bed, the next morning two extra bed pillows were there without my asking. The wif-fi is spotty at best. The pictures of the rooms and property are accurate. The property is very small and rustic, and the beach really is private. I liked the little pool with its view out to the ocean. Unfortunately, and obviously not the fault of the hotel, the water was too rough and",20,13
" stirred up for us to do any snorkeling or much swimming off the beach the week we were there. They have free kayaks and paddle boards, but we couldn't take advantage of them. Maria's Kan Kin is a little difficult to have as a base for a vacation, however. It's too far to walk to any place other than the Kin Ha restaurant. The front desk tries but is somewhat limited in their ability to help with some things, partly because there wasn't always someone there who could speak English and our rudimentary Spanish wasn't quite enough. (A suggestion would be to have a map and a FAQ page printed out for English speakers to read no matter who is in the office.) That and the spotty wif-fi made it difficult to plan our activities or look for restaurants or places to go. They were, however, always able to call us a cab. The restaurant is pretty basic. It's got a fabulous view, but it is outside and we couldn't take the mosquitoes after a while. Bring bug spray! And the continental breakfast that comes with the room really isn't a continental breakfast. It's simply toast and jam, extremely strong coffee, and orange juice. Again, a suggestion for the hotel is simply to make this clear, ""Coffee and toast offered in the morning along with an al la carte menu."" There is a breakfast menu you can order from (but not before 8:30!). Maria's Kan Kin is a definite consideration if you wish to stay away from the crowds of North Beach, just know that it's not a luxury stay and will involve a bit of extra effort.",10,13

Amplia habitación con baño y cocineta, mesa para desayunar, etc. La alberca pequeña pero limpiecita, el jardín precioso. Todo se ve nuevo y limpio. Sisal está en una zona de manglares muy grande ya que empieza en Celestún y termina en Chuburna.

No air-conditioning (though two big fans - if you work them correctly, you’ll be fine even in heat) but you can take a dip in the pool. The outdoor areas will stay cool due to the foliage. It is also on the sleepy side of the island which we liked, but means you have to take transportation to most areas. There are restaurants in the vicinity, though none of them great.

The best way to get around the island is to rent a golf cart and all the rental places are at the other end of the island so you can get a taxi to the downtown.  In islas Mujeres you can find all kind of restaurants and can tell you they are all really good and the seafood is to die for.

Pictures below of the tent lock provided were unacceptable. It offered no protection and the zipper was fully available for  anyone to open. It would also be easy for a stranger to cut through the canvas lining of the tent. I did not hear anything about security guards at night or during the day,  but I  was told there were outside cameras ( I could not see them when they were pointed out to me). I was not given any details on how many camera",10,17
" there were or what locations the cameras  were placed to ensure max protection. I was also not given a security number to call  for help if I thought my tent had been broken into at night. The linens were dirty with yellow stains and the bed was rock hard. The white tent was also stained with green and yellow  mold, which I am in fact allergic to. The shower didn’t look very clean and I would have not entered it without wearing my sandals.  I also didn’t feel safe leaving my suitcase or personal belongings in the tent during the day or coming back to the tent alone due to lack of security (or security that I knew of).  I went back out to the front to speak with the office manager Lupita, and she was one where to be found. I waited for over 10-15 minutes to talk to her about the situation with my tent, but  she and  other staff members were nowhere to be found.Lupita  was very nice and accommodating at first, but was not available when I needed to speak with her about the tent conditions and safety concerns. The  pictures online at airbnb  are deceiving and the place is not that nice, safe, clean, serene, or relaxing. It was a very uncomfortable situation and I felt scared that I couldn’t find someone to talk to me, even in the daytime .What if that was at night and I was in danger? The main concern is the non- exist safety or security with securely looking at the tents.Also the tents, are covered in mold, the linens looked soiled, the however bottom did not look clean, the pool was green/yellow color (not clear and shown in the pictures), and staff was very difficult to locate.

As of right now, It looks like the charge was refunded for a second night of $117.74 for a night that I did not commit too.

We tried to ask for a new room, because of cause we didn’t want that, and I’m pregnant so I truly don’t want do sleep with mosquito spray on. The didn’t had another room, so actually after 20 min check in, we wanted to check out because this was not acceptable at all! We asked for fully refund, because we didn’t wanted to stay and didn’t even stay for more than 20 min, but the owner almost laughed at us and told we shouldn’t come to Mexico if we were afraid of mosquitos!!! He told us we could put our clothes to",50,19
"We started out in a Penthouse suite with a roof top Terrance.  The room was immaculate and we loved it, you could see the ocean from the roof top.  The beds are nice and there was good wifi and Hulu in the rooms.  The kitchen was fully stocked and even a bonus bottle of tequila left.  This was good since it was Sunday when we arrived and the stores don't sell alcohol on Sundays.  The only issue was the stove top did not work. The front desk said a technician would be there the next day and sort it out.  He never showed so the next day the front desk moved us into a townhome in the same complex.  This place was amazing!.  There was a upstairs master with bath that opened up to a patio.  The lower level had a large kitchen and dining area with beautiful tile and stone accents. ",50,20
" Stone stairs leading upstairs and a separate apartment at the front door for our guests.  The separate apartment had a sink, fridge and bonus outdoor shower on the patio.  Pretty cool. Loved both rooms we got to live in and the grounds are awesome.  Flowers everywhere, two nice pools with seating and a bar top in one of them.  You get access to the GBP resorts and for a small $15 per person you can have food at one of the snack bars.  No snacking here full bar salad bar and many choices to eat.  We stayed for about three hours right on the beach and there was no trying to hurry us out.  The wait staff was right on top of drinks and cleaning plates.  We had a great time and can't wait to return.",50,20
…,50,20
"My family with 2 kids stayed here in August and the place was awesome. The entrance was beautiful, one of the nicest place I’ve stayed in. The pricing was very reasonable and will definitely stay here again. Make sure you ask for directions at gate because there’s about 6 different complexes and we had a hard time finding it. There’s no beach here but you have acces to the beach across the street at Bahia Principe Tulum where “salesmen” will try to sell you a timeshare and harass people throughout your visit at the lobby and pool. Please be aware you are not required to speak to them (nothing is free). Enjoy your vacation you did not spend money to go waste time at a presentation.",40,20
"This airbnb has two amazing and big pools, a really good Thai restaurant called Curry. All the staff was super nice and helpful, specially those guys at the front desk. Would stay here again without a doubt.",40,21
"Do not stay here! Terrible customer service! There is no onsite front desk person! They lost my ID and refused to give me a refund for it. They also do not respond when you make a compliant! The hotel is located in an under construction area, where no excursion shuttles will pick you up. There is only one restaurant that will only serve you lunch and dinner. The pool is also very dirty and does not get cleaned!",10,21
This place is unbelievable dishonest. They make book with a great price but don’t tell you that a 3 bedroom apartment with 5 beds is only for 2 people!!!!! Once you get there you have to pay $50 per each guest extra a night!!! The manager lives in Germany!!! No one to speak with! Only a lady at the front desk disrespectful didn’t care about anything 0 customer se one and super rude!!!! We decided to cancel our reservation (never check in) they never refund us!!! Took $400 from us without even staying in their property! Worst experience I ever had in Mexico and any country in my life! we booked this vi Expedia and they didn’t care as well we never got refund a dollar of it!!,10,21
"Worst hotel experience ever! On our last day of our stay, we got robbed in this hotel. Staff members stole a big amount of cash from our room just like that. When we asked for help, no one cared at all. There was no help provided what so ever. Watch out and don’t get fooled! Lock and hide everything, these people have no morals!",10,21
"We stay at Central Park for 8 days and it was absolutely horrible experience! On out last day, the stuff stole our money, while we were at the reception.  When we reached out for help, nobody could solve anything and they refused us to check the cameras. The only person who was trying to help was Enrique, the receptionist.  We were not the only people that got robbed at this place.  Do NOT Book this hotel! It is NOT secured at all!!!",10,21
"This place is not like a hotel, more like apartments so don't expect a huge lobby/reception. Staff were friendly and pleasant to deal with. We stayed in one of the penthouses which was just beautiful, everything was ultra modern and new. The bed was super comfortable, many smart TVs to watch Netflix, the rooftop was nice to relax at. We didn't use the pool/spa/restaurant/gym (rock climbing wall) but they seem like good facilities and are there if you want them. We visited the Los Amigos Beach Club which was handy to have an area with free day beds and beach facilities, they even give you beach towels there (you don't have to spend money, we drove ourselves though). The food and drinks were expensive compared to places in downtown Tulum but it was still good food.",50,21
"Traveled here for a friends 40th birthday trip with a large group of people. Everything seemed fine at first, but started to notice certain things, such as not enough staff or security, not being allowed more than one key per room, the air conditioning units malfunctioning, and finally people's items going missing. While a majority of the staff was helpful and accommodating I don't think I'll be returning to Central Park after the previous experiences there.",10,21
"Forget about room service, how about robbed service? We had a group of about 45 people and booked 5 of the penthouses among a bunch of rooms. The service was terrible and several of us were robbed of our belongings including: IDs, credit cards, a laptop and a ton of cash. Then they tried to fine us for having glass in the pool, which is funny cause the waiters handed us glasses while we were in the pool... This place is terrible and I highly recommend you book elsewhere, the staff is very unfriendly. We leave be México, but this place is a mistake to stay in.",10,21
"The guys who set this place up are developers and it shows. It LOOKS gorgeous. But... scratch the surface and it has zero substance. The service is basically non existent, like a serviced apartment at best, where you have to chase everything you ask for. We arrived 40 minutes ahead of check in. Room not ready so we got some food-300 pesos for 3 fish tacos (?!) then they said they would come get us when it was ready. They didn’t. 20 minutes after check in we asked... they said oh yes it’s ready. Took us to our room. We had to ask them to bring our luggage. (?!) They ran out of towels-even at the gym-where the reception is super frosty too-not even a hello when you walk in. We had no towels at all for part of our stay. And our bed was broken-as in, slats popped out when we lay",30,21
" down, and we had to sleep sideways to avoid the hole this made. We told the staff when we left and they didn’t seem at all surprised, didn’t apologise, just said thanks for telling us. The things they offer in the inroom guide they don’t back up in real life. For example... everyone can’t use the bikes for free. They have no snorkels to borrow. They tried to rip us off overcharging 1000 pesos for a tour-we booked in town instead. Lovely facade, lovely pools, location was good (we enjoyed the walk to town and only 50 pesos to get a taxi...) but the lovely mattress and linen didn’t make up for no towels and the damn bed being broke! My usual rule is if you have nothing nice to say say nothing at all, but here I think you should be forewarned if you want something other than instagramable pics, stay elsewhere. ",10,21
"We spent 5 days at Ma’xanab, and it was unbelievable. The attention to detail and focus on your comfort during the stay exceeded all expectations.  The design of the hotel welcomed you from the hot and humid jungle into the fresh breezy beach side. Patricio at the concierge desk was excellent at making sure all bookings and preparation was catered to in advance of our arrival. Jose down at the restaurant ensured we had everything we needed and would take the time to explain to us the rich culture of this Mayan territory. Honestly Jose made the trip for us.  The beach club was chilled with music and set back cabanas and a stunning pool.  The room was perfect too, beach side balcony and private pool outdoor shower complete with a modern Mexican boho interior vibe. This hotel is",50,22
" literally paradise, leaving was probably the hardest thing we did!",50,22
…,50,22
"I wish we could give this place more than five stars. The room is stunning, amazing views, beautiful decor and great size. I was concerned that the plunge pool would be a bit of a gimmick but actually it was amazing and we used it multiple times a day to cool off or chill out.   The beach club is brilliant with a bed for every room and loads of space and great house music playing.   The best thing though is the staff who were so warm and friendly that they made us feel completely at home. No request was too much and they were so attentive. We found service in Tulum to generally be a bit mixed, but at maxanab it was perfect every time.",50,22
"Recently stayed at the Maxanab hotel and do not have enough great things to say about it. Their staff was attentive, no request was ever too much and everyone was so friendly. We stayed at the property for 4 nights. Rooms were clean, food and drinks were delicious and when asking for recommendations for activities or restaurants we were always provided with plenty of fantastic options. I highly recommend this hotel and supporting the wonderful staff who make it run smoothly.",50,22
"A unique and very relaxing place to visit, Roberto at the beach club was amazing, kind and professional.   Fabiola from Front Desk gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an overview of the place, she is very kind and attentive!!  Food and drinks are great, as well as the music and ambience.   Amenities and facilities are top !!!!  Thank you everyone at Ma’Xanab Hotel, we had a great time !!!!",30,22
"We had a really amazing stay at Hotel Ma'xanab Tulum. Prior to our 3 nights here, we'd stayed at a nearby resort that was 40% more expensive and in the end we preferred the Ma'xanab.  I prefer a room with more natural light than the hut-style offers, but the room was nice. We especially loved the plunge pool on the balcony. It conveniently heated up to a warmer temp when the sunset daily which was a perfect and relaxing way to transition from beach time to dinner time.  I can't say enough about the staff. From Adan who checked us in and assisted us at the front desk throughout our stay to Jose and Roberto at the restaurant and beach club - they were all amazing. So friendly, fun, helpful and at the same time laid back.  The restaurant and beach club was the perfect speed for us.",50,22
" Strong cocktails, music (not silence but also not a full on loud DJ scene), AMAZING pool, delicious food and again, amazing staff.  We will definitely be back to Hotel Ma'xanab and appreciate all of the wonderful people that made our stay so great!",20,22
…,50,22
"Location is great, short walk from all the great bars, staff is friendly, you get a bracelet as the key to your room which is cool, the hotel feels new and looks very nice. Breakfast was nice. On the down side: had stains on my pillow case and the sheet that covered the mattress was torn and had a hole in it, asked for it to be replaced but it wasn't done... the private pool felt a bit dirty after a one day use, no circulation in the water... overall I won't return and don't really recommend, no value for money.",50,22
"I've never stayed at a place with such a personal touch! I'm no camper or glamper but I will definitely come back to Casa Nawal. One of the main reasons, other than the fact that you're glamping in an air conditioned tent next to the ocean (hello), was the level of service and attentiveness.  Thought not crazy, I did reach out to make multiple requests and Peace was always quick to respond to make sure my wife and I were comfortable and satisfied with our stay. A truly magical experience in an awesome location.",50,23
"An amazing hotel on the best beach of Tulum. Simple, beautiful and full of life. The tent was ample, well decorated and comfortable. The property is a gem. Reminds me of Tulum as it was before it became popular. The magic continues at Casa Nawal. Paradise found! A 5 star stay.",50,23
"I would like to rate the hotel 5 stars, but due to misleading information about electricity and wifi I cannot in good faith. Casa Nawal is a beautiful spot with many great activities and wellness offerings on a clean section of beach. However, guests should be aware that they do not accurately represent the hotel online and are unapologetic about it. They advertise 24/7 electricity (a selling point because many other hotels advertise electricity cuts during  the day), as well as wifi. During my stay (August 2021), the electricity was cut everyday 11am-6pm and there was no wifi at all. When I mentioned it to the staff that they should have mentioned this on their website since guests have MANY options in Tulum and make their decision on where to stay based on these factors, the",30,23
" response was “sorry, yeah we told the manager to change the website but other guests don’t really complain about it so…” I was also told the wifi antenna was damaged during a recent hurricane and that NO other hotels or restaurants had wifi since the whole area was impacted, but then after challenging that and making phone calls myself, the receptionist was helpful in finding a hotel nearby to connect to wifi. It turned out that every other hotel and restaurant had wifi, so the original reply felt like it was an attempt to dismiss my request and brush off responsibility. It felt dishonest and the way it was handled made me feel like I was in the wrong for expecting electricity and wifi. I wouldn’t have stayed there if I knew ahead of time about the electricity cuts and lack of wifi. If those amenities don’t matter to you, then the generally dismissive attitude should nevertheless be a turnoff.",50,23
…,50,23
All I can say is. The right people work here and the service is top notch. My family and I arrived around 8pm and found Casa Nawal easy. We then had a bite to eat at the bar where the service was 5 star. I mean they want to make sure you are happy with the food and drink. We stayed for 1 night only in the tent right by the beach.   Please remember you are sleeping in a tent in the tropics. But the environment and people that are there is worth. It’s all about being free and good energy. The dinner was great and the breakfast was amazing. The prices are good.  Ok! On to the information you want to hear. The tent was great. The rest room is about a 3 min walk but it’s totally fine. Just bring a light with you. The shower is located in the same place. The have another community,40,23
 area where if you don’t want to eat at the bar and you brought your own food you can eat there. They have a yoga area covered about 20 feet from the bar so if it rains you can still do yoga which is great because our last day it rained and people were under it. The main entrance where you check in then you walk pass other cabanas until you reach the beach for the tents. You can view more photos on my Instagram @TravelWithJSmallwood I highly recommend.,50,23
…,50,23
"Our experience at casa Nawal was truly magical, totally immersed with nature and the uniqueness and charm of Tulum. Sleeping just steps away from the ocean under the light of the moon was amazing and swimming in the Caribbean waters watching the sunset over the Mayan Temple just made it an experience out of this world. The camp was a bit hard to find, look for Ikal hotel and walk the entrance all the way to the beach area, the Casa Nawal reception desk is a small table next to the Tikal restaurant bar. All personnel were extremely nice and courteous, tent was tidy and clean. Restrooms were also kept very clean, only concern was that there was no hot water. We did mention it to the maintenance person and he said they were at full capacity so they were probably just out. Waited",50,23
" until the morning and the same issue, had to take a quick freezing cold shower but guess that is not much of a concern over the summer months.",50,23
"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel in Tulum. The rooms are really nice, big and super clean.  Breakfast is simple and only 1 choice is included, if want more you have to pay. I would recommend to make a reservation without breakfast, there are a lot of other breakfast options outside/nearby.  The hotel also has a small swimming pool with some sunbeds. Also very clean. You can't really swim, but it's nice to cool off after a day exploring around Tulum.   The location is good to explore around Tulum by car (free parking) and a lot of restaurants only few minutes walking.   Only 1 complain, but thats something the hotel cant change...Next door is a rooftop bar with loud music. They are not open every evening, but 3 of 5 nights we stayed in the hotel I had to use my earplugs to fall",40,24

"Starting with the reservation. We had a problem and know one knew how to solve it. The hotel replies back only after 10 days and at the end they cancelled my reservation even with the pre payment. O called three times to the hotel with no solution.   At the end even worse, I was charged for a water we did not take. I paid for the water to avoid more time I this hotel. Terrible service.  Breakfast has basically no options and be prepared to go up some stairs for it!!  I would for sure not come back to this hotel.",40,24
"The good: the hotel is conveniently located, beautiful, the staff was friendly and it was immaculate. The bad: Although beautiful, with all the greenery, the courtyard is a haven for mosquitos.  I also did not like the locks on the room doors as they didn't make me feel safe and secure so I slept with a chair pushed up against the door (solo female traveler).",30,24
Great nice clean small boutique hotel in Tulum. Great location and amazing staff. Has a nice pool and located about 4 miles from the beach and strip restaurants. Lots of other restaurants within walking distance as well. Parking was available on site,30,24
I am looking for help and advise on how to find a driver who hit me with his suburban and sped away. The car is a rental and my friend was able to get a picture. We were outside this hotel so think there will also be security video. This happened on January 21 at about 12:50pm. Please help!!!,40,24
"The good:  Brand new property. Impeccably clean and well furnished. Convenient location, about 1 km to the „main strip“. Very courteous staff.  The bad:  Our bed was extremely soft and linens are really rough, starchy and uncomfy. Although the building is new, there’s very little sound proofing. Doors slam and squeak and you can hear your neighbours ... „talking“. During our stay (mid January 2021) there was loud construction in the early morning (6.00). It was practically impossible to get a good night‘s rest. Worst sleep in a three week backpacking vacaction, staying in way more basic hotels and B&Bs. Would have changed the hotel if I were to stay longer than one night. Sorry to say that thus I cannot recommend staying here.",30,24
"Nice place, nice hotel,maybe the best Boutique hotel i stayed at,location good just a few minutes walk to the main road with lots of restaurants,staff very nice and helpful,had a grand room in first floor and its a nice room,but if you want privacy you need to close the curtains because you have people sunbathing just outside the room,tv didnt worked first 2 nights but wifi was very good,changed to a grand with balcony for my last 2 nights and it was great tv worked but wifi was slow in this room,breakfast was good,the bed was really soft and nice,sadly there was a construction site just outside and they started 07:30,and last day before check out  there was a constantly hammering at the roof for hours,so glad that didnt happened the other days overall its a very nice and clean",30,24
" place with nice rooms for information the hotel dont have any bicycles for rent but there are plenty of them around,will recommend it and will be back next time in Tulum",50,24
"The design and decor is awesome. I would describe it as modern, eclectic, innovative, clean, comfortable, unique.  The design alone is worth a visit.  I personally liked that the bathroom was sort of open, meaning you are afforded privacy - but you are almost outside since you have just 3 walls and a ceiling.  The bugs were not a problem.  But I could appreciate that some people might not like this set up.  I felt safe.  The hotel restaurant is charming and intimate.    I only take 1 star away for noise.  We were able to drown it out with the air conditioner on.  If you like to sleep with windows open, or without air conditioner, noise could possibly be a concern.",40,25
We spent there 10 beautiful days! The place is located in the center of tulum in front of the Ado Station! The staff were really nice  and always ready to help! Maria and Lucia were really kind to us! The room was cleaned every day and the internet connection was really good! To make the long story short the perfect place to be! Thanks tulumena! Claudia.,50,25
"Wow. What a weekend. We came to Tulum to experience the culture, history, bars, restaurants etc. But we ended up staying at the hotel the entire time. The cocktails are spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, the service perfect. I have never been more content to sit and drink my poor liver to oblivion. After waking up from a heavy night and deciding to have breakfast and a coffee in their beautiful garden, we decided that this was all we needed to see in Tulum; this garden of Eden. Now 9 hours into our 3rd day of being at la tulumena we must leave and it is with a heavy heart that I depart this heaven, this paradise, here where in spite of ourselves we have made history in drinking more than the waitress had ever seen in her life I have discovered my second home.

We stayed at Tulumena one night & were very impressed. We were checked in by the sweetest most welcoming young lady. It is a boutique hotel with amazing Bamboo accents. Charming artwork throughout & live music at the garden restaurant. If we knew this place was such a gem we would of booked longer. The water pressure was strong with a modern rain head. We also have a balcony that we love. The A/C is strong in the room & it is impeccably clean. We will will definitely be coming back & I highly recommend it.,50,25

"The service is amazing here . The hookah is sooo good ! I had the love passion 69 sheesah. Definitely recommend coming here to relax and enjoy Tulum. Also , the drinks are natural & a decent price. Didn’t try the food but I bet it is hood as well . 10/10",50,25
"We were walking down the Avenida and came across this ahi Sha bar , it was an eye catcher but Don Rudy sold the whole experience to us , he’s an amazing waiter he’s on point and very conversational love it would definitely come back next time I’m in tulum",50,25
We were walking along el centro on our way back from some cenotes to Playa. Unique location with a great vibe and full of shade despite all outdoor seating. The cochinita pibil burrito and shrimp ceviche Tulumeña were awesome! It's worth the stop,40,25
Nice place with nice people. Good services. The room is huge with all what we need inside. The swimming pool is amazing. We rent a scooter in the hotel (they always have some disponibility). The restaurant is very nice with good quality food. Xperience is the place to be. Hope I can come again.,50,26
"From the moment you arrive, this feels like walking into a true tropical paradise and unlike any other hotel in the city. It is immaculate and massive with perfectly placed landscaping and a well kept pool with waterfall. The location is off the main path of the city so you can have a break from the loud endless party of the clubs of downtown, which is both a plus and minus for the time being. I'm sure the city will soon grow to encompass this in the heart of its' fast growing web. However, the people are what truly makes this place great. Their concierge was always available and very responsive and accommodating to any requests that we had during our stay. Btw, the rooms are wonderful. Not necessarily overly luxurious, but cozy with full sliding glass doors to open the entire",50,26

We had a lovely stay. Joaquin and Dilan at reception have always been super nice and super helpful. Thank you guys! We are looking forward to coming back again next time! Nice pool and well looked after.,50,26
Me and my partner absolutely loved his beautiful hotel. Its jungle inspired pool area with banana trees and a waterfall is just breathtaking.  The room was perfect sized with a fully equipped kitchen. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi with a view over the pool area. What a fantastic way to wake up to every morning and have a fresh cup of coffee out on the balcony.  The staff is super friendly and helpful 24/7.  There are plenty restaurants and bars within a walking distance from the hotel. Also local supermarkets and pharmacies.   Renting a scooter trough the hotel is highly recommended if you wish to explore Tulum and its beautiful beaches. Or you can rent a bicycle free of charge from the hotel.  Also do not miss their delicious cafe located across from the reception for freshly,50,26

"Almost perfect boutique hotel away from the garbage, trashy hotel zone.   We were robbed of $150 USD and hotel management didn't care.   Highly recommend staying here, however, be prepared for below average service for a 4 star hotel and, like us, you might be robbed",40,27
"First of, my friend and I arrived in Cielo Maya last August 13, 2021, Friday around 7pm. We were welcomed by the afternoon shift front desk (male). I paid directly to him for the whole stay. I also bought a tour for the Paradise lagoon. The male front desk personnel did not explain everything well to us. He only brought our luggage upstairs without saying anything. Normally, a hotel would tell us the room number and the wifi password. He is very disorganized. When we went to the tour the driver was asking for the ticket. Front desk did not tell us what to do. The ticket looked like a receipt. I thought the paper he gave me was a receipt. Last time, I travelled I purchased the tour from the hotel, but everything was well taken care of. I would normally be being picked up by the",10,27
" tour company. With Cielo Maya nothing was explained. The waiters are always rushing to get my plate even if I am still eating and enjoying my food. They only had 2 customers and they were fast to pick up our plates. There was a 15% charge At the restaurant. I was a guest I should NOT be charged with the service charge. Tips are given from the kindness of someone’s heart. Last Wednesday August 18 there was a strong hurricane. The water went inside our hotel room. This hurricane was an unavoidable situation. The electricity went off and was back the following day. The staff did not clean our room they only mopped it. I was expecting the trash was at least picked up. They did not check on us. It was very hot. The lights were on, and TV was working but the AC was the only thing that was not working. I asked them many times what happen with the AC. They said it’s not working, and the electricity cannot manage to make the AC work. I asked the front desk if they can at least provide us an electric fan. They said they don’t have any. I asked them how about the ceiling fan and the afternoon front desk guy said even those ceiling fans are not working. The following day on our last day the female front desk was able to make it work but too bad it was already our last day. We slept soaking in our own sweat for 3 nights. No one offered any help.  It was such an agonizing 3 days for me and my friend. I did not feel I was on vacation. People in Cielo Maya are liars. They lack empathy and compassion. They offered free massage on our last day when we were about to leave. I love getting a massage, but the oil will just make the heat worse. The lady at the front desk (am shift) woke me up on our last day. I did not ask her to wake me up. It was difficult for us to sleep especially there was no AC or a fan. The morning shift front desk also does not know what she is doing. I requested a van from her 4 days before our departure because our luggages are huge. Surprisingly, she ordered a sedan taxi. She said that’s what I told her. She does not know how to follow instructions.  I did not even say Taxi I said van/shuttle. This hotel gives poor service and yet they are fast asking for tips. I came back to our hotel room yesterday and I was surprised for an envelope asking for a tip. During the hurricane my friend had bad allergies. Her hives exacerbate during the night. I woke up and asked for help. Allergic reaction is a life threatening because if my friend’s trachea will close, she can end up not breathing. There was no onsite emergency help. I asked a graveyard shift front desk he said hospitals are closed. That’s a lie! THEY ALSO DO NOT HAVE A PHONE AND MY FRIEND AND I HAD TO GO DOWNSTAIRS IN OUR PAJAMAS TO THE FRONT DESK TO ASK FOR HELP!!! I DO NOT recommend this hotel if a guest has life threatening situation a guest can die without getting any help. This hotel is far from places. The road is bumpy and it’s not even on the main road! I looked for a manager before we left but there was no manager. All the staff at Cielo Maya are incompetent and have poor customer service. They are so fast to charge and ask for tips but very poor in service. The door is even hard to use. I used a real key not a key card to open it. The door is outdated. It took me forever to open the door. If I can rate this hotel -100  I will. Please do yourself a favor there are so many hotels in Tulum that are close to the city. DO NOT BOOK IN THIS HOTEL!! It only looks nice on the pictures. It looks very deceiving!!",10,27

"The hotel staffs in this hotel are unbelievably disgusting!!! Not generous at all!!! They are very very poor in communication because they do not know how to explain their policies nor what to do when we booked an activity, they want to let the guests figure out - very poor assistance!!! All they know is to ask tips tips tips!!! Is this what you do when a pandemic crisis is going on, to take advantage of the customers!? Aside from that, the servers are so annoying and too fast to want to clean up our plates while we were still eating. I thought that was very rude!!! So..., as the hurricane occured, electricity went down which was understandable and I had a very severe allergic reaction to the food I ate which I was not aware of and my friend asked for assistance downstairs but",50,27
" no one helped. The guy said, there are no hospitals nor anybody to take care of my issue. In this scenario, how do you run a hotel without even having atleast a first aide!!??? If I had anaphylactic reaction, I can die in this place due to their lack of services!!! I just cannot comprehend what gives them the nerve not to care!!! No sympathy! No compassion! At the same time when this was happening, as I said, electricity went down due to the hurricane so it even made me and my friend more discomfort. We ended up sweating sleeping in our bed for 3 nights without them offering even just a fan which I'm sure they can provide because they have generator. They were able to turn on the AC the first day the electricity went down, how can they not even at least offer a fan. Above this, the lack of attention to medical issues they cannot even come up with - how else with a simple fan to comfort and make their guests at ease, right!!?!! I was horrified!!! I am still recovering from the effect of what this hotel brought us. Worse vacation I've ever had, not to even mention what we went through outside this hotel. Thank God nothing worse happened to me aside from severe hives, stress, colds and fatigue.There are far better places than this since it is very far away from the center and the long bumpy road. Ugh!!!   So please....,!!! To the management, do not even tell my friend @kulengtubay that she cannot speak english!!! Please, your staffs, do not even speak very well english. Your arrogance shows how poorly you manage your staffs!! You do not even know how to accept your mistakes!!! Very unapologetic as if you provide a very excellent service. Even a negative 100 rate I can give this place from what we went through!!! No first aide service!!! Pheewwww!!!",50,27

"Pros: - Location and free parking outside. - Good wifi in the rooms - Comfortable beds and nice room. - The beach and the services - Most of the staff were friendly.  Cons: - We used the laundry service (which was good and quick), we paid by card and were told the payment declined so we used cash. Later we saw the charge in our bank app and when we told the staff, nobody paid much attention. It was just 6$ but it was an ugly detail (no, we didnt get it back)  - I was asked for a tip after our included breakfast. This may be subjective but ",10,27
"We had the nicest single night stay at this hotel.  It is north of Tulum (so not on the crazy beach road) and adjacent to Casa Cenote (a common tourist attration).  The water there is calm and clean.  The rooms are stunning with big tubs, beautiful views, and all the simple luxuries (coffee maker, fridge, cozy bed).  Breakfast in the morning was delicious and they had a very nice menu to choose from.  The dock, the pool, the water equipment were all really nice additions to our stay. We would have stayed many more nights if time allowed.",10,27
"Liked their place, clean and quiet, everything within a short distance.  Teams are very helpful and friendly. The  Waterfront is  gorgeous, private one, right at the rear entrance. Food is incredible, I’m planning to come here every time I go to Mexico.  ",50,27
"I travel to Tulum and I needed a place that was suitable for working and I found Selina Co working space, and it was a great option! . It offers you everything you need to get your work done, high speed wifi connection, good coffee, the most comfortable desks and private booths to go into your meetings. and a great quiet atmosphere, where you can also meet great people from all around the world. If you are looking for the best co working space in Tulum, go to Selina, im sure you are gonna have a great work experience! Special thanks to Juan, Astrid & Jahir for making my co working experience memorable while i was in Tulum.",50,28
"My girlfriends and I absolutely loved taking a girls' trip and staying at this hotel The location was awesome! They also have valet parking -Shoutout to Gabriel-!  All around I rate it a 10/10 for the view, location, breakfast, and quality of staff!",50,28
"Wouldn't recommend. Value for money is completely unacceptable. Front desk staff was not at all helpful most of the time... Found a much much nicer place with clean pool, private room three times the size of the selina room, no noise, private barhroom, very friendly and helpful staff in a hotel nearby for half the price.  Must say, at Selina the food and restaurant staff were amazing (even though the prices were completely over the top). The tourguides from mayikalexperiences are amazing.",20,28
"I was in Tulum for about a week visiting with friends and had previously booked at another nearby hotel, but found myself coming over to Selina and the Mia beach club every day! I eventually decided to switch hotels to join the group and it was the best decision I made.  When you first check-in the friendly Selina staff will store your luggage until your room is ready, and equip you with a bracelet which you'll use to enter the room and get discounts at Mia. The staff was extremely friendly and really made the check-in smooth.   The Selina rooms are designed to accommodate all kinds of budgets and living situations, from the community rooms to both the micro and private rooms. I opted to stay in the private room so I can't speak to the other rooms, but it was great! The rooms",50,28
" are modern and although the furniture and furnishings are extremely basic, they have everything you need for your stay.    The best part about staying at Selina is that it is adjacent to Mia, a really fun beach club and pool that you can hang out at during the day or party by at night. They have good food and drinks and you can relax at the day beds without a fee. Even if you have plans in Tulum the Mia beach party starts at around 7-8 so it's a great place to get your night started and enjoy good music / drinks before venturing out.   Selina is located on the Beach, so you really don't need to go far to get anywhere. The hotel rooms on the beach are more pricey but if you can afford it it's worth the price. Everything is nearby and it's really convenient staying on the beach, especially given that taking a Taxi around Tulum is expensive because the drivers negotiate their own rates (anywhere you go no matter how close is $20) and unfortunately there is no Uber.   Highly recommend Selina for friends, groups, bachelor / bachelorette groups, or any couples looking too mingle with others and enjoy their vacation.",50,28
…,50,28
Stayed at Hotelito Azul down from Selina’s but decided to spend the day enjoying the beautiful beach front grounds at Selina’s since the hotel i stayed did not clean the piles of seaweed on the ocean. Selina’s service and food on the beach was also exceptional. I would definitely recommend staying at Selina’s or at least hanging out for the day.,30,28
"I stayed at Selina for a week to ""work from home"" and enjoy some time. The Ocean view room was very loud. Selina is loud Thursday through Sunday and you'll need to be in the buildings away from the DJ stage. The location is excellent, right on the beach.   Breakfast at Mia was great every day. Service by Levi, Ricky, and Chego was outstanding. very great people.  Front desk was accommodating and friendly from Roberto (Posada Margarita), Camila, Alejandro, and Alfredo.  The entrance ladies were great too, Priscilla, Blanca, and Mica!  I really enjoyed my time in Selina Tulum and will be back!   Winston",20,28
"Pros: Included access to a great beach. Decent complimentary breakfast. Friendly staff. Plenty of nearby restaurants. They will store your luggage after check out,  Cons: Small room with shared bathroom was like a small humid college dorm room with a view to the wall. The above costs 200 dollars- there is no way I would pay 400 dollars for a private bathroom to stay here. Thin walls. Had to go to front desk to exchange towels. I ended up staying at two other nicer hotels the last two days but kept the room to store luggage and to use the beach. You might consider literally getting a hostel bed just for cheap access to their beach which was honestly better than other hotel beaches and breakfast and actually stay someplace else. This would be more cost effective than paying the",10,28
 minimum spend requirements at most beach clubs.,10,28
"The hotel was a little tricky to find but once we got there everything was a breeze. The hotel staff (Nacho and Francisco) where amazing and so helpful, from renting scooters and ATV, organizing taxis and recommendations. They added us to WhatsApp and we texted with any questions with immediate response!  The hotel is new and a part is still under construction but it didn’t affect our stay. Rooms and big and modern. Only 5 min cab ride from the beach. All in all I was recommend. Especially since the staff made everything so easy. Thank you and I’ll be back!!",50,29
"Gorgeous Hotel, very affordable for Tulum standard,  has an adjacent Beach club (Vagalume), very beautiful property, u need a motorcycle or a Bike rental to get around town easier, will definitely be coming back!! ",50,29
"The hotel itself is nice - it is modern, rooms are clean and well-designed. Plus, the non-management staff are nice and friendly. However, there are couple of things to be aware of: - The location is weird - it is neither close to the beach nor to the city center. It is impossible to take a walk or ride a bike to the beach or city, as the main road near the hotel is meant only for cars. - The management skills and attitude is extremely poor. They did not solve the robbery incident we had at the hotel room. - The breakfast portion size is small, has no variety, and should not cost USD $18!",20,29
"This is becoming one of the best opciones in Tulum. Geat location! Les than 5 minutes to the beach but still in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by nature and that Tuluminati vibe.  Super friendly  staff. Amazing pool area. Highly recommended!",50,29
"Wow it’s hard to describe this property in words which don’t do it just it justice. The appeal of this property is that it’s off the beaten path which is ideal after a long day of adventures. The grounds are beautifully kept. The food is amazing! Make sure you try  local beer they carry, Minera, it is delicious. Abel, the general manager and his team do a fantastic job of delivering the best customer service and make you feel right at home. The pool and hot tubs are pristine. Easy access to nearby areas as well. Make sure you ask about the story of Max, he survived a Jaguar attack. Thanks again and we will be back for another visit.",50,29
Hidden gem in the jungle. Such a gorgeous place and the service is always amazing! Beautiful place and amazing value! I have been there more than once this year and will continue to visit and recommend to any of my friends and family! ,50,29
"We were so happy with our experience staying here! The decor is striking with the contemporary jungle vibes Tulum is known for, the staff goes out of their way to make sure you’re comfortable, and the location is perfect for getting to downtown or the beach depending on how you want to spend the day. Plus having Max the hotel’s dog keep us company made us feel even more at home. We can’t wait to return here whenever we can get back to Tulum!",50,29
I stayed in tulum for a month and out of 3 places this is by the far the most amazing place I’ve ever lived. It’s BRAND NEW AND STUNNING!!! Right in the heart of the hotel zone 8 mins drive to everything beach related - 10 mins to downtown core. They have a shuttle for free that picks you up at 12 and drops off at 4 that takes you to vagalume beach club and you can walk to any beach club from there. They have room service and laundry service and a restaurant on site and bar by the pool and the hot tub upstairs. The absolute best staff Cheyo and rosalia and their on site pup Max will sure leave you feeling like you left a family behind when you finally leave. The coolest people have stayed here and we’ve met so many amazing people that help us find and get to where we need to get,50,29
 to.  I’ve had absolutely no issues with this place I didn’t lose power or water once in my week and a half stay there. The breakfast continental is included in most packages .   Stay here if you go to tulum it’s a site on its own to live in.,50,29

"My husband and I just returned from our second trip to Isla Mujeres and our second stay at Casa el Pio. I'm already ready to go back! Casa el Pio has cute rooms, a great little plunge pool, and a beautiful courtyard filled with amazing plants and trees. We started our mornings with coffee on the roof or in the courtyard (the coffee, by the way, is the real stuff, delicious and easy to make in the room), and the roof is also a great place to watch the sunset in the evening. The bed and pillows are very comfy, and the housekeepers work magic making the rooms spotless everyday.  Casa el Pio is also situated in a great spot on the island, just steps away from the ferry, great restaurants, and a small grocery store. Don't miss the delicious taco stand right outside the front gate,",50,30

"Casa El Pio is a very nice, small boutique hotel in a perfect location.  We particularly liked our room (Room 5), which is on the second floor and faces the Caribbean.  It was very spacious, the bed was comfortable and the view was superb.  They also have a nice rooftop deck - with a shaded canopy and nice lounge chairs.   Jose, the concierge, was a wonderful help, and the staff did an excellent job maintaining a clean space.  Will definitely be back!",50,30
I loved my stay at Casa el Pio.  Rooms are spacious and are decorated tastefully. The hotel have two different common areas and both are great. The roof terrace is a perfect place to watch the sunset.  A big plus in the room is the size of the fridge and the complimentary coffee  AND the quality of the pillows!!! Jose the manager is very helpful and will assist to get a golf cart or arrange any island activity.  I will for sure go back and stay at Casa el Pio.,50,30
"This place was an amazing stay, we keep coming back here whenever we stay at Isla Mujeres.  We most recently stayed for 4 nights in between Christmas and New Years. The entire staff including the owner, manager, and housekeepers are very friendly and helpful.  The room was in immaculate condition every day and the location cannot be beat.  There is an incredible taco cart at the corner where we got takeout and a Super Aki supermarket across the plaza where we got beers to enjoy on the roof deck.  We brought our well-behaved 8-year-old daughter, but made sure to confirm this with Hillary, the owner, beforehand -- she explained their no child policy, but was kind enough to make an exception for us.",40,30
"My husband and I stayed at Casa El Pío for 6 nights while on Isla. I can’t say enough great things about this hotel. The rooms were so clean, bright, and airy. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept on when not at home! Coffee maker, fridge, water supply all were great! The roof top deck was perfect! We watched the sun rise up there. It was windy a few days during our stay, so my hubby grabbed some drinks from the store and we used the loungers for the day. It was perfect! The location is ideal! We walked around everywhere and it was wonderful. Jose was great! He helped us secure a golf cart when we decided to explore the south side of the island. The cleaning staff, I wish I knew her name, did such a great job. Each day we came back to a wonderfully cleaned room! I",50,30

"Just returned from five lovely nights and enjoyed our stay! Room was bright, white and contemporary...used the refrigerator and the water bottles. Loved in-room self serve coffee. Shower and bath were nice too. Appreciated the attention from housekeeping. The hotel feels so quaint and private—saw one guest once during our stay.   My only complaint—and hear me out on this: room number five faces the public road and it is noisy even without town celebrations. Each night, I heard at least 3-4 dogs bark and then howl back and forth ALL NIGHT and a cat or two in heat screaming (sounded like a human scream). One night at 12:30 am a group of young adults had a shouting match and four of the men started fighting. A tall man in a cowboy hat came out of one of the homes and stopped the",50,30

Another was an Orange eagle creek bag small in size full of clothes, shorts, shorts, swim suits, things like that.  I don't care about the eggs & lettuce... obviously its too late to get those, but can I please have the bag in eggs were in & the orange bag full of clothes back?? I can pick them up in about 2 weeks. We know we left them there on the couch in the bottom room suite with the pool.   Please contact me back. The swim suit & shorts are important to us.  Thank you",50,31
"COVID Visit Dec 2020  We stayed here during the middle leg of our trip throughout the Yucatan peninsula. We had rented a car and wanted to find a place that allowed us to park for free and had more of an apartment layout. Amaka was overall one of the best values we could find based on their location, reviews, and amenities. We booked through hotels.com and chose one of the rooms on the first floor which came with a small private plunge pool.  Upon arrival we found that it wasn’t far off the main road but just far enough that it felt tucked away and private. Although there is construction nearby we didn’t find it to be a problem and either way you can’t blame the resort for something out of their control. When pulling into the parking lot we were quickly greeted by the 24hr",50,31
" security guard that is stationed in the lot which made us feel much safer leaving our rental there. Our check in process took no more than 2 minutes and the manager went over the details of what is available at the resort and the hours. They include a handful of bikes to use on a first-come first-serve basis as well as an outdoor dining area where you can help yourself to coffee, tea, and even a large 5 gallon of drinkable water to refill your own bottles. The property also includes a small gym which we did not go see but may be worth checking out if you stay for longer.  Once in our room we enjoyed the added privacy of our small pool and living area but the main pool is very nice but due to covid we chose not to stay out in the main area. The garden view villa came fully stocked with a full fridge, microwave, toaster oven, blender, coffee machine, and plenty of pots/pans and kitchen essentials. They also included some other things we didn’t think of like a large drink pitcher and even a small cooler which I’m sure you could use to take to the beach. There is plenty of storage throughout the place which could be great for more extended stays and there even is a washer/dryer combo machine available in the unit but you’ll need to get your own detergent. There is also a small safe which is yet another item that gives you more peace of mind. The only thing that can be kind of difficult is getting strong wifi connection all throughout the room but areas near the front should be fine and either way they clarify that when you check in.  We also appreciated the help from the staff in regards to their honest opinions of what our best options were to visit Tulum beach. Because we asked for help on where to park to see Tulum beach they mentioned a deal they had with a local beach club Mia. We were able to get two house drinks for free (1 per person) of either mojitos or margaritas and in return needed to order a food item and they offer free valet but just make sure to tip the drivers. This turned out to be a good deal since we went into it expecting to pay 50 USD minimum spending per person for their daybed use offer. This gave us a chance to drive our own car over, explore the beach area and have a few drinks at a nice place while also helping the hotel out with the referral. Overall this place was great for what it offered and we hope to stay here again the next time we come back!  @wanderingwithustwo",10,31

"Their safe is keyed where it should be guest passcode.  They are racist. They threatened to call  the police on us as that was to intimidate us. Please do note, we were the Ones being attacked in front of the security at the hotel.  On my arrival, I asked why don’t you have secured gates, they claimed The area is secure- LIE.  In regards to security, they’re bushes and jungle away from the HOT SPOTS- clubs and eatery. So you can see why regulating your taxis is a concern.  They offered a taxi from the airport who never showed up and cancelled on us. They didn’t check on us but when we got to the reception, their Comment was “oh that shouldn’t happen” but yet you want to regulate taxis  Don’t ever get tipsy or get drunk if you stay here  I called for a covid test as an American",40,31

"First timers in Mexico! We stayed in Tulum and at this hotel for 4 days. The staff was really friendly and helpful with everything. We used the hotel bikes every day, and it took around 20-30 minutes to get to the beach! You can Aldo easily ride bikes to the Mayan ruins by yourself (you don’t need a guide) There Are located 10-15 restaurants just around the corner from the hotel, so you don’t have to go to the main street or back down to the beach area for breakfast/dinner. This hotel delivered as expected!",50,31
"We stayed at Amaka for 6 nights in one of the apartments. The apartment was so spacious, in a beautiful setting. Bed was very comfy. During our stay the room was cleaned every day with fresh linen and towels, this made our stay even more pleasant. Loved sitting on the balcony as you feel really immersed in the jungle, great birdwatching spot, we saw toucans right in front of our window. We made great use of the kitchen for our breakfast, it comes with coffee maker, mini oven, microwave and blender, it was although missing some cutlery and tea towels.  The staff were so welcoming and nice, especially one guy that unfortunately I don’t remember the name of (he checked us in and show us around on our arrival), he was always very friendly. Fresh coffee and water is always available",50,31
"This is probably my 20th trip to Isla and by far my best.  Everything was so well curated and we felt so taken care of by Stephen and his amazing staff. They made us feel like they wanted us to enjoy every second of our stay, and went out of their way to make that happen. Check in was a breeze, the room (and most importantly the bed!) was very comfortable with spectacular patio views, breakfast every morning was amazing, the plunge pools are clean and refreshing, and the sunset happy hour was the highlight of our trip. Stephen is so fun and helpful with recommendations, it’s like hitting the easy button. We are already planning our next trip and can’t imagine staying anywhere else!  We were properly spoiled.",50,32
"This is a MUST STAY place. Everything was absolutely on point.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, clean and spacious. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning up sand dragged in form the beach and creating little towel figures to greet me at the end of the day. Breakfast was amazing- the kitchen staff do an incredible job preparing and presenting the dishes.  Happy hour was the most enjoyable- it actually facilitated strong friendships amongst a bunch of losers!! I highly recommend it. Margaritas, snacks, and good conversation. what more could you want? The location is perfect- right in town, close to the beach, and a great restaurant right across the street. Steve was a wonderful host, bartender and friend facilitator.  I will definitely be returning!",50,32
"It is always a treat for us to begin exploring Mexico by either starting or ending the adventure with a week at Casa Sirena on Isla Mujeres. Either way, a visit there primes you for your visit to Mexico or it evens you out as you get ready to go back home. The owner and staff are exceptional and pamper you with outstanding breakfasts, clean rooms every day, legendary hours, and for anyone who chooses to spend their day at the hotel, two excellent soaking pools, one on a rooftop terrace with views of the turquoise waters of the Caribbean and the waters between mainland Cancun and the island.  Casa Sirena is a true gem. It’s the main reason why we keep coming back to Isla Mujeres.",50,32
"As a first time visitor to Isla, Casa Sirena exceeded every expectation we had. Steve was a gracious   host that welcomed us into his B&B. The happy hour was a great way to mingle with guest and we enjoyed the roof top views. We stayed in room 6 and the view was amazing! Cannot say enough positive things about Casa Sirena.",50,32
I would give Casa Sirena a sixth circle if possible. Steve the owner is a great host and bartender and is most welcoming . There is a huge free delicious breakfast every morning where you get to meet the other guests as well as a free happy hour on the roof every evening where again you can mingle with people from around the world. The location is perfect to get to everything and quiet. The entire staff at Casa Sirena goes out of their way to make every guest comfortable and happy. I  really like everything about Casa Sirena,50,32

Each day started with a relaxing breakfast prepared to your liking, go with a different special each day, or order up an omelet or egg sandwich, just to name a few.

It also is out of town so more private but you can easily get to town with your golf cart rental in 5 min. The staff and owner are so friendly and helpful, and great to meet some very interesting people who are passing through. One could easily spend the whole time there if you wanted! as it has almost all the amenities you need.

The communal kitchen and all the social spaces were ideal for groups of people to spend time together. I loved the tiny private beach and the free use of kayaks and SUPs. I had one of the smaller rooms but it was just the right amount of space with a well-stocked kitchen to make coffee, reheat leftovers, mix drinks, etc. I used the industrial sized kitchen to cook bigger meals.  The hotel is conveniently located on a main road that's walking distance from everywhere I wanted to go but far enough to feel peaceful and quiet. It is next to the fishermen's cooperative which made it very convenient to buy fish directly to cook in the kitchen.  What made the stay unique was the",50,33

We do alot of cooking so this apartment fit the bill. We ended up extending our stay for 8 more days as 2 weeks just isn't enough and Eric the owner gave us our last night free. Eric and Inga are so great as are all the guys that work there.

"It's been a month since we stayed there, and i still think about it most days - it's hard to describe this place in a few sentences and to do it justice! The buildings, the gardens, the views, the people - it really is an oasis in a hectic world! If you want an authentic experience, go stay there. If you want party and all inclusive, don't. But why would you go to Isla Mujeres for the latter?? That's not why you come here. At El Milagro, all the units have very nicely equipped kitchen facilities (and they are BEAUTIFUL, Mexian tile!), and there are numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance. Playa Norte and downtown are also walkable, and we did it several times, but it's not for everyone - we felt totally safe doing it, but it was VERY HOT, so next time, we'll",50,33

All the staff are super friendly and we felt right at home from the start. I left there with a heavy heart, but I know we'll be back!! I think when we go back, we may just stay at the place for a few days without going ANYWHERE - we were at Isla for the first time so felt the need to explore (and loved it), but towards the end, we left the place less and less and just hung around all the beautiful outdoor areas - hammocks, beach loungers, the little pool which we spent hours in...I miss having my morning coffee out on the pier, watching - quite literally - the early birds :).

This hotel is great regarding location.  We spent the first part of our trip at a beachfront resort and the last 3 days at Naala. This hotel is beautiful and modern with a beautiful central garden and rooftop pool. Views of the jungle were great. The staff is pleasant and the food is amazing.  Close to Central Tulum and all the excursion meeting points. We will definitely stay here again.  There is construction going on next door but once in your room you don't hear a thing.,50,35
"10/10 hotel. Amazing. We stayed at hotel Na’ala for two weeks in April 2022. We could not fault the hotel. Not only is it beautifully decorated, it is kept spotless by the staff who seem to work around the clock and yet you never notice them as they go about their work and cleaning the rooms so discreetly. The waiters and bar staff are so attentive, we never had to go to the bar once as they are always coming over to attend to your every need and always with a smile and polite nature. I must say that this does come with a service charge, but if you do not want this then you can go to the bar yourself. The hotel breakfast was plentiful and there was much to choose from (eggs any style with meat / vegetable options and toast, pancakes with beautiful toppings, fresh fruits of all",50,35
" kinds, cereals etc. Coffee and fresh juice included. The hotel is in the most PERFECT location as it is about equal distance to the beach as it is to the town centre on a main road with the supermarket, hospital, police station, taxis within 100 metre walk and access to public transport just outside. The hotel also has a walk through access to a FANTASTIC patisserie ‘Antoinette’ and Italian restaurant ‘Casa Sofia’ sat in front of it which were both unbelievable places to eat when not wanting to venture too far. I’d 100% recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tulum. And May I also add that Tulum itself is wonderful - paradise jungle and beaches on either side of the road, it’s both luxury and boho. The prices on the beach are expensive, but cheaper alternatives can be found in the town.",50,35

"There is absolutely nothing bad I can say about hotel!  Hotel is beautiful, well kept, clean, and staff are wonderful!! Pool area is stunning and clean with great music played throughout the day and not to loud! Close enough to access all areas around by foot restaurant old town or new area down beach. Drinks and food great abet expensive but that’s just tulum as we have discovered.   Rooms are beautiful and cleaned daily with added bonus of Netflix on tv!  Thank you staff for a excellent stay. ",50,35
"It could be a nice hotel, but there is no control or service to monitor guests. People party in the room all night, security doesn’t care. If you love noise and sleepless nights and days this is the right place for you. Around lunchtime they bring a DJ on the roof until late at night and you’ll be forced to listen to techno music because you can hear everything. I will never return to this hotel and I do not recommend it. Definitely don’t come here if you are looking to relax.",10,35
"This place is in one word FANTASTIC! It’s so beautiful, the staff is super friendly and for my birthday they gave me a wonderful surprise in my room. Thank you so much! We are absolutely loving our stay here. The pool on the rooftop is stunning and the many seating options around it are the perfect way to spend your day relaxing in a beautiful setting. Breakfast is also great. Oh, and the bed is sooooo comfortable!! I could sleep for 12 hours in it :)",50,35
"Me and my family stayed at the hotel but we got robbed. They stoled my father’s wedding ring and they did not do anything about it. I don’t recommend the hotel at all, a happy family trip turned into a bad and sad experience. Be careful with your belongings because the hotel will not respond and get responsible for this type of incidents.",50,35
"My partner and I had an incredible six day stay at Naala from beginning until end. A stunning hotel, with very friendly and helpful staff, tasty breakfast, exceptional facilities. Our room was beautiful, extremely clean with a gorgeous interior. Couldn’t recommend this hotel enough",10,35
"After seeing several negative reviews online, I was really sceptical about visiting Naala. However, these low reviews could not be further from the truth.  The hotel staff were lovely and truly helpful with anything we asked- it felt like a home from home. The pool area was beautiful with gorgeous views for such a bargain price. The location in my opinion is perfect, in the middle of the beach and town you get the best of both worlds. It’s also right next to a lovely Italian restaurant which is very reasonable and we visited several times.  The only slight downside is if you want to visit beach areas you need a taxi each time, however this is commonplace in most of tulum and prices are easy to negotiate.",50,35
"I've been on many trips in my life, but the hospitality of the Crew at Aldea Cazul was impeccabile!  They have security that makes you feel very safe, cleaning ladies that literally left your house spotless morning and night, and Cynthia, Mao and Leo that were available LITERALLY 24/7 to help you with anything you needed.  The sweetest, most thoughtful crew and they made this trip x10 better!  The house was something out of the movies and the beds are so comfortable.  Anyone complaining about the noise should stay home! We are in Tulum people! It's normal to hear music play at night! Plus you are right next to some of the hottest spots in Tulum so you should be happy you don't have to walk too far.  Amazing stay, and we will be back next year for sure   Melissa L.",50,36
"From the moment we arrived we were treated with exceptional warmth and service by Cynthia, Leo and Mau. They are truly beautiful, kindhearted people.   Behind the private, security gates lies the oceanfront property that is absolutely stunning and meticulously maintained. Attention is paid to every detail including the evening candlelight that made everything appear magical.  Pre arrival communication for transportation, villa supplies, securing a chef and bartender as well as covid testing was flawless.  The villas were spacious, beautiful and impeccably clean.   Everyone and everything was spectacular. We will definitely return!",50,36
"We were a group of 12 spending a long weekend to celebrate a lifetime milestone…  On arrival we were surprised at the car service stopping.  There were no signs of any sort  announcing that we had arrived at Aldera Canzul (as the trip unfolded,  we completely appreciated the security and discretion we were met with).   Our driver rang the bell and the gate opened wide to the most beautiful place, the most welcoming staff and the most luxurious spaces I have experienced in recent memory.  Cynthia, Leo, and Mau greeted us and made us feel immediately welcomed and valued.  We stayed for four days, and that feeling never changed.  They always had time to answer questions for us and make arrangements, wonderful humans!  We occupied the main villa and the suite with it’s own roof top",50,36
" pool.  The spaces were very well appointed and meticulously maintained.  The housekeeping and ground staff set everything straight every morning.  They were around but never intrusive and always helpful.  This experience was amazing from start to finish and I cannot wait to come back!!  Laura M Virginia, USA",50,36

This is the ideal property in Tulum.   Located in walking distance to the best restaurants.   Gated.  Secure.  Hosptality was first class.  They coordinated chefs for breakfast every morning.  The property is very spacious and on the beach.  We had 12 guests.   Staff is cleaning and sweeping constantly.   We will  100% return to this property.,50,36
"If your searching got you this far STOP LOOKING! You have found the perfect place. Best property in Tulum, hands down. From the road you can't see what lies behind the gate but when it opens (almost by magic by the always present and always unobtrusive security guards) and you walk in, it will take your breath away. Incredible beauty in every direction. The three separate buildings form a compound of interconnected pathways leading  to dipping pools and rooftop decks, amazing suites and shaded lounge areas,  the spectacular beach and chairs, umbrellas, kayaks, cold coconuts and anything else you could want. The staff is exceptional. Mau, Leo and Cynthia are the most helpful, friendliest and loveliest people on the planet who truly want to make every day exceptional. And they do.",50,36

"All the negative experiences in this lodging almost ruined my entire vacation. I’ve listed the pros and cons below and you can decide whether you want to risk it, but I’d strongly recommend against staying here, it was an absolute nightmare.  Pros:  1.	The room had a good size and nice decoration (A Deluxe King Room #1) 2.	Jose was very nice and helpful 3.	Good location 4.	Good breakfast place right in front and next door  Cons:  1.	We had no electricity for nearly 3 days, and it was only Suites Tulum, all the surrounding hotels had electricity 2.	Wi-Fi doesn’t work, we were only able to get a signal if we stood by the room’s door or if we stepped out into the inner courtyard 3.	Mariano, the concierge, is the nastiest hotel employee I’ve ever experienced. Flat out came into our",10,37
" room and screamed at my friend and I that both of our cell phones didn’t work and that’s why we didn’t get Wi-Fi (we both have iPhones) and then told his colleague that my friend and I were both crazy 4.	Toilet doesn’t flush 5.	We arrived at the hotel to find a huge puddle of water on the bathroom floor because the sink was leaking. My friend nearly slipped and fell on the puddle during the night when she woke up to use the bathroom 6.	Bathroom window leaks adding to the puddle of water on the bathroom floor 7.	If your departure from Tulum is not directly after check-out at 11am, they refuse to hold your luggage until you leave although they have a storage room that locks",10,37

"Please note we paid $196 Canadian  Dollars a night for this place ($154 USD). Figured to save some money on restaurants as it came with a kitchen. ARRIVING: The hotel is situated on a 9 kilometre stretch  of road littered with hotels, restos, bars,boutiques, tourist traps, other junk, and horrendous bumper to bumper traffic ( cars, buses, taxis, scooters—think of Manhattan cross-town traffic, only worse.) Given that Suites Tulum is located behind a bar and they don’t have the decency to have a sign or any other indication showing where they are, it took us an hour to find them. Many stops, asking people in the tortuous traffic. Even when we knew where the hotel was hidden, it would still take a good 40 minutes to crawl the 9 kilometres less than 6 miles). They told us that",10,37
" directions had been texted on the date of our arrival. Didn’t see them. I have a funny habit. I don’t read text messages when driving. THE ROOM: The word “plain “ comes to mind to describe it. Also “ total lack of charm”. The kitchen was minimalist. For example, no cooking utensils, frying pan, or dish towels. For our clothes, 2 minuscule shelves (like really, really tiny) and 3 hangars. The lighting can best be described as perpetual obscurity. We did have a patio— 2 cheap, uncomfortable chairs and a very low table that made dining ever so uncomfortable with a view of the ....parking lot. And forget evenings on the patio, no lights; total obscurity. And speaking of parking, Suites Tulum generously offers 3 parking spaces for their 10 rooms. If one requires anything, just ask the manager. We didn’t see him after check in, though we could text him through WhatsApp. He never responded. Also, a concierge. This guy we could talk to in person. Unfortunately, he was as useful as the manager. Any and all requests went unanswered.  The room had 2 ceiling fans. One screeched incessantly when turned on. Very painful to the ears. The other simply didn’t work. The concierge said he would make a report. Great! However, never got fixed during our 4 night stay. Remember, we were paying close to $200 a night. And under the guise of being ecological, the electricity was turned off every day for unexpected périodes of time. Each day had a new no electricity schedule. The power is generated from solar panels. To be fair, this inconvenience was mentioned on their web site, but total silence on Expedia, on which we booked our stay. Let’s just hope they go bankrupt, thus allowing other travellers to avoid this hideously, horrible, hellish hotel.",10,37
…,10,37
"This was our second stay in Suites Tulum in 2 years. The place has now been renovated and they have added new rooms and a rooftop with a small pool and really amazing views, 360 degrees you can see the jungle and the sea. We got one of the new rooms and it was cozy and nicely decorated. The beach is still as beautiful as it was 2 years ago and you are right across the street from it, just 2 minutes walk.",50,37
"The owner cancelled my reservation 3 days before my trip, she said I needed to “reconfirm” my reservation or else she would cancel without giving me a refund. Please tell me why I would need to reconfirm a trip that I already paid for and confirmed several times? I paid for this trip in March 2020 and wanted to cancel because of the shutdown, but Daisy asked me to keep it because they were struggling due to cancellations. Well I felt bad and kept the reservation knowing I’d go eventually, but even giving her 11 months notice of my new trip, she managed to mess up our dates and then tried to blame us. You can NOT trust this management company. She will not give us any sort of refund and we did not stay there because she WOULD NOT LET US. Horrible way to run a business. Do not",50,37

"Before choosing to stay at Hotel Muare we read the reviews and viewed the images of this picturesque hotel . It seemed perfect ..  away from the hotel area, small intimate boutique style, sorrounded by nature , a spa , pool w day beads , restaurant and bar , who needs more .  As soon as we walked in it was picturesque perfect.  Exactly like the pictures we had seen.  We were greeted w smiles and friendly faces.       Praise must be given where its deserved Nydia and Fili were phenomenal! Their attention to customer service was superb! Daniel and Mauricio at the bar make fantastic drinks as well.  Nicolas and Antonio were also very friendly we just didn't get a chance to get to know them as much as the others.  Chef Julio made my birthday very special with special dishes he",20,38
" personally brought to our table . We were in awe ! We were so happy  be at the hotel...   Things quickly started turning . We noticed ants in our room and bed every night . I understand we are surrounded by nature but we didn't expect to find them throughout the night as we were woken up by them .  After this we started noticing many things the hotel was falling short on . For example .. very small detail.  Yet impressions matter .. our room's Reed diffuser was empty , there are small gaps in the rocks for the outside shower.. not a big deal except our room was next to the pool and so is the shower.     As far as services that are really lacking .. the day beds and bean bags are super comfy and chic however they are always full of leaves and bugs . In my opinion if you are trying to build an image you should have a pool concierge who as you come to the pool they grab your towels , shake off all the leaves and bugs  for you since again .. you are sorrounded by nature so it's only natural this would happen ...  the pool everyday we were there was full of leaves both floating and sunken as well as ants and other insects .  With that many trees management should keep up with this so their paying guests can enjoy a pest and leaf free pool .   The spa .. well .. its not finished . The pools were filled w leaves it looked  semi abandoned .( beautiful architecture , though )    What I would say was the worst part is that everyday outsiders would come .. Influencers to take photos In the resort.  Most of them were very subtle and quick . They did not disturbed the paying guests or anything.  Our last full day there were 2 woman there w 4 camera men and a flying drone all over the pool and hotel area.  There was 0 concern for guests intention of wanting to relax and enjoy an intimate gateway  . They were all over the hotel and pool , next to our day bed, directing, having a buzzing drone flying all around you and above you .  Management dropped the ball . You should have let guests know this was happening especially since this was over 5 hours!!! They took away our smoking bug defogger for their precious photo shoot while guests were getting bit by mosquitos .  You care more about what an influencer portrays your hotel as ( and may I add these influences are not paying guests, nor do they actually stay in your facility.. they pose and create fake illusions of reality) while your guests reality and opinions do not matter to you.  I may not care to have a million followers but I have friends that travel often and word of mouth and reviews are just as powerful . It's a shame because Muare has a lot of potential and it is really a beautiful place . If the owners and management apply themselves a little more and dedicate a little more care into guests stays they could be a hit .    Hopefully others experience will be better than ours.    I hope in the future the owners are more concerned with the satisfaction of the guests they have in house at the moment rather than an influencer.    I would definitely not recommend this hotel . Maybe a day pass for $30 minimum consumption but not for anything else . We would definitely not ever be back.",50,38

I had the pleasure to stay at this newly designed hotel in April. The whole place Oozes with style.  Well done to the architect for such a well planned layout of the grounds. The room I stayed in was stunning. Lovely comfy bed. Dreamy drapes & sofa. With a private jungle garden and plunge pool. Fell asleep in the hammock one day. Loved the outdoor shower and organic products. Moody lighting. Perhaps more light in the bathroom area. Appreciated the full length mirror. Wi-Fi worked well.   I enjoyed relaxing and swimming in the curved pools. The day beds on the water is a great idea.   The restaurant served tasty food. For breakfast there was so many choices included in my room rate.

"The breakfasts were fantastic! Our host, Juan, was incredible. He was generous and super helpful. He also gave us great recommendations for activities/food. Every recommendation was amazing. Honestly, our vacation wouldn't have been near as great without Juan's help and staying at La Selva Mariposa. I have already recommended this place to friends. It is beautiful, comfortable, and enchanting. And, you get to listen to the sounds of the jungle while falling asleep!",50,39
"La Selva Mariposa is a lovely paradise tucked away in the jungle just outside Tulum. The property is artfully laid out with private and semi-private bungalows among several pools and water features.   We found the rooms cozy and comfortable, each one a work of art. Breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious, the staff were friendly and helpful, and Juan took exceptional care of us during our stay.  We found the property to be a great location for getting to all of the sites.  We ventured to Coba, Valladolid, several cenotes, Tulum and the beach.  What a wonderful gem!!",50,39
Tucked away in a village on the road between Tullum and Coba - a quiet retreat. Juan looked after us very well and helped us get to Coba to explore the ruins and onwards to Tullum after our stay. Great fresh breakfast served outside in a quiet area in the jungle complex. It even has a cenote on site - though not one you would swim in - but can gaze down into. jungle noises and frogs to accompany your evenings and a great Italian restaurant a short walk through the village - he makes his own pasta.,50,39
"La Selva Mariposa is the perfect base to explore Tulum, Coba and all of the beautiful surrounds. Everything is a short distance away, and you get to enjoy the tranquility of the jungle without the constant hum of tourists in the hotel zone. Juan and the staff are ready with wonderful recommendations for food, cenotes and ruins. We had delicious breakfasts every morning and were even able to cook ourselves dinner for the first time in a month thanks to Juan’s generosity.  The room was beautiful with lots of authentic touches and an open bathroom. It was very clean with comfortable beds and all of the amenities we could have wished for.

"We decided to stay here at LSM because we wanted to be close to the cenotes and ruins. I found this little charm here on TA and decided to get it a try. Let me first start off by saying it's not your typical hotel (b&b). Its placed out in the jungle and a little hard to find since it's not off the road. The room was so charming and had an authentic Mexico feel to it, with the shower being exposed to the outdoors, oh man was it beautiful. The staff here are really nice and the breakfast was delicious. However, I feel that the place is missing something, I cant really say exactly what it is but I feel that more can be done here. One day we felt like no one was here and it so happened we were out of hot water. We lasted 2 days without hot water until my husband noticed another tank",50,39

"Orchid House Tulum is a five star facility located in a new built-up area of Tulum, a 10’ drive away from the city centre.  The positive aspects of this facility include its aesthetic beauty, with a unique, Gaudi-like architecture, an amazing bar&pool area, beautiful rooms with large comfortable beds and a good ratio price& quality. Unfortunately, the negative aspects well-exceed the positive ones: in a five-star hotel one should never find stained bed linen, dirty bath robes (mine had clearly been used before and had stains of foundation everywhere). Moreover, within a few hours of our stay we recognised a sewage smell that got worse each day of our stay. I should also mention here the insects that invaded our room constantly - giant ants, beetles, etc - but this is also due to",20,40
" the setting in a green area.  We tried the food and a number of cocktails and were not particularly impressed, so I would not recommend having dinner here.  Lastly, what differentiates a five-star hotel is service, which is practically absent at Orchid House, with the staff at the desk being unprofessional and unfriendly. All in all, our impression was that this hotel is truly beautiful aesthetically, but plenty of work is still needed in terms of maintenance and service.",50,40

"We loved staying at Orchid house, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were able to help us get around and to get to know the area. The architecture and items are eco friendly and it’s embedded in lots of nature, which made me feel like I was in the heart of a jungle.  I would definitely come back to this beautiful boutique hotel and recommend it to everyone!",50,40
"I have held off on this review for months, but I feel like my fellow travelers should be made aware of what happened during our stay at the Orchid House.  First, I do want to point out the good – the food was really good (continental breakfast, a la carte breakfast, and their tacos).  Drinks were also really good.  We loved the rooftop plunge pool, as well as the room size.  The bug repellant in the room was a very nice touch.  We were a total of 3 females, and we had 2 suites with plunge pools (1st floor) and 1 jungle suite (2nd floor).  Now, the ugly.  I have traveled a lot (domestically and internationally), but never have I experienced ANYTHING like this.  The staff was so sweet and welcoming in the beginning.  The AC in my room (suite on 1st floor) started to leak and had",50,40
" water all on the headboard and nightstand.  I requested them to clean my room since they would need to clean up the water.  When we returned late afternoon to get ready to visit the ruins, they informed us of an additional $150+ charge due to makeup on the towels, sheets and facecloths.  We were confused because we were only aware of 2 facecloths with makeup on them. They said they did not have a washer or dryer on site, and they have to send everything to the cleaners.  I am big on being proactive…if the policy is NO makeup on face cloths, that should be conveyed during check-in (we stayed at an AirBnB in Italy that told us this during check-in).  When I told them this, they simply said – you signed a document when you checked-in.  There was no understanding or acknowledgment.  The other ladies argued if that was in fact the policy, they should probably reconsider white facecloths.  I was shocked that no reviews mentioned anything about this because it’s 2021 and I highly doubt no one has ever gotten makeup on their facecloths.  The staff became cold and the man at the front didn’t even look at us when we were speaking.  He continued to do what he was doing as if we were not there.  I asked for the dirty sheets and face cloths.  I have attached pictures so you all can really see (ALL PICS ARE PRIOR TO BEING SCRUBBED BY US).  We scrubbed the face cloths with soap and water and EVERYTHING came out.  The bride-to-be was furious because this was her bachelorette trip and we missed the ruins due to having to scrub the towels and facecloths (this was also our last night in Tulum).  I told the front desk they should inform people that are of a darker complexion so there will not be an issue like this again. We decided to sleep on top of the towel and blanket the last night to ensure nothing got on their sheets (not even sweat).  The mosquitos ‘tore us up!!!’ We ended up telling a couple that was staying there.  The lady (Caucasian) became furious and made sure her husband was there waiting for us the next morning.  He escorted us to the front desk to make sure all charges were removed.  She stated she had wiped her makeup off and no charge was ever mentioned.  I do not want to assume it was due to our race, but I do want people to know what we experienced.  Hopefully their policy has changed and hopefully no one else will have to go through such as thing on their vacation.  Lastly, this was my 3rd time coming to Tulum within months.  I cannot recommend this place due to what we experienced.  If the situation was handled differently, I would be more than happy to recommend it.  Note: the charges were removed 100%, but it took anger, frustration and time to get that outcome.",30,40

What seemed to be the ideal getaway for grown up travelers looking for some quiet turned out to be a place where groups of Instagram-obsessed youngsters go to hang before going to parties and crash after parties. The noise level was entirely unbearable. Add to this the paper thin walls and the incredibly noisy piping that creaks all night long and forget about sleeping. Laughter, loud music, slammed doors all day and night, and the hotel is not disposed to do anything about it unless you beg them...and even then. Breakfast is mediocre, but the setting gorgeous.

I made a reservation and even though it was already accepted by the hotel they cancelled it 1 hr before the check-in. Its supposed to be a luxury LGBT hotel but they need to improve their booking system - BE AWARE that they might cancelled your reservation when you are already there,10,41
The Hotel itself is nice and the staff friendly. The rooms are clean and of reasonable size. But they're stripped down to the bare minimum which means there isn't even a proper place or hook to hang a towel or wet swimming trunks. The walls are quite thin as well so you can really hear if some people are coming bsck late at night. We felt quite safe at the place since there is a security guard and everything's locked. Staff is super helpful as well and we loved the owners dog Bruno.,10,41
"The hotel is built out of metal shipping containers. Great concept for recycling but there's a reason why hotels and houses are NOT built using shipping containers. They do not breath, and traps all the moisture inside. This is construction 101. We went into the room and it was full of mold spores, so bad we were coughing so bad.  So we cancelled the hotel, and left. They refuse to refund the charges and charged our credit card anyways.  We've called several times and no response!!!!  and the rooms were sooo basic, there's a bed and that's it. not even a closet.   Total SCUMBAGS! BEWARE!!!",50,41
"BUYER BEWARE!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL AT ALL COSTS!  If I could give negative stars I would!!  My boyfriend and I booked our stay at Hotel Barro Negro from December 29th, 2019 - January 10, 2020.  We planned to stay at the hotel for two weeks during the electronic music festival and were looking for a place we could go back to and just relax after long days at the beach and attending the music events.  When we checked in we were given a brief walkthrough of the property.  The rooms are basic at best and all have smart TVs, which was fine since we really just wanted to be able to watch a movie at the end of the night to wind down.  The internet worked for about 30 minutes and then went down.  When we asked about when to expect the internet back up and running they said they",10,41
" were working on it.  After two days of no internet and not being able to use the TV and hearing several other hotel guests complain of the same issues we asked if we could be let out of our reservation.  They came to us with a resolution and said they could let us out of our reservation and we were promised a refund for the remaining 12 days of our stay in the amount of approximately $1200 USD.  We spoke with management and they were to refund us within 10-12 business days.  We were happy to find a resolution and booked an Airbnb that better fit our needs.    We checked out of Hotel Barro Negro on December 29th and moved to the Airbnb.  After a couple of weeks and no refund we contacted Hotel Barro Negro to find that the management personnel we worked with was no longer with the hotel.  We have since contacted the hotel several times and they have changed management several times.  We have also learned several other customers have had similar issues with the hotel, with them losing reservations etc.  This is quite alarming as we are not people who just have $1200 to throw away.  The hotel does not respond to emails, does not answer the phone and if they do they either don't speak english or are not helpful what so ever.  They seem to change management every couple of weeks and the customer service is horrendous.  My only hope is to try and help other people not fall victim to this hotels predator business practices.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!",10,41

"I spent 6 nights in Barro Negro with my girlfriend and we just loved it. The staff is really friendly and helpful with everything we needed (including tour tips). The rooms are clean, modern and the environment around is really calm and peaceful.  The hotel is a 5min drive from Tulum centre and 10min from the main public beaches, which is really convenient.  They do not serve breakfast but you can get a tea or coffee at any time. They also let you put your drinks and food in their fridge.  Highly recommend!!!",50,41

"Amazing from the moment I made my reservation, their online concierge took care of absolutely everything I needed for my family to spend an amazing holiday in Tulum, this is by far the most relaxing place in the area, the vibe of every single person here is just right, all servers and employees have the right set of values and understanding of the guests in the kindest level.   You feel like in a village, a community way more than you feel in a hotel, it is absolutely peaceful and private and I'm definitely coming back every time I visit Tulum from now on.   Hands down my best time ever from my many visits to tulum.",50,42
"The place is incredible: architecture of the hut, view from its terrace above the jungle (perch), small private garden, outside bathroom; suspended and comfortable bed at 2mn from the beach.  The service is horrrendous from beginning to end: from check in to the restaurant. The only smiling person was a young man at the reception (Nicky?) who did his best and was systematically ignored by the others. No possibility to have breakfast in his room. We waited 45mn for a coffee and chocolate pancakes or should I say a chocolate fillet, so doughy that we couldn't eat them and the waiter demanded a tip l!!!!! We tried to dine there one evening because the hotel is far from everything but after 30mn of waiting, we left elsewhere.   A very unpleasant experience despite the place.",20,42
Avoid at All cost!! This is a warning to anyone considering staying at this hotel. this hotel is run by unscrupulous people who will do everything possible to steal your money. If there only use cash.  Read the multiple reviews on all travel pages. Tulum and Mexico are beautiful. I can’t believe they’re still in business after all the bad reviews and experiences.  Please save yourself the bad moment. There are multi olé great hotels on that same location.   Specially avoid it for single women or families with kids. Lot of unhealthy things happen there.  Photos posted are not accurate for reference this is an updated photo of our bathroom.  Sad to see,10,42
"Worst place I have ever stayed. Completely ruined my vacations.  The locations is absolutely amazing. But the people who run it are just mean, specially their manager Ana. Place is all very decadent , full of junkiea,  very sketchy people and a very bad vibe. Probably a very specific type of tourism that is not on my style.Absolutely not for smilies or kids.  Infrastructure probably was good some years ago, but now is old and badly maintained.  DO NOT trust the photos they post, those are very old. Don’t leave your credit card info available. One thing was great, the beach is amazing.",10,42
"We arrived in August and the first cabana they put us in was moldy. They switched us to a nicer cabana where we were supposed to stay for the rest of our trip 5 nights total. It was 90 degrees and the air conditioner didn't work. I got bit by a million ants that were on the bedside. We ended up leaving the property after 2 nights because it was supposed to be a relaxing vacation but there was nothing relaxing about no AC and bug bites. We spoke to the manager and she was empathetic, she was going to give us back 50% off our stay because we only stayed 2 nights in a non-functional room (not a full refund). I was fine with this. We had to spend money to buy a new hotel for the remainder of trip. They owe $550 and I gave them my bank details, right when I got home, the kept making",10,42

It’s quiet at night, and it’s not too far from the centro or other hotels. And the beach is right next to the restaurant. And our room had A/C which was perfect. Loved everything about this place.",50,42
"We stayed here over March break thinking we were getting a really good deal for the beach area but you definitely get what you pay for. Food was really bad,  Pool not taken care of (it was falling apart). The jets weren’t even kept on. And there was a night club that was blasting music all night. Also agree with another review that the check out process was really odd. We caught the security guard taking our  picture without our consent. I’m still not sure why he did that.  Would never stay here again or recommend this hotel to anyone.",20,43
"I feel so sad to write this, we wanted to love it. We DID love the beautiful woman who checked us in but that's absolutely where it ended.   As other reviewers mentioned, the 'unce, unce, unce' of the place next door went ALL NIGHT LONG. We didn't sleep at all. Overall, Tulum is no place for children (lesson learned), but this was ridiculous.  We didn't eat at the restaurant, didn't even stop in for our 'free' breakfast. Didn't look inviting.  The WORST part of it came at the end. We told everyone we had an early flight and had to leave at 6am. They asked if we could settle up before we go, so we did this the night before.  So at 6am we are in the reception area with a security guard who refused to believe that we had done so, no note was left. We were literally locked inside.",10,43
" He went to the bar area to find whateve we didn't pay for and brought a reciept for margaritas for room 5, like AHA! Yeah man, we are in room 6. We told him to call a manager, he said he wouldn't until 7am. He then asked to take a photo of our credit card.  Ummmm....NOPE. How stupid do you think we are? Then he took pics of US. Seriously? In front of our children, this is how you behave? The kids started to say 'no mister, we didn't eat here, we didn't drink anything', they were scared. There's a huge chain and lock on the front door and he had our car key. Awful, awful, awful experience. There is nothing appealing about this crappy place and I hope enough people read this so it shuts down and can be run by professionals who don't scare children and don't treat guests like criminals.",10,43

"This hotel sells itself as a tranquil spot on south beach Tulum.  It is next door to a beach club Bagatelle which plays heavy drum and bass music from 11 am - 1am everyday.  When you arrive at the hotel they make you pay full costs up-front before showing you to your room, we questioned this and were told it was hotel policy?  We were given a very cool reception when we asked for a refund and after a 2 hr discussion were refused with the explanation that the owner is no longer giving refunds and guests were to put up with the noise.  At the weekends they bring in their own DJ and then play even louder music to drown out the next door beach club, the music is played loudly to entice holidaymakers walking the beach to pay for a sunbed and use the restaurant.    We informed the",10,43

Whilst we were there the inclusive full breakfast was reduced to continental, they gloss painted the stairs and banisters up to our room and turned off the mini-bar fridge - all very questionable behaviour for a 5 star hotel.

"If you’re looking for a quiet and relaxing hotel as advertised on their website, stay away! We booked 5 nights at Villa Las Estrellas and had to leave after only one. There is a very loud beach club next to the hotel, playing music from 1-7 pm, which makes it impossible to relax. When the music stops there, the nightclub behind the hotel starts playing music until 2 am, which makes it impossible to sleep. Our floor was trembling and there was permanent light from the hallways coming through a window in our room. We asked to be reimbursed as we couldn’t enjoy the beach or sleep and after almost two hours of negotiations, they agreed to only give us 50% of what we paid back.  In general, the price of the hotel is way too high for what it has to offer. The pictures on their website",50,43

"I have stayed at Holistika 3 times. The first two were excellent stays, however, my most recent stay left me a little disappointed. The reception is usually wonderful, however, this time they were just average. They did not welcome with a smile and seemed confused. I had to ask for a bath towel which is included, and things were not explained. The bathroom in the shared dorm was not cleaned once during my 3-night stay. The soap and shampoo dispensers were empty, trash cans full, and the beds were not made like they usually are. It was very empty, likely due to the increase in prices, and did not seem worth the price this time. Lockers were large, drinking water provided, beds very soft with privacy curtains.  The wellness desk was much more helpful this time, and accepted credit",50,44

"Had an expectation this place was going to be an amazing sanctuary filled with people who are loving, friendly, and as they love using ""mystical"" - they really fell short of this. When we checked in, the front desk staff have this confused attitude like why I am standing in front of them - we weren't really greeted and welcomed with smiles and beaming faces. Another worker gave us a tour and he seemed bored and as if someone had forced him to show up to work. They were helpful but the interactions were always awkward and done without smiles - like they are just going through the motions, doesn't really go with the yogi vibe and the rest of hotel's affirmations and theme. I agree with other reviewers as well the staff at the the Tierra restaurant are also not overly friendly, the",40,44
" food/menu is really great though - loved the vegetarian/vegan based. The pool area as well as the grounds are a bit run down. The room was very nice and spacious, great water pressure and hot water (although it was salty and I don't know why) . They made a huge deal on checking out pool towels which was not mentioned when checking in. They charge you 200 pesos for renting our their sh*t bikes, there's no hand breaks. You can't use your credit card to pay for any classes or bike rentals, however, you could use your cc it at the restaurant. They online website was very glitchy and you cannot reserve single yoga classes nor does the hotel guest discount apply online. The higher level management workers were more pleasant, all the yoga instructors were amazing - I enjoyed trying new classes, there was so much variety, like Kundilini, cacao ceremony and we did the Temazcal which was extraordinary! Meet some other hotel guests who were all very nice. Unfortunately, location wise was poor - it's much further to the downtown main streets and not really walkable (so sweaty) and the taxi drivers will use this broken bumpy non-road without lights if you want to go to the playa/hotelera zone area and it will break your back. I would recommend coming for the yoga classes but not to stay here.  ART WALK  - was nice they have a fire pit area BUT they did not have nightly fires, shame RECOMMEND TEMAZCAL experience",50,44

"A private king room in this hotel was not that much less than the 5* all inclusive we'd departed the day before and for such a basic room without even a phone or tea/coffee machine it was not worth the money.  The room was continually damp from the humidity of the jungle setting - towels didn't dry out, black mould grew in the bathroom and the bedding felt damp to sleep in, most unpleasant.  Housekeeping was hit and miss, for two days the room wasn't serviced at all, sometimes you'd get fresh towels or toilet roll, sometimes you didn't.  You'd then have to WhatsApp the front desk to ask for things like toilet roll and often that didn't turn up, or took 4 hours or more.  Yoga classes were removed from the schedule with a couple of hours' notice so three classes my partner planned",50,44

They called in taxis for us when we were at our restaurant and needed to get back to the hotel.

The next day, we asked the front desk person to change our room but were told that nothing was available (although we saw other people checking out).

We are currently at the hotel. It’s midnight and the music and bass from the club next door is literally shaking the walls. There is no way we can sleep or even think. Deeply regret booking here. The receptionist knew fully well that this music was going to be this loud at night time - it was playing during the day (which we weren’t too worried about as we were going to be out during the day) but she did not tell us it would go into the night.

You can see the beach and the sea without any people (most oft the time).  The cottages are nothing special but they are clean and provide everything you need. We used our cottage just to make breakfast, to sleep and to take a shower.  When you stay at such a great place you do not want to stay inside.  The whole staff is very friendly.

The pine trees sweep around back patios providing shade and and birds that sing throughout the day. There can’t be many beaches left with this kind of topographical landscape. There’s a bbq on the beach and a few small tables with straw umbrellas. We were lucky enough to enjoy a few quiet BBQ evenings with our Su Casa neighbours on the beach.

They have an cute pet that roams free but no more plot spoilers…  For your own supplies, try ‘Chedraui’ for excellent tomatoes, papayas, avocados and all else you can stock up on, including some great beachwear I wasn’t expecting to find.  We loved heading downtown to Javi’s, for low-key music and free-range food and the wonderful ‘A Mar’ for super-fresh and innovative Peruvian food.  But I digress: Marcus and his family live on-site as caretakers at Su Casa: nicer people you won’t easily find which includes Lupita herself.

Truly bizarre, especially considering you cannot charge room service or meals to your room—you settle up each and every time. And we had pre-paid for our room.  There is no hot water. You know those beautiful bath tubs in the pictures? You won’t use it because there isn’t any hot water. You will rush your showers because the water gets just a notch warmer than cold. Unbelievable for a place that bills itself as high end. The bath products are, well, meh.  The place is run down. The jets in",50,49
" our private splash pool on our balcony were broken. Stone tiles are falling off the side of the building. (I see another reviewer made that comments some time ago and it has not been corrected!)  Many other aspects of the place are run down—walls that need a paint job, wood that needs refinishing or tile that is mildewy or cracked.  The rooms are quite small—just big enough for a king-sized bed, the bath tub (which you won’t use unless you like cold baths) and a small side chair. The balcony is nice, but no room for a chair to sit on—you have to enjoy sitting in the cool splash pool water or sit on the steps you use to get into the cold splash pool.  Lots of positive reviews of the food, and it was indeed better than we expected from such a tiny place. Perhaps the one redeeming quality of the place.  There are so many better places available at this price and even at lower prices.  Do yourself a favor and go for one of those places!",50,49

"Stayed here for 3 days and each day kept getting better and better. We did have kind of a big inconvenience with electricity but Pedro made sure to make up for it even though it was 1 am haha, everything else was just perfect",50,49
"I booked this hotel accidentally, we checked in with no expectation, and after that the stay was amazing, facilities, all the personal there, the food (specially the food ) and the nature around..",50,49
"My wife and I were spending 7 years of marriage and it couldn't have been better. The service from Pedro, George and Leon was exceptional, if you have the luck of staying here make sure you look for these guys because they practically run Tulum The food was delicious, the facilities are incrediblhy beautiful.  I really loved everything about this vacation.",50,49
"As the title describes, my stay here was excellent! The food was absolutely delicious, I do think the service at the restaurant could be a bit better but to be honest everything else makes up for that. I was kinda hesitation on the location but after this I have no doubt this is the best spot in Tulum. It's not crowded, there is no traffic, no people on the beach or streets trying to sell you stuff, for me and my wife this is paradise.",50,49
"We have been to the Isla several times but this place is a piece of paradise...You walk in and it has a jungle feel to it. The walkway to the house is beautiful and so green, and the house is so nice and clean.  They had the A/C already on so the house wouldn't be hot.   The view from the balcony is amazing, and laying in the hammock was so relaxing.  You can also see the turtles and hermit crabs on the lagoon side.  The pool was refreshing after swimming in the ocean.  Adeymar was super helpful from the very beginning, and helped us until the very end.  He is super attentive and we enjoyed his company.  We just met and I can say we have made a friend with him and Adolfo.  We will definitely be returning here next time we come to Isla.",50,50
"We love to come to Isla and stay at Ikal.  We have stayed here twice!  Adeymar and Adolfo are the best hosts we have ever stayed with.  Adeymar is so helpful in helping us book things even outside the property.  He came along with us on our last adventure and took some great photos while we were on a whale shark tour!   He even helped us book a private chef to create a wonderful dinner on the rooftop patio. The property is spacious with a ground level pool and roof top dipping pool.  The chairs and hammock upstairs have a beautiful ocean view.  The beach across the street is amazing for seashell and sea glass hunting. We usually stay in the upstairs ocean view unit, and love it.  Come to Isla and let Adeymar take care of you, you won't regret it!",50,50
"This place was incredible.  It's a beautiful property with ocean views and so much privacy.  But you can find a lot of pretty places to stay.  The staff makes this place great.  Adeymar and Adolfo made the trip so easy to just enjoy ourselves.  They can arrange travel from the airport and dock, set up your daily trips, (we went to swim with whale sharks) the recommendation for local food was good.  We saw 3 sea turtles nesting on the beach the first night.  I can't believe the colors of blue in the wayer.  You won't regret chosing to stay here",50,50
"If you want a vacation in paradise where you don't have to plan or worry about anything stay at Ikal in Isla Mujeres. The hosts Adeymar and Adolfo are a breath of fresh air. The minute I booked the resort I was contacted by Adeymar. He is the sweetest, most energetic, full of life host you could ever hope for. He handled everything for me. I am the planner of the group and sometimes that takes away from the vacation because I am worrying about the details for everyone else. When you stay at Ikal the ocean views are stunning, the roof top deck is breath taking, and the rooms are even better than the photos. The best part of Ikal though is Adeymar! He contacted me once I booked the resort and learned about me and my group. He listened and then just took care of everything else and",50,50
" I mean everything; transportation, tours, restaurant recommendations, schedules. Any question I had before the trip or on the trip he was always available. The resort is worth every penny but the best part of Ikal is Adeymar. He is the best!",50,50
…,50,50
"Our stay at IKAL Garden was nothing short of magical. Private beach, personal hammock, rooftop views, and Adeymar who made us feel so welcome and supported. Island living at its best. Highly recommend!",50,50
"Adeimar and the crew were super nice and helpful. The place is both pastoral and neet. Super recommended. nice breakfast, very good wifi and air conditioning, great rooms and beds. Nice private pool at the rooftop with a nice view to the sea.",50,50
"This is really a great place to stay. Especially for 2 reasons: the host Adeymar - he is very friendly and helpful and secondly it’s not where everyone is, it’s at a quiet spot next to a laguna. The place is new and everything is handled really flexible. Adeymar even helped us to get groceries and showed us around. I can really recommend this place! ",50,50
"Die neue Architektenvilla liegt in bester Lage und ist so neu, dass die meisten Taxifahrer das Haus noch gar nicht kennen. Es ist unglaublich geschmackvoll eingerichtet und eingebettet in wunderbare Natur. Die Gastgeber sind wirklich bezaubernd - insbesondere die vielen kleinen zusätzlichen Goodies des Karismatischen Hosts aydemar  machten unseren aufenthalt einmalig.  Wir wurden zum Supermarkt gebracht - haben eine eigene Privat-Insel- Tour erhalten und abends einem Konzert mit Tequila gelauscht. Aydemar hat unseren Aufenthalt einzigartig gemacht - wir kommen gerne wieder ;) Die beiden Apartments in der Villa sind wahrhaftig ein Geheimtipp - den man eigentlich nicht verraten sollte um die  Exklusivität dieses Hauses zu bewahren;) Danke für diesen tollen Urlaub  ",50,50
"Stayed a full week with 3 other lades in Chuck and Sue's condo. It was perfect. Loved having access to a washing machine and dryer. The condo was roomy, with 2 king size beds and 2 full bathrooms. Nicely decorated and cool. The pools were clean but especially enjoyed the roof pool. We had it to ourselves. There is a large table and bar for taking snacks while enjoying the pool and sun. We were able to park our golf cart easily. Top notch host ... Thank you Chuck and Sue for sharing your wonderful home with us.",50,51
"My family of five stayed at 2201 condo, what an amazing view! The kitchen was exactly as pictured , pools always clean and inviting, it’s mid point on the island so I’d suggest a golf cart to get around the island . Many great restaurants. ( Oscar’s is amazing ) If u need to shop for groceries , it’s about 4 minutes away from main grocery store on island. If u plan to relax then this is the place.  Beds were great, internet is typical , on and off though the day. No main tv but had Netflix or amazon tv.   Thanks for a great trip!",40,51
"While this is a fairly new property, it showed serious signs of neglect during our recent visit there. Last Christmas, our condo was pristine, the complex was bustling with residents and visitors, and the restaurant downstairs served delicious food and had a vibrant happy hour. This Christmas, the condo felt abandoned--dusty, mildewy, with some problems like a lack of hot water in the showers, porch doors that wouldn't lock, and a beautiful stove featuring one working burner that we had to light with a match (yikes)--and the restaurant was permanently closed. We saw no other residents in the complex AT ALL during our stay, which indicates that the neglect in our unit might not be an isolated problem. Not sure what has happened here, but it seems like this place has run out of",30,51

"We have stayed in the penthouse and 2303. Both units owned by Dick and Julie. They are incredible, flawless, luxurious and some of the best accommodations you could ever ask for! I am tempted to always and only stay here for every trip! ",50,51
"We stayed for 6 nights in 2403 and couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. The location of Isla 33 is mid-island so it's an easy golf cart {or taxi ride} to either end. The condo's are newer and the grounds are nicely kept. There are three pools, two at ground level and one on the roof - which has an amazing view of the ocean and stairs that lead to a pavilion for a 360 view of the island. There is an elevator for those that can't manage stairs, or just to use for luggage. They also have covered parking for golf carts, which was really nice. There is security at the parking garage as well. The interior of our condo was nicely appointed and had pretty much everything you would need if you wanted to cook. This unit had two bedrooms, each with a king bed. The master had an en suite",40,51
" bathroom while the other bedroom had it's bathroom access next to the room. The kitchen was large and had a gas cooktop, oven, microwave, full size refrigerator as well as a wine fridge. There was a smart tv in the living room as well as both bedrooms, so if you have a netflix account you can easily log in and watch a movie. There were quite a few places to eat within walking distance, Madera Art & Food, El Rincon Cubano and others. Also several small store where you could get beer, water and sodas etc. Topaz is located on the property and we had several drinks there and ate breakfast there on our last morning. I realize that each property has different amenities, but overall this is a very nice property and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again or recommend it. The unit we stayed in was managed by Capi's Property  and they met us at the unit and went over the property with us.",50,51
…,40,51
"This was booked for us by a friend through Homeaway.  The property is managed by Capri's.  We were met on our arrival and given a tour of the condo and details explained.  We were given a map and recommendations for places to eat.  We booked a two room condo with a balcony off the master bedroom facing the ocean and a balcony off the second bedroom with views of the island and Cancun.  There were two bathrooms, one in the master bedroom and one just outside the second bedroom.  The condo was spotless and the air conditioning worked perfectly.  There is a large kitchen with everything you need to cook if you so desire.  We did very little cooking due to the large variety of great restaurants on the island, many within walking distance.  A couple things to know.  This is located",40,51
"Nice room, beautiful view, but very poorly run. Took us an hour to get ahold of the front desk to let us in (because they keep the door locked) and they didn't have a key for us to get in the building. Ended up having to climb the balcony to get into our room on more than 1 occasion. We were also charged extra at check out because our towels were dirty.. would not recommend to anyone young and even slightly active or adventurous ",20,52
"We booked this place through booking.com and it was one of a handful bookings during our journey where we felt the presentation did not match our experience. We expected a kind of ""boutique"" hotel, but it's not, it's just a quite basic place by (and owned by) the adjacent church.  When we arrived after a very long journey the hotel was locked and the reception empty. Panic! We found a very helpful shop owner who could call staff an his mobile (we couldn't find any usable network at all), and after 20 minutes they arrived, and blamed us for being too late. We had estimated an arrival time at 10pm and arrived an hour later. We had no idea the reception closed so early. We were given a very simplistic room on the third floor (no elevator), next to a large terrace with great views",20,52
" of the sea. But on the second day we had to leave that room in a hurry after torrential rain transformed the terrace to a pond and water began pouring into the room.  So we got another room, and a much classier one with a safe, a sofa, a table and a refrigerator. The previous room had none of these things, so this one felt much more like what we had expected initially.  The breakfast was good, the location was ok even if it's quite some distance away from Playa Norte, the ferry terminal and the shopping streets.",10,52
…,50,52
"I booked to this hotel through booking.com based on the amazing views it has,and the reviews.. no beach however. I requested room 7 in a message to the property.The place is part of a catholic church right next to it. The guy at the reception had no idea of my booking. I showed a copy on my phone to him  ..then he couldn't find the keys for the room. It appears someone asignates the rooms based on how much they pay! So if you book for a day you will have a view to the concrete wall next to the building. I went and look at the room and they were very basic. Beds were hard. I was waiting for my room for 55 mins! No luck. Nice views if you run with the holly spirit. At the end of the day I found a better hotel with amazing views and better attitude and parking. Very unpleasant",50,52
 experience. Avoid this place!,40,52
…,50,52
"This is an incredibly good value place to stay. Order a sea view room as the small amount of extra is well worth it for the stunning views. We had a very large terrace overlooking the sea. Taxis are so cheap that the out of town location is no issue and hiring a golf buggy for the day to explore is a must. The breakfast was nice and again, you could sit outside on the stunning terrace and watch the sea and visiting iguanas. Well worth visiting this island and if you do, this is a great place to stay.",50,52
"It was our first night in Mexico and we were blown away. After parking our car and walking by the church that showed an amazing ocean view, we were instantly captivated. Neither my boyfriend or I are religious, but we certainly felt a spiritual awakening being here amidst the beauty. The location was great, easily walkable and we felt safe the entire time.     Our room was lovely, the blue decor accentuated the fantastic views of the ocean. For the price we paid, we felt like we got an amazing deal. The features of the room were simple and cozy, met our basic needs. The breakfast in the morning was yummy, again accompanied by beautiful views. After breakfast, we went down and explored the beach further.   Would definitely recommend Casa Cural, it was a bargain and unforgettable",50,52

We switched hotels after having a bad experience with another. What a treat! Edson texted us upon reservation and had our room ready very quickly. Adorable garden and quaint little room with amenities such as water available. Lovely little breakfast. ,50,53
"We were very disappointed in our say at Maya Casitas.  We have stayed at several B&Bs and had high hopes.  For the price we paid, we should have received better accommodations.  We could have stayed at a nicer hotel and paid separately for breakfast and spent less.  We would not recommend unless the price is $50 US per night or less.  Pros •	Inn keepers were very nice. •	The room was clean when we arrived.  Cons •	The air conditioning was off when we arrived, so the room was sweltering.  We had to leave for several hours just to let the air conditioning get the room down to a bearable temp. •	They call themselves a B&B.  We have stayed at many B&Bs, and one of the best parts is the breakfast.  The breakfast here was more of a continental breakfast.  Juice, coffee, a croissant,",20,53
" yogurt, and some fruit.  No protein and nothing was cooked.  Oh, and the breakfast was the exact same every morning.  When we found this out on the first morning, we skipped the other mornings. •	There was NO daily service.  The room was not cleaned, towels were not changed, trash was not taken out.   •	We ran out of toilet paper because there was no daily service. •	The room needed repair.  There were missing tiles, cracks, and missing plaster. •	The door to the room is glass.  There was a crack that went the entire horizontal length of the door, and I was worried that it would shatter just from normal use. •	The air conditioning unit dripped condensation in the room.  The floor is tile, so there were puddles on the floor, making it very slippery and a definite fall hazard.",50,53

"I am generally a solo traveling woman & have been to the Isla several times for weeks at a time & I have stayed in a very expensive all inclusive prior to staying at Maya Casitas & I must say, I will never stay anywhere but here. The best price a few feet away from all the restaurants, bars, and shops in the Centro & just 5 mins away from the ever gorgeous Playa Norte & you can run along the sea wall just a 1 minute walk from the b&b!!  This trip was just 5 days & I brought a friend that hadn’t ever traveled outside of the states. We stayed in the room with twin beds that had a fabulous ambiance with a refrigerator, washroom, sink, roomy shower, a safe, and comfortable beds. There was a gigantic TV with Netflix & WiFi was fabulous & beneficial to make phone calls. There were",50,53
" books in the room & outlets beside the beds. The a/c was flawless! The entire property was simply spotless and beautiful.  There is a courtyard patio with beautiful tropical plants and inviting and quaint seating for all guests. Edson & Fausto were absolutely charming and hospitable! Upon arrival I found bottled water in the room and was immediately offered a glass of water or juice. I was even offered to have pasta with them! So very kind!  I spent 5 days at Maya Casitas which is located in the Centro truly in the BEST location possible. I woke in the mornings to run on the beach and watch the sunrise & the b&b was immaculate at all times. Edson also kindly provided a bottle of wine which I enjoyed with new friends I met while on the Isla.   I booked the stay online and paid the morning before I left. I also asked for Edson to help me with getting low rates for private fishing, snorkeling/MUSA, whale shark tour, & the Mayan Ruins. What a deal!! I used Isla Mujeres Trips which is around the corner on Hidalgo and run by two sisters.   Edson was truly a fantastic host as he suggested some places to eat and provided a price range for each.   There is a bar across the street and down a shop that does play live music which is darling and it’s not an issue when it’s time to sleep.   I always feel very safe on the Isla and especially so at Maya Casitas. I will absolutely be back with my girlfriends and solo again & look forward to staying with Edson & Fausto!   In the mornings, Mariana makes coffee, cuts up the fruit, and sets up breakfast for all the travelers. She is ever so kind and sweet.   Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about my stay as I’m pretty familiar with the island.   Edson, Fausto, & Mariana- thank you so much for the lovely experience, friendship, kindness, and look out in the mail! I’m sending you a bowl to replace the one I accidentally broke! Oops! All my love from Oklahoma   I can not wait to bring my girlfriends to enjoy the paradise of your b&b you shared with me! ",50,53

"We absolutely loved staying at Maya Casitas! The rooms were perfectly clean and adorable right in the center of town. The real plus was the attention to details. The hosts cared about each host to make your experience personalized. From getting your coffee order the night before, to booking all our tours and reservations (with a discount!) I would never stay anywhere else in Isla Mujeres.",50,53
"I stayed at Maya Casitas towards the end of a 3 week trip around the Yucatan peninsula, and it was without a doubt my favorite place I stayed at. I immediately wanted to extend my stay. The room was gorgeous and pristinely clean. There was a giant tv with built in Netflix. WiFi was excellent. Not only did we have our own fridge and table, there is also a little common area that has tables and is like a secluded seating garden. There were 2 employees who welcomed us with open arms and gave us great advice about isla mujeres and booked our whale shark tour for us (side note, Ceviche Tours did an excellent job our Whale shark tour!)

Love the Isla!!! Gracias Chac chi!!! ",50,54

We stayed for 2 nights before moving to our rental.  Nice and clean and good location.  Beds just a little too firm for me.  Roof top pool had a very nice view.  Continental breakfast was nice.  Other than that enjoyed our stay,40,54
"The rooms are modest and very comfortable with all the amenities, a/c, microwave, small refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster, TV. The first floor pool and roof pools are refreshing and clean. The staff is the best, speak very good English, knowledgable about the Island, and always helpful. The location is excellent, out of the commotion of downtown, yet delicious restaurants are near by and while the taxi fare is very cheap, it's an easy walk to downtown (without heavy suitcases). We have enjoyed staying here many times.",50,54
"I stayed in room 17. There was two windows one faced the hallway and the other faced another window. So I couldn't open any of them. There was an open fuse box in my room with the wires exposed. The wifi was spotty at best. The password was changed two days in, I was never notified. Another guest told me about it. The breakfast was minimal even for a continental breakfast it was lacking. The roof is the best part of the hotel. The bathroom floor had two big holes next to the toilet and the curtain rod was rusted.",20,54
"Amazing, we had a kitchenette with the bedroom which had one queen size bed with a twin bed.  The staff is wonderful and so helpful. My husband and I speak little Spanish but the staff spoke English very well and always was so helpful.  The rooms were very clean, air conditioner worked well, pool on the roof was so great and the view incredible at nighttime.  We hope to stay here again next year.  2 Blocks West is a Dive Shop called Casa Del Buceo which is the best of the best. We truly are so blessed to meet friends that we met last year on the island and now we made more friends and can't wait to go back again.",50,54
"The rooms are modest, a/c worked well. Bed was a little hard to us. Staff was helpful and always there. We never ate the breakfast - just cereal or toast. Several places within walking distance that served food. It's a little far from downtown but taxi ride is about 50 pesos. Room had a microwave, small refrigerator, coffee maker, and toaster with a very few dishes. The view from the roof is outstanding. Pools were well maintained. Last day work was going on in one room during the day which was a little irritating but if I were here I might stay here again or possibly downtown hotel.",40,54

The kitchen had things we needed such as bottle openers, pots, dish towels, koozies, etc. It was quiet and extremely relaxing. The property as a whole is wonderful. The pool is huge and we felt like we had it to ourselves the whole time. The hot tub was so nice to use at the end of the day as things were cooling off. We swam off the private dock. The lounge chairs were clean and one day one of the staff members even came to",50,55

It was such a treat. Golf cart parking was extremely easy and there is even a box of books by the front desk for guests to borrow for beach reads. The owners of the condo left maps in the kitchen for us to use, which we found very helpful when navigating the island.  Overall, our experiences at Puerta al Mar was exceeded all of our expectations. We couldn't of been more happy with our stay and are so excited to come back one day!!!",50,55

She worked out a great deal for golf carts for us, which were waiting for us at the condo. She was also there to great us. This being our second trip this year to Isla, we like the south end a bit more. Very quiet, beach not so great and of course the views are just fantastic. We loved how big the pool is. The condo was big enough for my in laws, my mother, husband and I. I highly recommend staying here, if your looking to get away and want quiet time just to relax.

Only one drawback...big sports bar with live music (we had 3 nights of it) and a huge outdoor TV right outside the patio..  Pretty loud until about midnight.  Would work for you if you hit the bars anyway!",50,56

Forniscono gli asciugamani per il mare e le sedie per la spiaggia libera. Lo staff è gentile, disponibile e simpatico, ci si sente come a casa sin da subito!

Lo staff è gentile, preparato, disponibile e",50,56
" simpaticissimo. L'attrezzatura è in ordine, tenuta bene e credo nuova. I siti di immersione sono stupendi, se ci si immerge due volte nello stesso punto saranno due esperienze completamente diverse.  Ringraziamo tutti per il soggiorno e per le immersioni, ma un particolare grazie va a Ivan (nostro istruttore nel corso AOW) ed a Manu che ci ha scovato, nell'ultima immersione, il raro ed endemico ""Splendid Toadfish Cozumel"".  We stayed at Sea Hawk Diving and we also did the Padi Advance Open Water course and several dives with them. The structure is well maintained, a few steps from the sea (playa northe) and the rooms are large and clean, tidy and equipped with all comforts (air conditioning, fan, fridge, toaster, American coffee maker, crockery and 20  liters of water available).  They provide towels for the beach and chairs for the free beach.  The staff is kind, helpful and friendly, you feel right at home right away!  As for diving, they are simply the TOP!  I don't think we can ask for better.  Once you have made your first dive you will immediately want to do more.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and very nice.  The equipment is in order, well kept and I think new.  The dive sites are great, if you dive twice in the same place they will be two completely different experiences.  We thank everyone for the stay and for the dives, but a special thanks goes to Ivan (our instructor during the AOW course) and to Manu who, on the last dive, has found us the rare and endemic ""Splendid Toadfish Cozumel"".",50,56

"These guys are great! Local to me is always better! Owners are hands on and love what they do! They were kind and took great care of a friend that got sea sick while we kept snorkeling with the Whale Sharks. Got our moneys worth on this excursion!   We did the dive the first day, The master diver guide Manu was great and gave us an awesome dive!   Everyone is friendly! I will Be back and stay on the island and dive with them again!  We came in form Cancún and wish we would have stayed on the island the whole time!   Thanks for everything!!!",50,56
"10 minute walk from the ferry - close to beautiful Playa Norte but on a more quiet street this little gem was perfectly positioned and perfectly formed.  Owners and staff are really friendly and helpful, the accommodation (up a flight of stairs) was clean and had everything we needed for a perfect stop over of 4 nights. Our room (no.5) is at the rear of the building with its own private outdoor living area - beautifully set up with comfortable lounge furniture and hammock- the interior is well apportioned (fab bed) good shower room and basic kitchen - (a fridge/freezer, coffee maker, 2 plate hob, microwave and toaster oven).  There is also a roof terrace! We loved it and would definitely return.",50,56
I had not dove in several years. Manuel did a great job getting my neutral buoyancy back up to speed. The Sea Hawk's Discover Scuba package was excellent as well. Now my son wants to get certified. I will definitely book more trips!,50,56
"We really liked this place.  The staff is great and the return to is awesome and pretty much the same prices you will find around the island.  I loved the pool and the view.  No swimming in the ocean though.  My only criticism is that it would have been nice to have a door on our bathroom and some of the sheets had stains, which I wasn’t crazy about.  It is a good deal for the price you pay. The margaritas are strong FYI!",50,57

"This place was absolutely perfect for the kind of stay we wanted on Isla. It’s a 5 minute or $2.50 taxi ride from downtown, or the north side of the Island, But just out of the hustle and bustle. It sits on the east coast of the island and has access to a beautiful rocky beach. A double terraced patio and restaurant along with a pool overlook the sea. The food in the restaurant was ah-mazing! And the staff are really friendly. Most of the island’s beaches are naturally rocky, with the only sandy beaches being small and in distinct locations. But the island is so tiny that a can ride to any beach will be less than $5. The A/C was wonderful, and the room included yoga mats which we used to sit on the beach. They do yoga classes here as well. We had a very simple room with no TV,",50,57

"We have been to Isla Mujeres 8 times over the past 10 years and this is our least favorite of all of the rentals we have stayed in. We chose the property for the location on the island. We love to be on the Caribbean side of the island on the airport strip for the views (knowing that we can't swim there). This area of the island is away from the majority of restaurants and swimmable beaches, but we like to stay in a quieter area of the island. We rent golf carts to go into town or to the beach clubs at the south end of the island. I cannot speak for the restaurant; we didn't eat there. The ants in our room did not make me want to try the restaurant. So I can't speak for the food. We stayed in the abundance suite with 3 adults and 1 child. The size was okay for our group.",50,57

" However, the pictures on the website do not represent the room or the pool area at all. The rooms may have looked as serene and clean as seen on the website at one time, but that is no longer the case! It was somewhat strange that the shower was not in the bathroom and instead was in the kitchen. The glass had been partially frosted but anyone using the shower could still be seen in the living room and kitchen. We could get past that. The water was cold for the first two days (not tolerable to shower). The water did warm up as the week went on. There were ants and mouse droppings in the kitchen when we entered the first day. We told the staff and they sprayed something in the kitchen but the ant problem continued to worsen thru out the week. Also, The sliding door in the living room had a very big gap and would let air in and out. Housekeeping came daily but always seemed to do the minimum. The sheets did not seem to be changed all week and the hand towel in the bathroom and the towel to step onto when getting out of the shower were not changed all week despite being visibly dirty. Yes, there was a basket to put towels that needed cleaning and replacing but I would think a visibly dirty hand towel would get changed without asking. We realized we were out of water one evening when getting back from dinner. There was no one to ask, since the staff leaves at 5. Again, I would expect that the cleaning staff would notice the low water and leave another jug or there would be another jug stored somewhere in the room (like all of the previous rentals we have stayed in). We asked in the morning for more water and came home that evening to a 1/3 full jug of water. Of course, with 4 people, the jug was gone by the next morning and we had to ask again. Luckily they gave us a full jug the next day. The last day of our trip was the most frustrating. Trying to pack in every bit of the island we could, we came home from a day exploring feeling dirty and sticky and ready to shower. But there were no towels. We had even asked that morning to make sure they were replaced, but we arrived home after office hours to no towels. The sign on the door states that staff in the restaurant can help if there is a need after hours. However, when we spoke to the staff, they said there was nothing they could do to get us towels.

We stayed in the Harmony room which had a beautiful ocean view, although we couldn’t really keep the curtains open to appreciate the view because anybody using the pool was just a couple of meters away and could see right in.  The hotel isn’t central so you always have to get a taxi to the center, but they are easy enough to get and cheap. The room was always kept clean, but it was quite small and cramped.  The staff were friendly and helpful, although the reception is only open from 9-5 each day. There is a restaurant upstairs (Da Luisa) which was nice for breakfast, but closed on a Monday.

"I have been coming to Isla Mujeres for 15 years and have stayed in many places on the island.  While Casa Ixchel is clean and the staff seems to be very personable, in my opinion, there are much nicer places to stay on the island for the price they charge.   We had the one-bedroom suite, Abundance, on the first floor. The pictures on the website show a bright room with white curtains, a glass table and 4 chairs, and a toaster oven in the kitchen.  It looked really cute and charming and we were excited to go there.  What we found, however, was that the pictures were misleading.

" down a narrow hallway that was very dark at night as several of the bulbs were burnt out in the outside sconces.  The bedroom, kitchen and bathroom windows all open up to the hallway so there is no natural light coming in those windows.  The only natural light in the apartment comes from the sliding glass doors that open to the patio and swimming pool.  When you open the doors you have a spectacular view of the patio, pool and the ocean and you can’t help but love hearing the sounds of the waves crashing against the rocks.  That’s the part we loved!  Our disappointment came quickly as we opened the curtains to see someone sitting outside on one of the chairs.  Our patio was not private and was open to all who are staying there.  All of the curtains in the apartment are a heavy, dark blue color that makes the rooms look dark and dreary, not bright and cheery like the pictures.  The curtains even have Velcro on the edges to hold them together (pretty tacky).  If you want privacy, you have to keep the curtains closed as anyone in the complex can see in your apartment if they are using the pool or just sitting outside on one of the tables or chairs.  So our love of being able to look out at the pool and ocean from our room was severely hampered by our wanting to have some privacy.  The sliding glass doors were also missing a handle and did not lock so you had to lay down sticks between the door and the wall to make sure that no one could come in while you were gone.  The apartment itself has an interesting layout.  As you enter through the main door, to the left is the kitchen, a huge walk-in shower, linen closet, powder room and bedroom. To the right is the living area with a couch and loveseat (no end tables, lamps or coffee table) and then a full size Murphy bed right in front of the sliding glass doors that open to the patio and pool.  If you don’t need the Murphy bed, it can’t be put up to get it out of the way; you just have to walk around it.  The bedroom has a large king bed and two large closets with shelves in between to lay out your clothes.  The bedroom is so poorly lit with only two sconces that, at night, it was hard to see what you were looking for, and you certainly couldn’t read in bed as there were no end tables or lamps.  Because the bedroom was so dark and dreary, we slept on the Murphy bed with the glass doors open (and curtains shut) so we could hear the waves crashing at night.  While we loved hearing the sound of the ocean, the bed was not comfortable and it probably wasn’t safe to leave the doors open and unlocked while we slept.    The bathroom, which was outside the bedroom, had only a wall sink and a toilet.  There were no hooks or shelves to place your toiletries so you had to keep toiletry items on the table outside of the bathroom, which was very inconvenient.  The dim lighting (a sconce) made it hard to put on make-up or even shave. There was a linen closet between the bathroom and the huge walk-in shower that had a very small but secure safe for you to put valuables in.  The walk-in shower was nice, BUT!!, there was a glass window (half frosted) between the shower and the kitchen.  Yes, I said a glass window!  If I was standing in the kitchen or living area and my husband was in the shower, I could see him taking his shower.  And the water was anything but hot.  The first two days I took cold showers and later discovered that if you let the water run for a good 3-4 minutes and don’t mess with the 2 lower faucets, the water would get lukewarm.   Be prepared!  The round glass table in the picture was replaced with a square, beaten up wooden table (the same kind that they use in the restaurant above) with a tablecloth on top. Sparsely equipped is an overstatement for the kitchenette. There was one large pot, one frying pan, a coffee pot, a blender, limited utensils, no toaster or toaster oven and no microwave.  So if you want to cook or bring something back from one of the wonderful restaurants, you have nothing to warm food up in.  There is a propane stove, but you need matches to light it and we were hesitant to do that. There is no television, no clock or radio, no puzzles or anything to entertain yourself on a rainy day so bring your entertainment with you.  While some of the other rooms/apartments in the complex have secure Internet, the connection in our room was NOT secure which was quite burdensome as I would disconnect after checking email, etc.    There are no comfortable outside chairs to sit on and no umbrellas or shade to sit in if you just want a cool spot to read a book by the pool.  There are only sun beds to lay on which are good for tanning, but not for reading.   It wouldn’t take a whole lot to make this complex more appealing. It has breathtaking views of the ocean and you can’t beat the sound of the waves crashing outside your door.  Adding a couple of end tables and lamps in the bedrooms and living area would provide some charm and badly needed lighting.  Replacing those hideous dark blue curtains with something lighter would brighten the room up. Putting a toaster oven or a microwave in the kitchen to heat things up would be appreciated.  Equipping the kitchen with enough dishes, utensils, glasses, pots and pans (for 4) would make the kitchen usable.  Adding a couple of lounge chairs (not beds) outside to sit in and a few umbrellas would make it comfortable for those who want to relax outside but not sit in the sun.  Replacing burnt out bulbs and fixing broken doors would make it feel safer.",40,57

This property was exactly as we expected from the research we did. It was clean and cleaned daily very well. The traffic noise from the main road was audible but nothing that disturbed our sleep. We didn’t cook in the room but it had some basics if you can prepare a meal with only a microwave. The umbrellas on the truly stunning back porch need replacement/repair. The dipping pool was a nice treat any time of day. The tv is a smart tv but we had trouble getting it to log into Netflix and were unable to get English subtitles to work. The mini fridge takes a long time to get ice to freeze so making drinks in the room was a bit difficult. I brought a blackout curtain for the front window based on another users review and that was very helpful since it is a sheer white curtain with,50,58

I have mixed reviews for Casa Bonita.  Although I loved our stay on isla mujeres and I enjoyed our stay at casa Bonita I believed it was lacking in many areas.  I doh t I would return.  The people were absolutely delightful despite the language barrier.  We stayed in the penthouse and it was perfect for the 4 adults and 3 children.  Lots of space.  But The terrace that could have been so perfect had they provided decent furniture was very disappointing to have a bunch or ratty old kitchen chairs and a table. I had hopes to spend lots of time on the terrace but really didn’t at all.   I had expected there would be at least a chaise lounge or two and maybe some comfortable seating so we could enjoy the beautiful terrace and view.  The view was incredible.   The pool yard also,30,59

The propert itself is huge and the outdoor kitchen worked great for two nights of catered dinners by Javis cantina (also 5 stars and highly recommended  if you have a large group at casa bonita).  We loved our stay and will be back!",50,59
"We rented the house, there was 8 in our group. First of all, our flights were 10 hrs delayed, we were unable to communicate with Lisa as we were on a flight. Our wedding party of 4 Guests were also delayed, Lisa was very unhelpful and had NO compassion for our situation. Our guests were late getting in, and noone was there to meet them at the house.  We never made the ferry, and ended up having to stay the night in Cancun. All Lisa was concerned about was getting her final payment, in which she insisted we be at the property for 8:00 AM, even though we did not get to our hotel in Cancun until 2:00AM. The property was beautiful and the staff kept it very clean! Once Lisa got her money we never saw her again. There is an outdoor kitchen that comes with the house, we were charged",50,59
" 600.00$USD for the use of this outdoor kitchen that is supposed to be with the house. The house accommodates 14 people, there was exactly 14 ppl at our little ceremony. We were charged the 600.00$ for supposingly liquor license . We never saw a license posted once. And I am pretty sure a license does not cost 600.00$USD. Once our numbers changed for the wedding we found Lisa very unhelpful and at times snotty. She took it personally, this was not her day, and she was not empathetic AT ALL. We were allowed 14ppl at the event, anything over 14 ppl is an extra 20.00$ USD, so it may hold 50 ppl, but it will cost 20.00$USD per person.  On top of the $600.00USD , for the outdoor kitchen area that comes with the house anyway. We also paid $950.00 USD per night for the house. Noone showed us around and Lisa just took her money and ran never to be seen for the rest of our stay.  It makes me wonder how much the owner actually knows??  Casa Bonita is beautiful, but I would not stay there again because of Lisa Clemmons, nor will I recommend it to anyone.",50,59
…,50,59
"This was our second stay at Casa Bonita and we will be back many more times!  Not your typical hotel or bnb, Casa Bonita is like staying at a family property where the staff know your name and treat you like one of their own.  Thank you to the Garza family for their hospitality and thank you to Lisa Clemens for all that she does to make your stay on Isla perfect!",50,59
"We stayed 4 days at the penthouse with our family of 10 and had a wonderful time. The penthouse is large enough for 5 adults 3 teenagers and a twin of 8. We enjoyed the gorgeous views from the terrace, the pool and the private little beach.  The owners are wonderful and it was the perfect stay for our family. We would love to come again!",50,59
"Our family of 5 had a great time in Isla!  Part of that was due to the absolutely amazing manager Lisa!  She was super helpful in all aspects of our vacation!  Casa Bonita is closer to the south end of the island so I would recommend a golf cart for your stay.  Lisa helped us procure one on our first day, that we kept for the week.  The beach is very small at this location but we still enjoyed it!  There are many nearby beaches to enjoy - just ask!  I highly recommend Isla for a family friendly vacation.  My kids had a great time, and so did we!",50,59
"NEST Tulum was a dream come true for my new wife and I on our honeymoon. Nestled on a quiet, private beach, NEST is a small adults-only hotel that blends into the jungle with a focus on eco-conscious tourism. Everything about NEST was impeccable. Our room had a private balcony overlooking the ocean. The food was incredible - we ate breakfast and lunch there every day because why mess with a great thing? The location is right in the heart of Tulum Beach, within walking distance of countless amazing restaurants and boutiques. They'll also let you check out bikes if you want to cruise a little further. And a special shout out to the concierge, who are super responsive on WhatsApp and helped us with everything from calling taxis to arranging our COVID test to helping us secure a",50,60

"Wonderful view from jungle to the vast view of the Caribbean Sea.  Cosy and stylish jungle rooms with incredible views.  Very nicely orchestrated by Cynthia and the team, polite, supportive and helpful.",50,60
"Absolutely will be returning to Nest Tulum! My boyfriend and I had the most incredible experience here - it is paradise. Exceptional attention to detail, service, food, and accommodations. It is such an intimate and breathtaking environment and a perfect sliver of peace in the heart of Tulum beach. Hotel staff were incredibly kind and gave us a room upgrade, multiple surprise gifts as we were celebrating a birthday, and enabled late checkout. Already planning next trip back.",50,60
"We had two amazing days at NEST! If we knew how amazing an experience it would be, we would have stayed longer. The staff were so pleasant and helpful. The restaurant and the beach area are so beautiful. The food was amazing, especially the complimentary breakfast which exceeded all our expectations. We can’t wait to go back here in the future!",50,60
"I took this solo trip as a healing and recovery opportunity. 10 months ago I had been diagnosed with cancer. When I was feeling like absolute hell in the days following chemotherapy… when even drinking water was painful… when I was totally sick, I would visualize myself healthy, happy and in a gorgeous beach in Tulum. As soon as the doctors said I was finally ok, I booked the trip and found Nest… Everyone at Nest was so kind… no one knew what I had gone through, yet they all were all kind and welcoming and I felt like being home. I cannot wait for the opportunity to return and continue to enjoy the beauty of this place.",50,60
"This place was amazing! Everything you needed, you didn’t even need to leave. I love that it was further south, way less busy and so quiet and peaceful. The staff where kind and so helpful. I would 100% stay here again. Highly recommend.",50,60
"We had our wedding at The Nest and our reception on Nu.  We purchased all the rooms at The Nest for our family and friends and the staff couldn't have been more attentive.  They made my elderly parents feel right at home and took such great care of our closest friends and family.  All of guests said this was the best wedding they have ever been too.  The food was to die for!   The rooms are great, very Tulum.  Wild is a sister restaurant we are at, and the food was out of this world delicious!  I thank the staff from the bottom of my heart for what they provided for my family and friends.  Highly, highly recommend!!",50,60
"This is a perfect, peaceful getaway in Tulum! A small boutique hotel (only 13 rooms) with amazing facilities. The beds are super comfortable, shower is perfect, beach beds are everything you need, breakfast (and all other food) delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Location is also perfect! Almost everything on walking distance, and otherwise you can use their bikes for free. Don’t skip a facial/massage!!",50,60
"I loved everything about Latino Boutique Hotel and my room, and it is definitely the best hotel for the money that I have ever stayed in. I planned a last-minute solo trip and booked this hotel during my layover with no research and I was blown away. The location is perfect - just one street back from the main drag tucked away in a residential area with restaurants and cute spots, easily walkable to everywhere in Tulum Pueblo.  It's quiet and peaceful, and the hotel itself has quiet hours. There's some minor street noise and music, but it's just a hum, barely noticeable inside, and you're going to have that everywhere in town. The hotel common spaces are so clean and thoughtfully decorated. The staff are genuine, friendly, and just fantastic, and I was happy to see and get to",50,61
" know them over my stay - shoutout to Janeth and Lucia. When my shower head needed tweaked, they fixed it in on the spot and when I had some bug bites, they offered me cream. Each of the 13 rooms was named after a fruit. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to Toronja (Grapefruit), the penthouse, with a king bed, double sinks, and balcony with a soaking tub and hammock. I saw other rooms that were equally cute and well thought out. They really think of everything - double window shades, ceiling fan, great A/C - so you can adjust light and temperature to your preference. There was wonderful cleaning service daily (thanks Maria!) that came when I was out and I always returned to a neatly made sheets, fresh towels, and refilled water next to the bed. I also loved the free fresh coffee in the mornings and the kitchenette and mini fridge in the common space. Tulum feels safe and secure, but they also have friendly 24/7 security (hi Don Carlos!) to greet you when you return at night. I could have spent my entire trip lounging in the hotel and been perfectly content. OH, and they have two friendly, adorable rescue cats Tino and Catalina who hang out and like to visit.",50,61
…,50,61
"We booked 2 nights, but decided to stay 6 more nights :) Very cozy little hotel.  Very very helpful people in front desk, thank you all so much for helping us with everything! Good wifi! Nice little cleaned pool. Free coffee and hot water in the mornings. Lounge area with microwave, ice machine and oven. If you book smaller room and have no fridge, you can use the fridge in the lounge area. In family room we had a kitchenette with very nice fridge and coffee machine etc. Overall - we stayed in much more expensive hotels in Tulum, but Latino Boutique hotel was a rare find and very good value for the money. It is in very central place, few meters to everything. Recommend and will be back, while in Tulum!",50,61
We came to Tulum with no reservation and literally found the area we wanted to be in and accidentally stumbled upon this delightful boutique.  It was renovated in 2020 and is exquisite. Expect some noise from neighboring streets but the hotel itself is gorgeous. Every room is completely unique and themed after a tropical fruit...ours was passion fruit. Gorgeous murals in the rooms and courtyard...every detail is thought through. Courtyard is beautiful and cozy. Good wifi and staff treated us like we were family.  There are only 13 rooms so you get a quiet homey experience. ,50,61
"Loved this hotel. Helpful front desk staff, relaxing courtyard, cute small pool, small communal kitchen. Get a second floor room with hammock and patio. Hot water is good, takes a few minutes to warm up. Our room was cream colored and simply but elegantly furnished. In the heart of Tulum, steps from the main boardwalk.  One tip: if you arrive in the evening, come via the main road in Tulum, 307. When we were there, numerous side roads had construction under way. Piles of rubble, giant potholes, motorcycles, and roaming street dogs made for the most harrowing driving we experieced in Mexico. Come during the daylight. If you are using google maps, search for La Gloria de Don Pepe, the restaurant up the street, to avoid numerous detours. The hotel is on a one way street that is",50,61

"The resort is on a quiet part of the beach, and the surroundings are gorgeous.  The staff was well-prepared and attentive during our entire stay.  They provided us with suggestions for tours and restaurants in the area and kept the room stocked with potable water.  We will definitely return and stay at this wonderful resort!",50,62
"My wife and I spent 7 days in Tulum at the Sanara!  Fantastic accommodations, super clean & comfortable rooms, courteous & friendly staff.  We enjoyed the restaurant The Real Coconut and the Spa as well.  Our concierge Bryan did a fantastic job of lining up dive trips for us and Covid testing.  Would highly recommend Sanara it truly lived up to its reviews!!",50,62
"Had a fantastic time and great location ,however after paying a lot for the accommodation and always tipping the restaurant staff when we had breakfast and lunch ( food was lovely ) and paying for hotel bikes and the normal taxes they stuck another 921 dollars on bill ( optional) after giving you the bill for gratuity for the hotel staff !! Left a bad taste as always paid the service for everything we already had ! Watch out for this additional cost !!",40,62
"Wow, this place is amazing and beautiful. The staff bent over backwards to make sure we were accommodated. We explained to Letty what we had in mind and she organized the whole thing, so easy. We saw ruins, monkeys and a locals only cenote. The spa great,  I had the best message of my life and you can’t beat doing yoga with the beautiful  ocean right in our face. The hotel has day beds reserved for the guests on the beach. Definitely want to come back and stay again.",50,62
"We loved everything about our experience at Sanara.  My daughter and I had such a wonderful and relaxing vacation.  We didn't leave the Sanara oasis except to take Long Beach walks.  Everyone was accommodating, cheerful and helpful.  The restaurant ""the real coconut"" was fabulous and healthy.  We still managed to over indulge.  But hey, it was vacation!  Our Villa was simple, clean and well appointed.  We loved the private patio in the rear with a hammock, table for two and a claw foot tub.  Which I used every day.  The yoga studio was so wonderful with the doors open and a fabulous view of the ocean.  The beach beds and staff were the best. The wellness spa was incredible.  We enjoyed many of the daily offerings of sound healing, astrology and Ayurveda traditions. I can't wait",50,62
 to go back.,10,62
…,50,62
"The worst service of the complete town, they removed me from my table because I was 1 person with m baby consuming versus family of four, even thought my husband was going to consume after his yoga lesson. It’s a complete contradiction their concept of wellness when they prove they only care for making big tickets. A shame! Wellness is to embrace in all the aspects and not only a marketing concept",50,62

"We had shifted from hotel Alaya which is just a 2 minute walk from Sanara. Alaya turned out to be a real dump even though it is rated no. 4 on TA. Sanara deserves to be number 1. The rooms are excellent, we had a two bedroom suite and it was very comfortable, relaxing and quiet. The beach access is great. The yoga classes were amazing. My wife is vegan so she loved the on site restaurant - Real Coconut. This is a great place to stay in Tulum right close to all the nice restaurants. The service is excellent. Not sure why it is rated 36 in TA. It deserves to be number 1, planning to be abck in December again.",50,62
"Group of 13 guided by Roly who masterfully mixed location highlights with clever anecdotes in English, Spanish and Spanglish. Even those that came in a little apprehensive about traversing the submerged sections were so distracted by his conversation and reassurances that they didn’t hesitate to follow along.  Proved to be the highlight of our Tulum adventures.",50,63
"It’s nice to swim and cool off from the hot sun, especially if you first wasted time going to Tulum, but I wouldn’t view this as a primary destination. There were a lot of people; more than is comfortable for the size of the cenotes. ",30,63
Cenote Tortuga came recommended to us from our resort and it did not disappoint! The tour was $25 and lasted 90 minutes. We swam in 4 different cenotes on the property- 2 closed and 2 open ones- all were amazing. Make sure to wear shoes you can get wet and bring $ for a locker. ,50,63
We stayed at the hotel on the property for two nights. With the hotel stay you get 50% discount on the cenote tour which turned out to be 100 pesos per person. The tour of the cenotes was great and we could enjoy the “open air” cenote all night when there were no other people. The hotel room had a small kitchen area which was perfect to cook small meals. Definitely worth the money if you prefer staying off the beaten path and away from the crowds.,50,63
This was our first trip to a Cenote and very near to where we were staying. For 450 pesos we were equipped with life vests and masks but not snorkels as they really weren’t needed.  The first Cenote was a small rocky pond to jump into. We walked 5 minutes to the second one which was like a open lazy river with jumping platforms. The third and fourth cenotes were caves that you swam through and out the other end.  At their lowest point the roof of the cave was 1/2m above the water surface.  I can get claustrophobic but our guide Leyver (great sense of humour and great English) shone a torch so it felt fine. Leyver’s party piece was free-diving down very deep and using a torch to light up the caves below us.  We have been telling everyone about these cenotes and it seems like they,50,63
" are very good value, some others are 600 pesos.     There was a photographer with us but no pressure to even have your photo taken.  There were toilets and change rooms and plenty of parking. The road was in fair condition so your car won’t be damaged!",50,63
"Tv it doesnt work.  Next door there is a construction and they start early 9 in the morning to make noise. Impossible to sleep. No breakfast at all. Pool close 9 pm to early. Empty place.  Not friendly staff.  First nigth I almost sleep on the street cuz nobody answer the bell door, I call by phone none pick up the phone so I decided to push the gate until I could open it and somebody sleepy shows up. I record the moment with my phone. For the price I pay its unbelievable. Back pain bed is not really comfy, sheets are old with holes and stains. Make sure you take mexican pesos with you otherwise they will charge in your card. I suppose to pay through booking but they say that they handle the charges by themselves. ",20,64
"You pay for beds but you get SOFA beds and they won't even do the beds or provide bedclothes despite the fact that the room description says BEDS. They didn't do anything whatsoever to sort it out and were very rude. We arrived at 5:30 pm so it was a reasonable time, they could have prepared the sofa beds or at least provided bedclothes (they said they would). Apparently the person that does the beds was gone and the 2 employees standing at reception chatting and doing nothing wouldn't lift a finger to help. We went for dinner, came back at 9 pm and there was no one at all (not even replies to booking.com) They also refuse to provide a managers contact details",10,64
"The location is perfect. The common places as well as the rooms are clean, the staff is nice. The rooms are quite big. The establishment is less then 5 minutes to walk to the city center.  Thank you very much for everything !",50,64
"Very nice place for that money fantastic value paid 55 US$,had a suit room balcony against the pool, nice and clean, soft bed and good wifi,tv was strange was like pay per view? no channels ? but i only stayed for one night because departing for akumal next day so the tv didnt matter,recommended will be back",40,64
"Mixed reviews and feelings on this hotel... in general the apartments are clean, a good size, cleaners are friendly... we didn’t use the pool even though it looked nice it didn’t get any sun as it’s shadowed by two hotels, maybe a different time of year you can lay out in the sun, I’m not sure?  This isn’t the hotel fault BUT literally 2 ft away directly next to Live Tulum is huge construction work going on, it’s the loudest concrete drilling I’ve ever heard and the floor was shaking, they’ve only just started the foundations so this work is right at the beginning stages of what looks like a new hotel being built next door.  It wouldn’t have been too much of a problem if my GF wasn’t working remotely for 4 hrs every morning... it starts at 9am on the dot so if you’re up and out",30,64
" of the hotel for the day it’s probably nothing to worry about.  We were miss sold on the free breakfast and not refunded that we booked through booking .com. The hotel said booking .com shouldn’t have advertised the free breakfast but that was one of the reason we chose this place over another hotel, we wasn’t reimbursed any money but was given a free bottle of Prosecco for the troubles which was nice...   so just a heads up because of Covid there is No breakfast or free bike rentals at advertised.  I think we were just unlucky and on another visit I’m sure the hotel would have been a way better experience, it’s wasn’t all bad.  The location is at the better end of down town and you can walk to everywhere downtown... the Mayan Ruins near the beach took us 40 minutes to walk to and a taxi to the Hotel Zone will cost between $200pesos - $400peso each way depending how are down the zone you go.   7/10 is a fair rating.",50,64
…,50,64
"Currently here and enjoying every minute of this time with my husband. Although our honeymoon with the few challenges along the way, I must say that the staff here is simply amazing. Heavy rain (cyclone) today and power had  been out for hours. One cannot control Mother Nature, but how we handle such ordeal is what makes the difference. They worked countless hours picking up the debris and getting the generator to began working again.   Aside from that, the first few days resulted in some quiet time enjoying the area. Truly authentic Mexican culture and some of the local restaurants were simply delicious. Off to Cancun tomorrow before heading back to Atlanta.",10,64
"Stayed here for week when we visited Tulum and couldnt have been happier.  The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, and it’s in a great location.  We took full advantage of the included breakfast (sausage, eggs, toast, fresh fruit etc.), pool (see attached pics) and the bicycles. We paid a 1000 mex peso deposit for the bicycles (which we got back when we checked out) and used them multiple times throughout the week. We loved the location of the hotel as it was close to the centre of town (10 min walk, 3 min cycle) and right by the main route to the beach area (40 min cycle, 10 min taxi). This place is great value for money and we were so glad that we made the decision to stay in the town over the $$$ beach hotels. Would 100% recommend this hotel!",50,64
"Quite a run down hotel in the outskirts of the city. Big rooms, and clean. But it is clear that the images online does not show reality and this entire hotel need a renovation.  Although what really really was the worst was: 1. The bikes, these rusty almost-falling-a-part bikes that they advertise they have, first they charge a 50$ deposit each although they are SO BAD. Not a hold, but a charge. Second, we had to change bike 4 times due to it falling apart. My wheel broke in one of the sights and I had to walk in 40 degrees heat with the bike all the way back to the hotel which ruined my day and not even an apology. Also the woman in the reception kept arguing for no reason instead of giving a new bike! 2. The woman in the reception HAS SUCH AN ATTITUDE. I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU PUT",50,64
"Rooms are spacious and clean. We got the a room with terrace and it was really nice.   The gym is very well equipped and the pool area is clean and super relaxing.   Mary at the front desk was AWESOME! Really friendly and helpful. So was the older gentleman working at the front. I deeply appreciate their awesome service!   The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars- There were small ants in the room :(  The hotel needs to call pest control ASAP!  Also- The cleaning lady was a little impatient and rude when cleaning. She would knock really hard and would come and clean in such a rush and with a little attitude.   Other than that, everything else is wonderful and I would definitely stay here again!!!",40,65
"We were staying for 3 nights and it was horrible. The staff is not able to speak english at all. The hotel is very noisy and loud, not only because of the bar next door. During our stay we got about 100 of blackouts but nobody cared. Everytime the electricity went on again, the ac made loud noises So we weren't able to sleep. We tried to speak to the manager but he just said its not the hotels fault. Never again! There are planty of nice and cute hotels around to have a better stay than this so called ""hotel"".",10,65
"We stayed here during our trip to Tulum and it was amazing. We checked in a little earlier than expected but the young lady at the front desk was super friendly and let us keep our luggage in a secure area. The whole process was fast and the location is great! The hotel from the outside and inside offered vibrant color schemes and the rooms were very comfortable for the price. We will definitely want to stay again when we come back to Tulum! We weren’t able to go to the Gran Cenote like we planned due to timing but it’s on our future bucket list. The breakfast that was included at the hotel was delicious and very well presented. Fresh fruit of different types, eggs, juices, coffee. So good! One of my favorite parts about Mexico was the fresh squeezed juices and local cuisine.",50,65
" The hotel has a very nice pool on the roof and it’s beautiful at night! We stayed here during “Dia de los Reyes” Kings Day, January 6. There was a festival (Rosca de Reyes) just blocks away from this hotel and everyone was super nice and welcoming. We took part in the festival and had free kings cake. This was the first time I’d tried it and we thought it was very delicious! I can’t wait to have it again! Yum! I would highly recommend this Funky-Fresh place to anyone looking to have a great time in Tulum and not break the bank! Both sides of the street are full of shops, bicycle rentals (recommended for travel) and tons of delicious Mexican food. Thank you for making our trip an amazing experience.  We can’t wait to return for more fun adventures. ",50,65

"The most negative and unfriendly welcome I have ever experienced on arrival at a hotel. The staff at reception are literally the antithesis of the Tulum vibe. They then put us in a pokey room opposite the reception and when I asked if any other rooms were available they said “the hotel is fully booked” then I asked if I could pay for an upgrade and suddenly there were several options available. As a very regular traveler, in Europe and Asia whenever there is availability in a better room type then it is always curtious to offer it to guests. To add insult they told us that we would only have continental breakfast with our room type, we then showed them our booking which included American breakfast and they appeared very disappointed that they agreed to this, why a hotel like",10,66

They are those people who Kill the good vines of Tulum. We took the best room with the view on the ocean.. we couldnt spend Time inside because of.. a smell ! Our room was built in the same batiment of an other room. I met the family of this room at the reception because they explain it was impossible for them to stay here because of this smell. But what smell ? Them, like us, without say to each other anything had the same certitude : an animal dead is in our room or in the airconditionning système. The first day we said it to the staff : « ok we will do something » The second day we said it to the staff : « ok we will",40,66
" do something » The third day, we kept our forces to stay cool because it was holliday, but it begun very hard « ok we will do something » The 4th day, we ask our money to be back for our last night (we have two kids of 4 and 2 yo but we were ready to take all our luggages to change just for one night so it was a torture), « oh no sorry, it will be ok for your last night » and NO. We felt tricked. At 8 o clock, we asked the director and no the simply manager who did nothing and had a so bad contact. We didn’t want to pay our extra untill seen the director.. nobody. We had to take our flight and we had to pay. The manager say « ok you pay but monday, i call you » ahahah of course NO ! This hôtel is a shame who didn’t respect people who stay here When we come back, the smell was so horrible that it encrustes our luggages and our clean landry.. i had to wash everything and i let my luggages in the garden, triying to get rid of the smell ! Finally i had to throw them in the bin",50,66

"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE We stayed 4 nights in the biggest suite (S3) of this hotel. It was my WORST experience of my life. The smell in the room was terrible, a mix with toilet and dead animal smell. We noticed it to the reception since the first day and wanted to change room. Nothing has done, they let us sleep with two children of 2 and 4 years old in that smell during 4 nights. NO APPOLOGIES OF THE MANAGER, NO COMPENSATION. The smell was so strong that all the clothes of our 4 luggages had to go to the pressing back home. I contacted them twice after we leaved, not a single response. The staff and the location is nice.

The host Pepe is great, very friendly and always available, if theres anything you need don't hesitate to ask him or his staff, I forgot the name of the lady that works with him but she is great to, they even hooked us up with a discount when we rented our golf cart (definitely rent one and go around the island, it was lots of fun).

The woman who maintains the location took us down to rent a gold cart, and it was significantly less than the other locations.    I wholeheartedly recommend both Isla Mujeres and Villa Bliss 18 (their name now).  We are from California, so watching the sun rise over the ocean is a treat for us (we only get sunsets.)",50,69
"We stayed here for 2 nights and had our well-traveled cat with us. The small, pet-friendly hotel is located in the La Gloria residential neighborhood towards the south end of the island. We had a wonderful stay! The room was clean and cutely decorated. There were fresh linens and extra towels, hot water (which we didn't always have on our travels through Mexico!), and bottled water on our arrival. The hotel has a small pool and a shared outdoor kitchen in the enclosed courtyard. Ricardo was extremely helpful in getting us checked in late, communicating easily through WhatsApp. We had an easy 3 km walk to Punta Sur, enjoyed the beautiful location, then caught a taxi to the north end of the island. Be forewarned, La Gloria is a residential neighborhood so expect a much more",50,70

"Cada Azul is in a great location of the island, close enough to the action but far enough to be quiet. Great beach close by and great restaurant just across the road. Cute rooms, good aircon and wifi. Only downside is the bathroom has a curtain rather than a door. ",50,71
"Guys we just had an amazing stay at casa Alkimia!! I don’t even know where to start if with the beauty of the place or the warm hospitality that we received! The place is everything and so much more than we expected. As soon as you arrive to the property your dream vacation begins! Everything to the last detail was so thoughtfully brought to life. All rooms overlook the beautiful Caribbean and you wake up to the waves every morning. The room was beautiful  very clean and relaxing, bed was super comfortable and was good to get in it after a full day of exploring the island. The rooftop was one of the best perks about casa Alkimia, we got in the pool both days and it was truly amazing relaxing and watching the Caribbean.

He went out of his way and truly cared about us having a great time. He made some amazing recommendations so we are sure that if you stay here he will 100% take care of you. The area was very nice and quiet as well, we had no issues whatsoever and the whole island itself is super safe and secure. Guys, look no further because casa Alkimia is the place you need to stay!!",30,72

This is a great place to stay on Isla Majures.  There is one bedroom with a bathroom on the main floor and three bedrooms on the 2nd floor.  Two of which have an extra single bed in them.  All have their own bathroom and a balcony.  Linen was clean and fresh.  There is independent a/c in each bedroom as well.  There is a great sitting area on the roof with a small heated swimming pool.  The sunrises were the best from there.  Although there is a set of condo's under construction to the east which will somewhat block the view of the gulf in the future. The main floor has a large living room with fans.  The kitchen is as better equipped than any other resort or AirBNB I've ever stayed in and the dining area is adequate for 10-12 people.  We had an issue with the oven and the,50,73
"Nos quedamos en este lugar y fue la mejor elección. Es realmente amplio y cómodo. Está impecable en términos de limpieza. Ubicación inmejorable. Tiene AC tanto en la zona del living como la habitación. Candelaria (el dueño) fue muy amable pues una de nosotras se enfermó y tuvimos que mover la reserva. Nos permitió reagendar sin cargos. Definitivamente recomendable. Al frente hay una tienda de buceo muy buena y está al lado de la avenida donde están todos los restaurantes, comercio etc. volveremos a este lugar sin dudas.",50,74
"We have been renting with Cande at  Cande's Apartments for 5 years.  He is a great landlord and the apartments are all very nice. They have all the amenities needed as well as a beautiful shared roof top area. The location is perfect, close to everything.  Cande is responsive to any problems (of which there are very few!) and deals with things as soon as possible. Highly recommend!",50,74
Cande was very friendly and accommodating. The apartment had everything we needed and was kept very clean. It was also the perfect location and the price was good. We had the one bedroom with the balcony which made it fun to sit out and people watch.  We will be back!,50,74
"Maybe we got the ""dud"" room because it looked nothing like the photos in the ad. Maybe they accidentally gave us a staff room. Maybe we got the last available room?      We have been to Isla for the last 20 years about 15 times, so we have stayed many places. We don't need ""fancy""---we're out most of the time, but there are some needed requirements for us! First off, the internet was extremely spotty. There isn't a lobby per se to retreat to with hope of wifi connection. Our balcony didn't help us either except for a partial view of the ocean and a lovely breeze.      The location is great by being near the malecon (love the little restaurant and music venue the ""TIny Gecko"") and of course many restaurants and stores.      The kitchen was old and bordering on creepy. We had to",20,75

The coffee pot had no carafe in it!      Towels had stains, we did get hot water which is top on my list . After week one we left and found a lovely apartment near the liquor store (can you say convenient?!!) that had all supplies and was super clean.       We checked out of Sueno with no problem. Won't go back.",10,75

"Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Nothing like the photos. Noisy, smelt of rotting garbage, no hot water, dirty kitchen, broken windows. A man found dead in the hotel during our stay (see news reports!) and hotel was shut down. We were not offered another hotel even though other guests were, so were forced to spend Christmas period with police outside our rooms guarding a crime scene- horrific experience. Avoid! Have tried to contact hotel since and have been ignored.",10,75
"This is NOT a 2-3 star hotel.  One star at best.  Construction noise past 9pm?!  Hammering, chiseling?  Sawing?  What hotel does this to their guests?  My room was nothing like the photos.  I repeat NOTHING like the pictures.  Horrible stay.  Will not return.",40,75
"There was CONSTRUCTION INSIDE THE BUILDING my entire prepaid stay. There had been no notice this would happen when I booked and before I arrived. Concrete drilling and hammer-and-chisel off-and-on all day until 8:30-9:00pm. My room #17 was on the same floor. The noise sounded all around, loudly, because that's how concrete conducts sound -- through the walls, floors, and ceilings.   Both sinks both dripped steadily. A constant sewer smell from the kitchen sink drain had to be blocked by a cereal bowl covering it. There were no clothes hangers, no wall hooks. The stair landings were treacherous to negotiate, due to odd tile placement -- some ""decorative"" touch, seems. Bed mattress was old, sheets were thin and bunched up under me at night. There were families living along a",50,75
" courtyard below my walkway. Loud children and barking little dos until 11pm -- what the ??   I do not understand how others rate this horrid hotel very high. The owner doesn't care. When I asked for a partial refund for staying while construction was going on, I got the ""no comprende"" look until I walked away. Wi-fi was inconsistent, too, likely because front desk and maintenance employees were all on their phones, thumbing away, burning up bandwidth. I've lived on Isla. Before that, I'd stayed many times, going back to 1991. This was the rudest, most inconsiderate stay I've had in all that time. There are better hotels in the same price range. Find them, stay there. Avoid this one.  Oh yeah, the room safes don't work, just take up space.",50,75

"This hotel is for someone who is looking to spend time OUT of the hotel. It's a nice enough place to stay, change, sleep, shower, etc.. but it's in no way luxurious or where you'll want to have a relaxing vacation. It's a short walk from the beach. The only problems we had here were that I had exchanged USD for pesos and they said it was a bit more, I think we ended up paying $15 more than expected. And the air conditioner leaked a large puddle onto the floor. Everything at the hotel was simple and we had a great stay.",40,75
"We stayed in room 18. The room itself is plenty big with a kitchenette and decent size refrigerator. Most things needed are provided.  The room has a very large patio we enjoyed nightly. Note that the room faces east and will have bright morning sun. If this is not something you enjoy, you may want a different room. With that said, you will also be missing out on some great views and ocean breezes.  This hotel is a very short walk to the Super Aqi grocery store and many good restaurants and bars, yet far enough away from the ferry landing and loud strip. However it is very walkable to get to from the ferry.  There are plenty of places just outside of the hotel to rent golf carts (right across the road) to explore the island.  We had great service as well. ***Note: sometimes the",40,75
"We were excited to spend time here this March. We were going to spend time with our son, daughter inlaw and grandson. Our son and his family happened to be in Isla Mujeres and went to inspect this property and to reintroduce themseleves as they have stayed there before. What they found was that there is construction all about, windows boarded up and the buildings in a state of unacceptable conditions. They immediate messaged the owners and got a refund. I messaged them and he refused to refund my deposit. This is the first time using Airbnb and am totally disappointed as they are of no help.  I received a message from the owner and it was basically a ""screw you"" too bad for you. BE AWARE THIS PROPERTY IS NOT AS ADVERTISED>",10,76
"I reserved 5 days at Mar y Sol.  I arrived at night and by the next day, it was clear that this was the spot I was hoping to find along my travels!  So I stayed for the entire length of my trip, 30 days.  Now, if you are looking for something fancy, this is not your place.  But if you want something private with an peaceful environment and the most welcoming host ever, Roberto, this is your place.  My 7 year old daugther and I loved loved loved it!  Safe, comfortable, amicable, close to awesome snorkling and captain dulche, this place will surprise you.    Try no to give the cleaning lady tequila....your room might not get cleaned the next day!!!  But if you ask Roberto (Of course in a nice manner), he'll do anything!  We will go back no doubt about it!",50,76
"We spent five nights at Mar y Sol in unit #7, one of the two upstairs units in the newer (bright yellow) building.  We absolutely LOVED it!  The room is huge with a nice balcony and hammock that looks out over the water.  The kitchenette allowed us to cook a hot breakfast every morning.  The beach is right outside the door and the sand is fine and soft.  There's a pier very close by that is fun to jump off of and swim from (bring a snorkel!).  It's very quiet at night and the bed was comfortable.  It's only a 10 minute walk into the small town of La Gloria which has wonderful restaurants (you must go to La Bruja!), a grocery store, and a town plaza nice for observing local life.  I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.",50,76
"My husband & I stayed here for 2 weeks in March/April 2013. The kitchenette was sufficient to make our meals. It had a microwave, fridge, sink, & 2 burner hot plate. Since we're on a special diet, this worked well for us. Some of the metal things in the room were a little rusty, probably from being near the water. The location was great. It was like having a home on the beach. There were not a lot of other guests when we were there, so it was very quiet for us. It's close to the public bus line also. One drawback is that the you can't get in to the water from the beach in front of the hotel. There seems to be a foot or so of much in the water that sucks you down when you walk on it. But, you can just walk south a bit to the pier and get in the water there and swim. The peace &",30,76
" quiet was disturbed occasionally by the party boats that come from Cancun to the restaurants/bars on either side of this place. But, it didn't bother us that much. For the price, we think it was a great value. You are right on the water and far enough away from the road that it's quiet. We really enjoyed out stay there. I can't say what it would be like with a lot of guests, but there are only 8 units, so there wouldn't be a huge crowd anyway. They were very good about bringing drinking water whenever you needed it and generally taking care of any problems we had.",40,76

"Cute little apartments with a small kitchen area.  Overall it was fine and the beach was great...even had a perfect palm tree leaning over the water.  We did not have any water pressure in the shower and the mosquitos were terrible in the room but that was an easy fix with the help of bug spray!  So nice to sit on the little back porch and enjoy coffee while the sun comes up.  We stayed in the newer building, room 6, which had a/c and it kept the room very cool.  The beds were not very comfortable but that seemed to be the case everywhere.    The caretaker and cleaning lady were extremely nice and we had a good time visiting with them and her kids.   At less than $70 a night (with a/c, and being right on your own beach) it was a great value!",40,76
"We have stayed here before and it was about the same as before......we really like the area and the rooms, but it isn't for everyone.  Like upscale camping.  We were there right after the hurricane and there was flooding, but not as bad as many places.  We were the only people there and loved the privacy.  We will stay there again and would recommend Mar y Sol for people like us.  Rented from Mornings in Mexico and they were great to work with.",30,76
"Went on our first trip to Mexico in oct. 2009. Decided on Isla Mujeres based on reviews from friends. Wanted cheap accommodation, on the beach, away from all the tourist traps. It was perfect! Stayed on the old building - a yes, I admit it was a worn down, but the sea-view and the beach and the price makes it all worth while. We only used the room for sleeping and showering and in the regard, Mar Y Sol is worth it. We spent a lot of time on the beach, tanning and swimming in the sea - the snorkling isn't all that bad. Went into town every day - just walk along the road and a cab will come by every 5-15 minutes. We have now become parents - and would love to come back - might even return to Sol Y Mar with our son (we might prefer the new building now, as it is in a better shape",40,76

"We book over booking .com  It was:ISLA HOTEL CARACOL. When we arrive we couldn't find hotel   They change name: CASA ESPANA.. We seach walk around over 2 hours. Finally we call them find out........,,, Hotel is old  bed was noisy not worth what we payed.   I wouldn't stay here again ",20,79
"Casa Espana is a small hotel right in the middle of town. It's situated within minutes of the ferry terminal, beaches and all the shops, restaurants and bars. However it is quiet and peaceful, with rooms facing into a small courtyard and pool area. The staff were all very friendly and made our stay very pleasant. The room was clean and comfortable and very good value. Highly recommended",20,79
"I made the mistake of asking for a small reading lamp as the room was very dark at night.The bad attitude of the Jefe/manager turned me right off this place.That and two glasses for our room was more than he could manage.He even sneered at me that people who/stay there don't read! We have lived and travelled extensively in Mexico for over forty years and have grown to love the charm and quirkiness of small Mexican hotels.We can overlook no clean towels the broken stair railing and no maid service but we can not overlook bad attitude in the hotel service industry from management. This hotel is geared to budget long,stay snow birds and as several told us it suits their needs perfectly.The room as seen on the,website is rented for whatever the market,will bear on a day.somedays",10,79
"So, we were took our golf cart to the ""bar next door"" to this but were told that they were too full? Really? We decided to walk next door to Skulls Landing and have a drink and come back. Well, thanks ""bar next door!"" We walked into awesome music, friendly staff (Tiffany and Julio) and just a good island overall vibe. We ended up staying here a long time and having a blast! They staff gave us tons of tips about the island. Needless to say, so long "" bar next door"" HELLO Skulls Landing!!!!! See you soon! The 4 from Green Bay Wisconsin!!!!",50,80
"El mejor lugar en Isla para relajarte, beber algo rico y comer delicioso. Me encantó el muelle, puedes estar ahí pasando una buena tarde. El atardecer es hermoso. Me encantó disfrutar con mis amigos el atardecer.",50,80
"We opted for a large room with a king bed, and were lucky to get a room on the second floor. Very comfortable room, bed, everything. Good lighting, black out curtains, artwork, etc. The icing on the cake was the fabulous breakfast we got each day. A lot of places are kind of miserly about breakfast - not Mestizo Gallery. They serve both juice and a generous fruit plate, an entree of chilaquiles, eggs, pancakes or waffles - every one of them absolutely delicious - served with excellent coffee. WE also ate dinner here twice, and loved the food. It's not enough to prepare food well, you have to start with good ingredients, and the chef/cook here does.",50,81
"I booked this hotel to stay for August 20-21, 2021.  We were staying in Cozumel and planning to take the ferry to Playa del Carmen and dive the cenotes when we were in Tulum.  Unfortunately, Hurricane Grace came in on August 19th, 2021.  It damaged the docks in Playa del Carmen.  We were unable to get to Tulum due to the damages.  Despite explaining this in the cancellation of our stay they refused to cancel even a portion of the cost of the room.  We had planned to dive Cenotes another time and stay with them.  I will NEVER stay with them now.  I have many friends that dive and I will let them know to avoid this hotel.",10,81
"This hotel is located right in the middle between Tulum Beach and Tulum Downtown. It’s one of the closest hotels to most of the cenotes including: Cenote Calavera, Gran Cenote, Cenote Car Wash and Cenote Zacil Ha. It was in walking distance to tulum downtown and bike ride to the beach is fairly short. To me it was the perfect location, also right next to an atm, grocery store, taxi stop and restaurants.  I was nervous going to Mexico but this place really felt like a home away from home. Food and drink is amazing. The free breakfast is so good with so many options and I can’t stress enough how amazing the staff was. When we would use the pool the staff would always hand us towels to dry off with out us even asking and when we would order food/drink they would bring it to us",50,81
 where ever we wanted (room or pool). When I go back to Tulum I will definitely be booking with this hotel no doubt!! I was actually sad to leave this place.  10/10 recommend this place! Do not hesitate to book with Meztiso Hotel.,40,81

"The hotel room was very clean, quiet, and spacious.   The breakfast was good and the staff were helpful and kind.  We stayed 2 nights and realized Tulum is not for us and we spent our days in Akumal.  It is within walking distance to things, but it is a very busy area.  So, if Tulum is for you this is a clean and spacious place to stay.",50,81
Only stayed 1 night but it was very enjoyable and can recommend.  We arrived about 6 pm on a Friday night and once we got settled into our well decorated room we walked the city and had a blast.  Our stay came with a free breakfast and it was an ideal ala cart breakfast.  Sounds a bit boring but on our way back through Tulum five days later we stopped there for breakfast again.,20,81
"I’ve stayed here multiple times this past year. It’s such a beautiful clean environment within walking distance to grocery store, corner stores and restaurants plus main BLVD. The staff and owners  are so friendly and willing to serve you at anytime. I love walking to the atrium that has a decent wading pool after a long hot day. Each morning I’m greeted with the best fresh juice and rolls with my choice of eggs Or hot cakes. Splendid service with such kind smiles. I feel like they want me here and are willing I help at every turn. The staff that’s cleans the room daily are the best. Always accommodating and willing to show up. If you’re looking for a place that’s between the town and beach look no further. This is the place to be! Groceries and restaurants within walking",50,81
" distance  and bikes for free that are In Good shape to get to the beach. After several stays this is my home. I feel they treat me as if I’m family. As they would you! It’s decent, well appointed and I love the fresh plants and incense you leave in the room.   I’ll be here next week and I know the staff is ready t serve all that comes through the door. I love feeling like I’m home and that they care about how I feel. The grounds, staff, food, cleanliness, and just overall you wouldn’t be disappointed.   See y’all the 26th if you stay. From Jose to Felipe and all above they are so beautifully friendly. You won’t regret this gem!!",50,81

This is the perfect spot to spend your vacation or special date. We really enjoyed my birthday night.   Is all clean and the owners is kind and helpful. All supplies to prevent COVID-19 is provided.   The view right from the bed is amazing and peacefull,50,82
Stayed February 2017. Perfect mid island ocean front apartment. Host is very responsive. Apartment with restaurants within walking distance. No beach access on location. Parking on site for golf cart. We will stay again. ,50,82
"A beautiful place with wonderful people running it. Peter is very attentive and helps with everything that is needed, the place was clean and quiet while being in a very good location. would go there again",50,83
The staff was very helpful and recomended us about atractions and resturants.  We had a problem with the hot water in the shower and they took care of it very quickly.  They made our stay very enjoyable and comfortable.  Muchas gracias amigos!!! ,50,83
"Location is pretty good. Right next to a big crossing which makes the street a bit busy, but has the advantage of making it easy to go to the beaches and Mayan ruins. Also, there is a huge supermarket when you cross the street. The city center is at walking distance, and you'll easily walk to all the restaurants and the boulevard.  The hotel itself is fine. Everything is like in the pictures and works good. Also, there is a fridge which makes that you can cool your own water our beer. The feel of our room was very luxurious. They are doing some renovations, but we did not notice a thing.   Staff of this hotel is great. Very friendly, helpful and trying to go the extra mile wherever they can.  I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks again!",50,83
I had booked a reservation for March 23 and was very excited for my visit to Tulum however because of the ongoing COVID19 situation the Canadia n government has advised all citizens to avoid unnecessary travel because of this unforeseen global pandemic. We reached out through booking.com to cancel our reservations and were told that they were unable to make an exception and that they could not refund our booking again because we are unable to make our reservation due to the A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. So this business does not care about their guests as you are just another transaction. Una deception muy grande que ustedes resultaron tan chanta. So disappointed that an alleged reputable establisment would have zero understanding towards this very specific and unexpected situation. Zero,10,83

"My spouse and i stayed here for two nights and would have stayed longer if time permitted.   The rooms weren't fancy, but were very clean had everything you would need.  The staff was incredibly helpful in getting around. Freshly prepared breakfast with several options was a highlight! The bikes available for use provided even more freedom around the area. The Pacha Tulum is located just off a main intersection, but was very quiet.   Would absolutely stay here again on our next visit to Tulum.",50,83
"My partner and I stayed here for just the one night, which was highly disappointing, as I could of stayed for days! It’s the perfect little place, hidden away of the main Tulum road, so it’s a great location! (With no noise! ) the pool and breakfast area is really cute, along with breakfast being really tasty! It’s included in the room rate and you get a choice of about 5 options, along with tea and coffee! The owner is Italian, so as you can guess is super friendly, welcoming and happy to help in any way. The bedroom we stayed in (room 14, deluxe suite) was bloody amazing!! Two big super comfortable beds, nice lounge area, with a great bathroom, shower room! Will definitely come back here to this little hidden gem!",50,83
Lovely boutique hotel in the centre of Tulum. Very clean and comfortable and 20 min bike ride from the beach. Lovely and helpful staff. You will feel like at home. Bikes rent and delicious breakfast included!,10,83
"My partner and I stayed here for part of our large holiday. The hospitality here is amazing! The hotel is small and has a kind of rainforest feel! The rooms have everything you may need and indeed not 5 star luxury but the beds are comfy, the air con is great and the bathroom is all you need :)  We found the free hire of bikes, snorkels and flippers the best! Saved so much hassle and money! Just leave your deposit and done!  Also there is a big shopping centre across the road for supply’s, 2 restaurants next door is you want a quick meal or about 1km walk to the main strip!  The breakfast was fabulous! And everyone we encountered was lovely and tried to make our stay as amazing as possible!  Thanks guys! ",50,83
"This could be the poorest designed and poorest equipped rental I have experienced anywhere. Very poor wifi (none in some rooms). Maid service once a week! Inadequate seating at unattractive pool. In short, look elsewhere ",10,84

"I booked this accommodation mostly for its nice looking rooms and air conditioning. When we turned up we were greeted by a topless man who was the owner. He gave us a very brief viewing of the communal areas and then took us to a door that looked like Harry Potter's cubboard under the stairs. We both thought he was joking, no door handle, but a hasp and clasp with the most insecure padlock I have ever seen. Inside the room it had no air conditioning, which when it's 30+ degrees for me is essential, especially when that's why we booked the accommodation. He had 4 fans around the bed as an alternative. There was no TV or mini bar as advertised. We went straight back onto booking.com and booked ourselves another room on the other side of the island. I would not recommend a stay at",10,84

What makes this Hostel special however, are the people. The receptionist in particular, is one of the nicest and most helpful and accommodating people we’ve met in Mexico.

I stayed 3 nights here in private room with shared bathroom. The room is spacious and the price is very affordable and it includes breakfast. They give some variety with the breakfast in different days. They also provide free bicycle use which makes it so easy to explore Tulum. I used the bike twice to explore the cenotes and to go to the beach. I really like the design of the hostel with wooden materials and nature/village look. The owner Eric and his uncle are very cool people. They're very friendly and helpful with your questions. I left my jacket at the hostel and they're kind enough to help to get it sent to me in Playa. This is definitely the place I'll stay again if I go back to Tulum. Muchas gracias!,50,84

The staff didn't really care about anything, our light blew leaving our room (due to no windows) absolutely pitch black, they told us they had called an electrician. After 24 hours in darkness we opted to move out, I asked for a discount for the night as we were literally in darkness and they were rude and horrible and threatened to call the police.

There was a cigarette butt in plain sight against one of the walls, and black dirt and large dust bunnies were everywhere.  The bathroom absolutely reeked, and a quick inspection revealed why:  There was mold EVERYWHERE.  All over one wall, up on the ceiling, etc.  When I pulled back the top sheet it was obvious from what I found that the sheets had not been changed since the last hotel guest was there.  More minor:  Stated there was cable TV, but it isn't.  There are 4 channels, and they barely function.  There is a common area for cooking, but like the room it was disgusting.

The room was small with no real place to put your suitcases. The door to the room is a double door which closed with a clear gap -- a little disconcerting both for security and for the ability of mosquitos to get in. A continental breakfast is provided which was OK, nothing special. I think if we needed to be there more nights we would have changed hotels.  Not directly related to the room, but that part of Tulum was really torn up -- construction all around, streets torn up, dust everywhere. Not sure how long that will be the case but our shoes, suitcases, etc. were covered in dust.",30,90
Where do I start... -WAY TOO OVERPRICED -The doors to the room are so flimsy it does not feel safe you could literally push it open -There was no running water for most of our stay and no one seemed to help. We tried to ask to speak to the owner 3 times and were told by reception you can but he can be quite difficult!? I'm sorry what!? We're being robbed of £180 a NIGHT for an awful room with no water!? He literally ran away and was not seen again. -The rooms weren't clean when we arrived especially the showers with old shampoo bottles and previous guests hair -When the shower did decide to work it was awful anyway -They booked us a 7am tour for the last day and said we could leave our luggage at reception and check out after the tour. Come 7am reception was locked no one to be,10,90
 seen so we had to beg the tour guide to take our luggage and we couldn't check out. -They owed me change for hiring bikes which I never recieved. -We got up at 6:30am before our tour and the security guard seemed to be funnelling what looked like homeless children out of spare rooms at the hotel which were getting into the boot of a bashed up taxi. The children looked us in fear liked we'd caught them in the act - Very very Odd DO NOT STAY HERE it is a complete and utter rip off.,20,90

"Although the staff were great and tried hard it really did not live up to the description.   We booked a “suite” for eight hundred usd for three days over new year and the suite did not include a living space which is what I understood a suite to be. The suite, room fifteen, is a larger bedroom with private bathroom but apart from size no different to a standard room but with a larger bed.  Whilst there was a balcony, this was the walkway to all the rooms and so was not suitable for sitting on and there was no seating on the balcony or in the courtyard garden.    On the first night the toilet was blocked. This was cleared by the staff the next day but obviously effected our use of the room. On the second night the shower drain blocked causing the shower to overflow into the",10,90
" bedroom (which is a step down from the bathroom) and flooding one half of the room. The staff tried very hard to deal with it by putting towels all over the floor and by building a small wall of towels to stop further flooding, but our luggage and some clothes were wet and we could no longer shower.  During the second night there was no running water in the taps so we could not brush our teeth before bed.    On the final day the staff offered a standard room to move to which we accepted. This was better in the sense that it all worked.    In return for for the disruption to our stay the owner refunded twenty five dollars out of the eight hundred we had paid.    The Wi-fi only worked near reception.    The breakfast consisted of some fruit with toast and a coffee. Very limited for price I think.    The lock on room fifteen was not very secure and if you rattled the french doors, which were the entrance, then the one bolt on the door would drop and you could open the door without the key.    Honestly I would not choose this place at these prices again.",50,90

Not safe. Not trustworthy. Not recommended. Police came after guest reported in room theft. Below is a photo of police officer that responded to the call. This place is located in a residential area. It’s open without proper security. Anyone on the street can walk up to rooms.,30,90
"On December 30, 2018 I stayed at this hotel. Someone came into my room in the middle of the night when I was out and took my wallet with all of my cash. Although the room door locks it can be easily open by sliding a credit card. Below is a still shoot of a video that we took to show how easily anyone can break-in by sliding a credit card.  This place does not have security boxes for storing valuables. It is a very unsafe place. We reported this theft to the police, the owner, and told as many guest as we could.  Even though they say they have a “security” guard it is of no use and it is a very sketchy place. I regret staying here.",40,90
"Wonderfully appointed apartments close to downtown Tulum and directly next to 2 major grocery stores and the bike path to the beach. Even better, bikes are included with your stay making this an unbeatable value. Beyond friendly staff, small refreshing pool which was a always a great stop after biking back from the beach. Our unit faced the street which is small an unpaved. There is currently a condo development under construction directly across the street which the owners warned us about. However, this was never an issue and we were never bothered by noise. Tulum is a place of high development so you’d be hard pressed to find somewhere without something under construction close by.  Highly recommend this place!",50,91
"We stayed at the Nah for 2 nights on November 3rd and 4th 2019.  We got picked up at the airport (we are familiar with the buses, but the price of the transportation offered by the Nah was very affordable) The bus driver was there on time, we had a comfortable ride and a nice conversation; the driver speaks English.   At the Nah, the room was ready for us, the keys were provided by the security (we arrived after hours). The room was very clean and the kitchen had everything we needed to make a quick supper. We got our groceries at the Chedraui, which is located only 5 walking minutes away.   The staff at Nah is very friendly. Thank you for your help, Vanessa!  We will stay at Nah again next year.",50,91
"Tulum Nah was perfect. The 1 bedroom apartment overlooking the sweet little pool, was very clean, comfortable and really well set up with everything you could need. The owners are gorgeous and are there to help out I’d needed but basically stay in the background otherwise. The small block of apartments is situated near restaurants, a BRILLIANT supermarket and not far from the beach by bicycle... which is provided free. Traveling alone, I felt very safe in this pretty haven.",50,91
"Very impressed with tulum nah apartments spacious clean kitchen even had a microwave, the pool isn’t large but is perfect for a dip after being in the ocean perfect temperature nice fluffy towels for the pool and bathroom.Salvador Theresa and Jesus were excellent hosts very helpful and kind and the best thing is the price sooo reasonable by the way Salvador I hope you had a good trip and I hope Theresa and Jesus are having a little break too ciao for now I’ll be back for sure!    ",50,91
"Salvador and Theresa were super nice and accommodating. The location was perfect for us. A little bit away from everything but close enough to easily get to. A quick bike ride to town or the ruins or the beach. And they provided the bikes at no charge, just needed to leave a deposit or your passport. Grocery store right down the road. The room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. We will be staying here again when we go back to Tulum.",50,91
"This is an excellent hotel in Tulum. The location is perfect: within a walking distance to the grocery store and only a few minutes (bike or taxi)  to the beach. We recommended the hotel to our friend, and she stayed there with her nefew. The hotel provided them with the bikes, so we got a chance to show our friends around the town. Their room was very nice and clean. The kitchen was equipped with everything a guest might need.  We got to hang out with our friends a lot, and once they cooked us a breakfast. Recently, some other friends have asked us if there are any great hotels in Tulum. Without a doubt, we recommended the Nah.",50,91
"Super comfortable accommodations! Will definitely stay here next trip. Private, quiet and beautiful! I highly recommend to anyone looking to go to Tulum and not be in the crowded touristy areas but still have access to everything which is all a bike ride away. ",50,91
We had a quick 4 night stay here.  Very clean!!! Filtered water is provided! A/C worked awesome. Free bikes with a refundable deposit. Great courtyard/pool area. Right off of beach and the main roads so everything is easy to access. 5 minute walk to Chedraui for whatever shopping you need to do. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Pablo was great and Salvador has the cutest welcoming committee ever! See the pics!,50,91
"Clean & modern one bedroom apartments in great location between the town and the beach. It's around 5 minute bike ride to the center and around 10 minutes to the beach.  There is also a huge supermarket two minutes from the complex.  The pool area is cool and they also have a roof top where you can soak in the sun any time of the year. They offer free bikes that are in great condition and also provide you with filtered water 24/7. Apartments are well equipped and even have a TV with Netflix!  Service here is beyond great. You will always find somebody who speaks english and is eager to help. Special mention to Pablo who literally saved us from missing a bus!  Highly recommended, would love to stay here again.",50,91
"Nice, comfortable, close to all attractions with very friendly and hospitable staff. Swimming pool, little park with hammocks. Free bicycles. It is close to a large supermarket and very convenient for exploring the city.",50,91
Mangle X eco was a pleasant stay for me and my wife. This eco friendly establishment was very clean with great service from all staff. Coming from a big city like NYC some would have a certain standard when going to a beach side resort. But if you would like a taste of what the local life can feel like this place will best suite your needs. Be aware this establishment uses solar energy for electricity so from morning to dusk there is absolutely no electricity available in your room. But there is a station to charge your phone and wifi service. We had a small but cute cabin like room with a  clean bathroom and a shower that uses filtered water from the river (lightly salty). Coffee and fresh fruit in the morning with other options close by just in case. Though i may speak good,40,92
" things about this resort i must say i speak HIGHLY of the concierge “Diego”. He was extremely attentive to our needs let alone everyone there. His energy when entering gives a family like feel as if you were here before. With his charm, smile and style he could easily run a 5 star hotel in NYC!! i see great things for him so keep him there and keep him happy because on my return i hope to feel the same way i am feeling while writing this.",10,92

Had 4 nights pre-paid and booked with this resort through United Travel last March 2020. 2 Days before my scheduled travel, mandatory lock downs were implemented and my work required that I do not do International travel. I called United airlines and United Travel to cancel due to the pandemic, I was credited my full airline ticket but United Travel told me they tried to contact the hotel and did not get through. The day following my check-in date, I got an email from the hotel stating that I was a ""no show"" therefore, I lost all my money. I tried repeatedly to explain to them that due to the global pandemic I followed all the steps and I would even accept credit for future date, they refused.

"This place, like all of Tulum, takes your breath away! the pathway to your room is a wooden archway, and you feel like you're in a fairy land (especially at night).  It's a great place to settle in for your trip with bikes that you can use for free to bike through the town or go to the wildlife reserve with the most amazing virgin beaches!   There's a cenote at the back of the property that you can kayak or paddle, but it's best enjoyed by swimming! We snorkeled from the property to a restaurant just a couple properties away on the water.  No shoes or shirt required there :)    The staff and Diego are so sweet and kind and attentive and it's close enough to all the big stores, restaurants and bars, but tucked away enough so that you don't hear the clubs at night.",20,92
We had a spontaneous over night trip to Tulum during our Cancun trip and was scrambling to find a last minute accommodation. We found this place and knew this was just the perfect place for us. If you’re an environmentally cautious person and enjoy simple hospitality as if you were staying at your grandma’s place then this is the perfect place for you! We stayed in one of their bungalows which is literally above the mangroves so you are really in nature. It is also very quiet and peaceful. Just a relaxing environment. Diego was so friendly and hospitable and really treated us as one of his friends. We look forward to staying here again when we are back in Tulum!,10,92
"I recently stayed here for the first time and can say this probably won't be my last. The eco-friendly hotel was unique and felt primitive with with a few luxuries to make your stay comfortable. The main areas of Tulum were a short drive away but the location of the hotel allowed it to feel remote and private. The cabins are secluded, surrounded by trees, water, and even have a cenote in the back. If you're looking to stay near the bustle of Tulum, but still have an peaceful escape into nature, these cabins are for you!",50,92
"My partner and I decided to spend a few nights in Manglex for our aniversary trip, and I am so glad we did! It is a beautiful place, connected to nature. It is so peaceful and quiet, it felt like a perfect place to connect with my girl.  It has a beautiful cenote in the back. The best way to enjoy it is to ask for some paddle boards to the front desk and chill on them while you watch the sunset. Then you can open a bottle of wine and get cozy watching the stars. This place is a bit far away from all the noise and ligth pollution from the rest of the hotels/restaurants so stargazing is amazing!!!  If you are looking for a chill, quite place to connect with your significant other; I highly recommend Manglex.  Special thanks to Rafa and Christina (staff) that were so helpful in our",50,92
"Everything seemed ok until we went to bed and the noise from across the street was unbearable. Music blasted each night until 4am. You could feel the bass in your body and hear the music, even with earplugs in. We asked to move to another room but this wasn't possible.   The owners started out friendly but quickly became extremely rude and defensive. For our last few nights they offered us earplugs and money to go out but we were exhausted from the lack of sleep (and didn't really want to stay our until 4am...).   We ended up finding another hotel at our own cost for our last night. The owner refused to provide a refund. It ruined our time in Tulum because we were too tired to make the most of the tours we had organised.   I can't even begin to explain how rude the owner was to",10,93
 us. DO NOT RECOMMEND,10,93

"The owner promised me to send an invoice. He didn't. I was writing 3 e-mails and calling them in Mexico - they promised me to send this time - really. After almost 4 weeks later I am still waiting for the document, which I need. This is really disappointing!   The room was ok, but the neighbor was doing some renovations and it was really noisy and hard to find sleep.   NO MORE - GRACIAS !",50,93
We stayed at this cute little hotel for four days over the new year period. It was fantastic. We had a spacious room on the ground floor which had everything that we required. Would certainly recommend this hotel. We arrived late in the evening and the owner was still on site to welcome us and show us to our allocated room. The female owner was also extremely helpful with information about places to visit etc whilst in Tulum. The hotel was located within the centre of Tulum which was ideal for us ,40,93
This is where you want to come to relax and enjoy Tulum. Close to the Main Street and a short taxi to everything. But what makes this a standout are the innkeepers. They are a lovely couple with great personalities and big hearts. Will definitely stay here again. ,30,93
We stayed 1 night in Centro Tulum and happy that we stayed here! The hotel has interesting colors and character and is nestled into a very busy central Tulum. Our room was perfect and comfortable and the hotel managers were very friendly and provided great recommendations for places to dine. We're very very happy to have stayed here!!,20,93
"This is a quaint family run hotel. The lack of a room safe is offset by the fact that the owner keeps watch over the courtyard from his office . It was a good value for the price.  It is a short walk to the main street in tulum.  Check the schedule of the fairgrounds across the street. We were kept awake until midnight by an obnoxiously loud concert in the park, and we noticed that the amusement rides were setting up there the morning of our departure. Otherwise quiet. There was no dresser in our room so we had to live out of our suitcase. Good water pressure and consistently hot.",20,93
"Right after I registered, I got an email from hotels.com with 3 questions. I responded that the hotel was pretty and the reception fine but that the hotel had been hard for me to find and I couldn't see any restaurants or anything nearby. True, it is only 4 blocks from the main drag, but for me it wasn't easy to find. There was a lot of dusty construction and the road seemed to lead nowhere. The hotel sign was obscured by a big tree and the front of the hotel seemed like a wall of twigs. The owner seems to have read what I wrote. She pounced on me a shrieked, ""This hotel is NOT hard to find. There are restaurants serving international cuisine close by. YOU are not normal. YOU have a problem."" I'm 74 and have traveled a lot, but I've never experienced rudeness like hers. Yikes!",10,93
" Don't I have the right to express my opinion on a (confidential??? doesn't seem like it) survey questionnaire? The room was fine and there was good wifi, but I had nightmares that night. Bad vibes! Both she and her husband seemed to resent Americans (""Mexico is cheap for you Americans"" - even though their hotel isnt THAT cheap for what it offers). Later I heard her talking to two different U.S. guests, both young, about how terrible yanquis are. ""Do you know the phrase 'Yankee Go Home'?"" I could hear her saying. They looked a little apologetic and crestfallen. Hey! It's not their fault. She has trouble both honoring an individual opinion AND not blaming an individual for the nation state s/he happens to be from.",10,93
"We stayed at Nativus Glamping because the prices in Tulum were crazy, and we were looking for something more authentic. I am so glad we found this place. Nativus Glamping is an oasis of peace, with a stunning private cenote in the ‘backyard’, and the loveliest staff. Staying in the glamping tents was comfortable; clean and no animals, comfortable bed, fans and a complete bathroom in the open air which also added to the magical experience. Nativus is in the South-end of the beach, which is more relaxed, without the over-the-top crazy music around, and surrounded by classy resorts (which cost a lot more per night!). Would recommend it to anyone.  Most of all I want to thank Vero, the lovely manager of Nativus. I had a medical emergency while staying at Nativus and had to get care",50,94

Then she helped me by calling every hospital in Cancun, until she arranged an appointment for me, which I could never have done on my own (not speaking Spanish). She showed such true interest in me and checked in on me every time she saw me. With her help, I got the care I needed just in time for my return flight. To me, a person like her in such a moment is priceless! She (and her dog) brings a smile on your face every day with her flair, great energy and loving care for guests.",10,94

"We were supposed to stay at Nativus from January 1st - January 4th.  Upon checking in, I noticed the signs and waiver form saying if our belongings were to go missing during our stay it would not be at the responsibility of Nativus even if our things were stolen from our room. I asked the attendant about this and he said well your room is already fully paid and I was provided with a tiny lock and a key. Which is better than nothing, but when there is a hole in the side of our tent and the windows only Velcro shut, the lock is pointless isn’t it? We were also very disappointed with the height of the tent, my 6ft husband couldn’t comfortably stand inside the room or enter through the door without crouching. I would never describe Nativus as a “luxury experience” as described on",50,94
 the website and booking confirmation.  Our room smelled of sewage and the “eco-friendly” bathroom meant that the sewage from the toilet was going directly onto the ground below/behind our tent. The bathroom is extremely unsafe and has uneven boards and exposed nailheads someone could step on while using the bathroom. The shower water also smells bad like a swamp.  The last straw was when I saw a large cockroach in our room. Because of this experience we left Nativus the same evening we checked in on January 1st. I made the evening attendant at the front desk aware of this but I am not sure he made anyone else aware or not.,30,94

We went to had a swim in the centote and some people (not guests that had pay $3 for a day pass) had taken the place and were had taken ovrto have a party, with alcohol (you were supposed not to take that to the cenote) plus loud music and one of the guys even peeing in front of us. When we repported it, they just asked the guys to turn the music down!  On top of that, the tents are small, you can almost not stand up, and at the supposedly complimentary breakfast we had to pay to have an omelette.

We have been there for only 4 days, but the stay was amazing and we really didn't want it to end. If you are afraid of staying and sleeping in tent, you shouldn't! Bed was really comfy, tent had everything what you need including air fan, to decrease the temperature. Bathroom in the fresh air under beautiful sky was terrific. Nature on the glamping area was beautiful and you have an access to the cenote with a platform for those who like to jump straight to the water. You can rent paddle boards for free. Breakfast was tasty, but might be a little more varied. Staff was extremely helpful and they were always there if you",40,94
I won’t recommend this hotel if you are looking security and trust.  I really had a bad experience during my staying in this hotel. I missed one of my belongings and they never made responsible or checked with their staff. Not serious business.,10,95
The hotel is a beautiful gem in Tulum. Small boutique hotel feeling with great and friendly staff. The rooms are beautifully decorated  The pool area it’s cozy with little palapas where you can relax away from the busy larger hotels  I definitely recommend you looking into this place for a relaxing stay close to many Tulum attractions,50,95

Awesome pool where you can hang out on days you don't wanna go to the beach.  I would definitely come back. If you are looking for a quite and relaxing place, this is it.",50,95
"I haven't checked out yet but I couldn't wait until I got home to rave about this place. If you are looking to enjoy Tulum, this is the perfect place to base. It's located in a quiet location, just 5 minutes from downtown and 15 from the beach by car. I spent a couple of nights with my friends and I will definetly be returning as soon as I can. It is tastefully decorated, the beds are comfy, and it has a pool that is perfect for just after a full day by the beach, or even to take one last swim before checking out. I especially enjoyed the roof top, a glass of wine under the stars with my friends was just what I needed to have the perfect weekend. Thank you Alma and all of her staff: Ricardo and Jesus, you made my stay!  See you soon!",50,95

They were overcharging me for items that were Not in my room. And When i told them they changed the bill! So we’re they stealing from me or trying to?!?! I ended up paying $600pesos ($30usd)  for what would have been $5usd.  They were rude to me as well when questioning them. There were so many workers but no one was doing anything it seemed, besides the nice bartender.  When I arrived they also made me wait 2 hours even when the room was clean.  Terrible. This is now Tulum.",10,96
"The hotel is located in the pueblo area of tulum, 5km out the beach. If you have a car its totally fine. The hotel has a Bali vibe, very clean and beautiful. Staff is great. Price is good. It’s a good choice for a more affordable stay in tulum, if you are not looking to stay beach front.  The only negative was breakfast. I don’t recommend you get it. It’s a la carte and only includes coffe OR juice and scrambled eggs. Anything else you have to pay. There are a great variety of coffee shops and restaurants serving breakfast so you don’t really need hotel breakfast in tulum.",40,96
"I booked a 3 night stay at the Strabon for a solo trip and ultimately decided to cancel my entire trip due to a shooting in the Tulum downtown area that killed two tourists, and injured 3 others.

"Really great stay, we stayed in the penthouse for 10 nights in Dec 2020, and it is hard to fault.  We have been in Tulum for over a month now and this is by far the best accommodation in the Veleta area.  Super clean, great housekeeping and full service stay.  Jonathan in concierge end to end provided an incredible customised service for us, always there to help with small details.  He even learnt that my daughter loved the hotel cat, so he brought her to our front door (up 2 flights of stairs!) so she could play with her and small things like that go a really long way, so a huge thanks to you Jonathan for making an already great stay truly memorable for us.  I really recommend this hotel to anyone staying in La Veleta.  Will definitely be back, thank you!",50,96
"At the reception the young personelle was treating everyone so well. Also, we asked for a room with a pool view and they offered it. If you need a hairdryer or iron you'll have to ask for them in the reception and return them once you are done using them. The pool is nice, however umbrellas are missing.  The only unpleasant thing was that we were trying to check out one night before and we were not given any money back, however this did not affect our oppinion on the property.",40,97
"Since you're looking for a hotel ........................ ""I'd stay here again.""  My 'reservations' reflect my own priorities, which might not be yours.  Mainly that we wanted a hotel with a pool.  Wish Tulum has one, and it's nice.  But they have no shade, nor umbrella's, nor overhangs, so we could only stop at it briefly, on the way to and from our room.  Couldn't 'hang out' at the pool.  Our room had no cabinets, dressers, shelves, so storage/unpacking was a challenge.  Bathroom is really small.  Tulum Town is still 'walkable,' but those extra blocks add up if you do it a few times a day.  We were in Room 33, which had a nice jungle view.  I think it would be advisable to be as far away from the main road as we were.  Hotel is clean, no shortage of hot water,  room has a safe",40,97

If I would have one negative comment, it would be to some customers of the hotel itself who do not respect the place by boozing around the pool with loudy music without respecting anybody...",40,97

We were initially offered a  room above the kitchen which had extremely low water pressure and was noisy but after a discussion were moved to a newer space that was more suitable for the 3 of us. El Captain the restaurant next door has tasty meals, we dined 2-3 times , ample servings. The large supermarket across the road kept us in cold beverages and any extras we needed , and fun to explore. We had a small fridge in our room, but not sure if other units have them.",40,97
"Staff was approachable, friendly, and  helpful, especially Eduardo, the night security guard. It's a tranquil little oasis, in spite of the fact that it's on the main road. A bit far from the beach (not walking distance), but close to the supermarket and 7/11.  El Capitan, the restaurant attached to it is very convenient, and also has very friendly staff. Food is not bad and affordable. I would stay here again.",10,97

"If you are a tequila-sodden dead-ender whose idea of a good time is slurping the dregs of other people's drinks til the wee hours before stumbling into the darkness and crumpling into a urine-soaked heap in the storm drain with a dead chicken and a lonely Mexican dog, then this is the place for you.  Whether it's the cluster of Liverpudlian soccer thugs chain smoking unmolested under the  ""Thank you for not smoking"" sign or the gut-stomping dance tunes blasting until ""Turn It Up Hour"" (the Babel equivalent of ""Quiet Hour"" everywhere else--around 3:15 a.m., I believe) this is the place for you.

No...wait...there is no chair.  Pop two valiums and go to sleep, but be prepared to wake up next to the Euro-trash flavor of the week (or perhaps vomit besmeared gringo) who WILL try to get into your room. (This happened to us twice in the same night).  Under the circumstances, the rooms were surprisingly clean (the rest of the place less so) and the beds comfortable, though it will do you no good.  It was pizza night when we were there, which they make from scratch and which was a bit like pizza fixings on a cracker.  Breakfast was acceptable, if you don't mind being limited to one pancake and two pieces fruit. The OJ was fresh squeezed, no limit on cereal coffee or eggs. Apparently they begin prepping breakfast early, that is, about 15 minutes after the dance music stops.  At that point the blender and the coffee grinders start, on high, and your sleep for the night is over. All 15 minutes of it.

The location is very close to everything in central Tulum. Something I was missing though was sockets next to the bed, so you can have your phone close to you during the night.",50,98
"Although the hostel is cheap, they do not offer the most basic services: bad bugs in the bed, hot room without turning on air conditioning, cold bath water, dirty breakfast dishes, people smelling cocaine at bar table, dirty pool and pass wrong values ​​of the tours which makes you pay more at the agency",50,98
"My boyfriend and I were pleased because we felt very welcomed here. Everyone working here was always smiling, always helping us find cool places and also making sure we had everything we needed. They do maintenance in the hostel daily and will even go into the rooms to clean if you wish. It’s close to the main strip and they have bikes to offer if you want one. There is books if you want to read, there is a pool that is warm and a bar next to it in case you want to get a drink and go straight to bed (which is what we did haha). There is WiFi but only in the main common area. They provide breakfast everyday that consists of eggs, toasts, fruits, juice, cereal and coffee.

Hotel is EXTREMELY clean (I’m a clean freak and this was above expectations), hotel and room were always smelling good, air conditioning working perfectly and very spacious room.

Great staff as well, would definitely come come back!",50,100

"We, as a family of four (two young kids), absolutely loved it here! Of course, Tulum by itself is a really interesting and fun chilling place. But this hotel and her owner (Paula) have made it much more fun and enjoyable than without.  Every morning they organize Yoga (with absolutely great teachers) and their breakfast and juices are really good! If you visit Tulum you have to stay at this hotel because then you experience the love and relaxation that have made this town a must visit in the first place :)  Location wise it was perfect for us because it was nice and quiet during the night. The Main Street is a 5-7 minute walk and the beach you can visit by bike or car. We have rented two bikes for the whole ten days so we were very flexible.",50,100

"We stayed here for 6 nights and it was perfect! Our room had everything we need to self cater, had comfy beds and a  big terrace. You can rent bikes as it's further out if town but still easily walkable, you need a bike to get to the beach but it's a nice flat ride through interesting streets. The owner was really nice and so were the staff giving us good reccomendations from when we checked in. The restraunt next door canoa is fantastic we went there   twice. There's lots of hammocks, comfy cushioned and sun loungers to relax in and they have a good menu for coffee juices, breakfast etc. I really enjoyed watching the colourful birds come to the window in the morning and there are humming birds also buzzing around which I love. We don't do yoga but there's also an amazing open",50,100

"Sonido del Mar is a beautiful little boutique hotel.  If you are looking for a serene, lush setting to relax and enjoy some sunshine this is it!      My room was lovely and very big.  A lot of thought obviously went into the layout of the room; the bed is in a cozy little alcove with lots of perfectly placed lights for those that like to relax and read in bed.  My room had its own private deck next to the yoga studio, which was awesome.  As a solo female traveler, all the extra security features of locking gates etc made me feel extra safe and able to sleep well at night.    The restaurant has some good breakfast options and great shakes/ juices.  The pool/ restaurant is beautiful and provides a very casual and relaxing area to hang out... There are a few hammocks to swing in.  ",30,100
"  Lastly, the yoga was amazing.  I had a couple great classes! Very different from the flow I'm used to, with tons of amazing modifications on poses I've done for years.  I also really liked hearing the class done in both Spanish and English.  The palapa itself is wondeful, there is usually a light breeze blowing through and rustling the wind chimes.     I would definitely recommend staying here, its a fantastic value!  I paid only slightly less to stay at Harmony yoga down the road and found Sonido del Mar to be world's better.  ",50,100

Nothing to use to clean up with after using the cooking facilities. Lazy staff. Room not cleaned for 3 days. Even after speaking to the staff who said they would fix it.

"I've never ever seen such a dirty and filthy place in my life, and probably won't in the future either... Our 1-night stay was also during the peak of Covid when the cleaning was supposed to be the number one thing, especially if the property promises that in the hotel info. Grease, dust, unwashed kitchen utilities, plates & glasses, dirty oven and micro wave, loaded laundry machine, full dryer, bird poop, cigarette ashes, left garbage, bacterias, dead insects, stained chairs, nasty toilet brushes, soap and tooth paste leftovers in both bathrooms... The list is so long and I took over 40 pictures as evidence. Just imagine dust balls and grease on the shelves in the fridge, then you might understand what I'm trying to explain. There is no reception so the management has given all",10,101

Unfortunately they don't accept complaints if you reserve your stay with agents, like hotels.com and they have zero tolerance whatsoever when it comes to settlement between the client and themselves. This is not a place that should be included in the Coco Family, their other hotels by the beach are totally lovely & great compared to this one up in Tulum City at the end of town.",50,101

The location is good, close to downtown and restaurants but still in a quiet place. We would always come back!",50,101

"Firstly, the apartment itself if absolutely fine.  Good size, clean and in a quiet location out of town. So the reason for my 1* review is not for that, but for misleading/dishonest marketing and the management response (or lack thereof) to my complaint.  When looking for somewhere to stay in Tulum we were deliberating between town and beach locations.  Coco Village seemed ideal - a town location but with ""free access"" to their sister property on the beach.  (Note, at the time of booking this free access was prominently mentioned as such on the main third party booking website of choice.  At the time of writing this review it has been changed to say 'this property has a private beach area' (although still doesn't explicitly say you have to pay to use it), but on their own",50,101
" website is still showing as free access - see picture).  On arrival, it transpired that free access actually means a minimum spend of 25 USD per person (since there were 4 of us, 100 USD seems quite a lot for a day at the beach!).  I understand why some beachside establishments will either have a minimum spend or charge for their sunbeds - my issue is not with this as a concept but the fact that the expectation set on booking is that there is no charge for residents.  I queried this with front of house (oddly, and impersonally, this all had to be done via WhatsApp).  At first they tried to wriggle out of it by saying the access was free because they don't ask you to pay for a day pass.  But no such thing as a day pass exists at this property for anyone - it is all about the minimum spend (in theory, the min spend for a non resident is higher (50 USD) but reviews on here would suggest this can be negotiated down, thus there is no benefit for residents at all).  Eventually, the lady I was exchanging messages with said she would pass my complaint on to management.  I never heard from them again.  So, our stay here was not as expected, and the management response to our complaint was very poor.",50,101
"We really enjoyed our two night stay here- it was just enough. The tents have air con & the whole glamping site is very pretty. Happy hours were a nice touch as we were running super low on cash due to travelling for 10 days prior. Staff were great & the sun loungers were so comfy. We loved having free entry to the beach club and living care free for two days! Only negative was the nachos, they weren’t fresh chips, and they were covered in the thickest refried beans ever, I wasn’t a fan of the beans, I couldn’t find a single chip without it on. I hate complaining but I asked if I could send them back and get some fresh nachos without beans, the guy said it wasn’t possible and that’s how they are prepared. Surely if they’re fresh you’d just melt the cheese and add the extras,",40,102
" without picking up the refried beans..? He said I could have something else and I said the burger. The burger was rock hard. I didn’t bother saying anything as the first time didn’t go down well. Anyway my point is, if you’re not happy with something it’s good customer service to take it off the bill, yet I paid for BOTH meals. I also saw other people leave full plates of nachos. Just something to take into consideration. Everything else was fine. The manager/ owner was super helpful with recommendations for the remainder of our trip too. Would recommend for sure!",50,102

The vibe is super relaxed, the music is perfect, the staff was incredibly nice and HAPPY HOUR(!). Yeah we’re totally sold. We’ve been to another beach club in tulum which was 4x as expensive and I wish we would’ve known about Cinco then. Perfect, you have to go!!",50,102

Shout out to Brett (one of the owners) for pulling up an extra little table for us when our food arrived. Him and his partners have clearly put a lot of love into this spot. Don’t miss it!",40,102
"Cinco is a small, relaxed beach club with fresh, delicious food (try the fish tacos and the homemade sorbet) and well-mixed cocktails that is in the relatively quieter north Beach Road area. There was chill music playing, but not the loud dance club music of other locations, so it made for a relaxing environment. We appreciated that we could make a reservation via their website -- definitely do this!! -- and that parking was available onsite. The service was attentive without being overbearing. We reserved a beach bunk, which we switched to beach chairs. They also have beach beanbags, but they seemed like they would have been hot for extended lounging. Beach towels are available. Minimum spend for a weekend day was $35/person, which seemed very reasonable and was easy to cover",50,102
" with lunch and drinks.   For people considering staying here overnight, I really enjoyed our day here, but I would not have enjoyed staying here overnight. The glamping tents looked nicely furnished, but were very closely spaced with limited privacy. I think it would be comfortable if you're just looking for a place to rest, but not the best choice for couples or if you are looking for quiet space.",20,102

"Cinco Tulum is a chill and beautiful place that can be visited as a beach club by day or ""glamping"" guest (which includes the beach club). During my 4 days in Tulum, I decided to spend two nights inland, followed by 2 nights near the ocean. I had never been glamping and chose this popular spot. Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the concierge, a delicious tropical drink, given a tour of the property, my tent, amenities and basic beach club rules/regulations. It's along the hotel zone, so it's nestled between other beach clubs/restaurants on a long strip of powdery white sanded beach. If you are looking to mingle, chill with friends or just people watch, then you'll enjoy this beach. It's quite active during the day, so you can reserve a lounge chair or bean bag, in advance.",50,102
"Loved my three week stay here. Very clean, spacious rooms and consistent air conditioning.   The breakfast isn't enormous, but its really lovely. I also loved the staff, they always took great care of me and really tried to communicate with my broken spanish.   The location is PHENOMENAL. Right by tons of great restaurants and halfway between the beach road and the La Valera area which is the other good spot in town. ",40,103

Arrival was done by a very friendly woman from Argentina and she helped and advised us the entire stay. Bikes are for rent next door and you need them to go to the beach. Public beaches are the best near to the park. On the hotel site is it to expensive and difficult to lay down. In this place we ordered breakfast each day in our room, but you can chose to eat it in the indoor garden too. Rooms are big and everything you need they provide.

Negative aspects: The service was basic and not kind. At the moment of our arriving, they only provided our keys and not explain anything about staying. The parking is beside the hotel but you need to go with your keys and open the big doors with a chain and lock on it, is totally unpractical. If you have a rented car think about it.

You have a place to leave the bikes without extra fees.   Also super good: soap, shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom.   Nice balcony for chill out.   Great location.

The room was very small compared to what was displayed online as well as the bathroom.   Before booking this hotel I had emailed the hotel and they had told me that bike rentals were included in our rate so we didn't have to worry about renting bikes, only  to find out that not only were there no free bikes but they didn't have any bikes available for us to rent. So we had to seek out another bike rental company.   Next BIGGEST issue was house keeping. Even though we had a do not disturb sign on our door, every day the housekeeping would ignore this and knock on our door while we are asleep asking to come clean our rooms. One day after",10,104

Hotel is clean, nice, walking distance to many restaurants, and I even walked from the beach twice (about 40 minutes depending on where).  My only complain was that on my last morning (the breakfast is the best I've had included in the fee) I had to leave the hotel at 8 am to go to Cancun airport, and breakfast started at 7:30am.  I had figured I had enough time to at least order coffee and fruit, but at the same time this group of 17 people were also expecting to have their breakfast.  That day breakfast was a bit delayed, and the group pretty much took over the whole thing and server's a cook's attention without them even leaving the",20,104
" kitchen.  I ended up leaving without anything and I was very unhappy on my hour and a half trip to Cancun without haven't had any coffee.  This is not the server's, cook's, or group's fault per se, but, the hotel is small, and for breakfast they can usually accommodate one order at a time.  If the hotel knows they are checking in a group of 17 people, couldn't they also make special arrangements for them to have breakfast at a certain hour?  I am pretty sure no one else in the hotel was able to get anything that morning.",40,104

Sits on an unfinished road. Aesthetically the venue is gorgeous and beautiful landscape however, it lacks considerably in customer service. There is no elevator. I had to climb multiple flights of stairs with multiple heavy luggage. The safe in my room was inoperable. My first day there was no electricity or running water for hours. I woke up in sweats. Hotel did not have backup generator. They did not offer bottle water to guest for no running water or comp the room for a night nothing. Didn't even bother to let the guest know. Not cool to wake up to no basic amenities. Also there is no noise",20,104
Very hospitable hosts who gave great recommendations for exploring the town and getting reliable transportation on a budget. Rooftop is beautiful! Could use a blanket on beds in addition to sheets. The cruiser bikes they offer were really accessible  and made for an awesome excursion day.,40,105
"I literally never write reviews. The staff at Casa Almendro went above and beyond to make sure my boyfriend and I were able to celebrate a special occasion in style. They clearly take a lot of pride in their work. The rooftop is gorgeous and the rooms are very comfortable. Excellent location, daily cleaning of rooms, and great service.",50,105
"Good value is difficult to find in Tulum. This is one such place. Well located. Very clean. Well equipped kitchen. The staff is nice & attentive and will help you to rent a bike if you need one.  Plenty of food options nearby and two cheap laundries. If I get a chance I will come back. I stayed in a basic room, no TV which worked for me. Bathroom small but functional. ",50,105
"Casa Almendro is a small, cozy and beautiful guest house, just a walking distance from tulum main avenue. Grocery stores, restaurants and food wagons are at a 1 minute walking distance.  The place is super clean. It has a beautiful roof with hammocks, tables and a shared kitchen with all the equipment that is needed in order to cook a meal. The rooms are perfect for 4 people and they even add one more bed for us no extra charge (we are five). The hosts are very helpful and kind and we would definitely love to come back one day!",50,105

"I spent lots of time finding the perfect place to stay downtown Tulum and I usually use Trip Advisor to make my choice but I’ve found this place on another website.  I don’t know why there is not more reviews on here because this place is just perfect! It was everything I was looking for.  First of all it is spotless, super clean.  The owner and the staff were retouching the paint the two days we were there. You can tell they put there hearts into this hotel.  Talking about the staff, everyone is friendly and the owner is really nice and helpful.  The rooms are big.  Not the much comfiest bed but it was big and clean. The hotel is well located like the other comment said, close to the main road but far enough thats its quiet.  It can still be noisy tho,  Tulum is a noisy town. ",50,105

I didn’t sleep the first night because dogs were barking next to the hotel and a rooster woke me up early morning but thats not the hotels fault.  There is air conditioning and a fan in the room so you have the choice which one you prefer.  What I loved the most about this hotel is the rooftop terrace.  It is so nice and relaxing with a nice refreshing breeze where you can escape the heat.  We spent our afternoon in the hamac and it was the perfect place to drink my coffee in the morning.  There is a kitchen with everything you need if you want to cook, put your beer, make coffee.  There is also bike you can rent for 100 pesos. Don’t hesitate to book Casa Almendro you wont be disappointed.",50,105

Amazing staff and owner. Local people to whom you can great conversations. The restaurant is also high quality and their staff is young and really trying to deliver a great service. Food is really good! Located on the main avenue of Tulum. It is basically on the end of the city coming from Playa del Carmen. So you can go to the center walking but still you're not at the center. To the nearest beaches by taxi takes around 15 minutes. Definitely a place we will return when we go to Tulum.",50,106

We also really enjoyed the breakfast and smoothies, they were very delicious. And also the owner and his stuff were extremly nice and friendly and helpful with tips for our stay in Tulum. I highly recommend Huaya Camp! ",50,106
"I got a recommendation to stay here, I was excited based on the photos. It's not as secluded as it looks in the photos, it's roadside with club music and traffic visible in the tents. They double-charged me for the room and I had to follow up for weeks (7 emails total) for them to finally reverse the charge. For the cost, there are much better places to stay in Tulum.",20,106
My boyfriend and I stayed at Camp Huaya in Tulum and had the BEST time! The grounds are darling and the yurts are even better! The cuteness is only matched by the loveliness of the staff! This includes Lalo (the camp owner) who is fabulous! He is so hospitable and has the best Tulum recommendations! We can’t say enough good things about this place! ,50,106
"The staff of this place is absolutely amazing. They are very willing to help you out in any matter. We wanted to rent a scooter and in 20 mins it was delivered to our doorstep. Next day we wanted to rent a car and it was delivered once again to our doorstep. Additionally, the rooms were clean and had an amazing atmosphere. Initially I was a bit anxious about staying in a yurt since I had never stayed in one before but once we arrived my worries were proven to be unnecessary. ",50,106
"If you are looking for a quiet romantic getaway - this is the spot.  We spend 3 nights in Huaya camp. The place succeeds in both generating that restful palm tree oasis feel, but at the same time looks both fancy and very stylish! The staff here will truly make you feel welcome, with hospitality beyond words. The in-house Kalu restaurant serves healthy and tasty food that will definitely make you feel happy and cosy. The staff is so attentive they even remember how you like your morning coffee. Lalo, the owner of the camp,  was amazingly helpful and provided us with lots of great tips and recommendations on what do to and where to eat, which made our stay in Tulum fantastic! If we ever are lucky enough to come back to Tulum we will surely stay here again!  ",50,106
"The Huaya Eco Camp Yurts is a nice and quiet oasis right along the big and bussie road crossing Tulum. This place turned out to be my hub for having most tasty breakfast, to meeting very nice people from all over the world, to enjoying awesome smoothies and to join great trips with Lalo to the surrounding highlights of Tulum. The personal was very friendly, vigilant und welcoming. I can only recommend this place to enjoy your time at Tulum!",50,106
"A charming little paradise in.the crowded and exciting town Tulum. The yurts are wonderful and very stylish... Showering under the stars is delightful! Ask the owner for a journey to the nearby lagoon and Maya ruins (or any other trip), if you're lucky he'll take a Maya guide with him... A great storyteller that knows the history and nature very well! And ask the owner to take you to his favourite fish restaurant for lunch afterwards...   It's not cheap but worth every penny!",50,106
Huaya camp is truly incredible! The vibes are so fun yet chill. The decor is perfect and I felt completely comfortable in every way. It is really heavenly! The food is amazing and so affordable. Great service- Lalo and Julio were so sweet and attentive! Amazing value and just one of the best experiences I’ve ever had!,50,106
"We spend 4 nights in Huaya camp!! The place looks really fancy and the tents are very clean and stylish decorated! The place is run by the most lovely team we ever had on our several travels around the world!! Lalo the owner of camp was amazingly helpful and provided us with lots of priceless tips and recommendations what do to and where to eat, which made our stay in Tulum unforgettable! If we are lucky to come back to Tulum we will definitely stay here again!  The camp comes with a small restaurant KALU & which serves healthy breakfast and lunch! The stuff is very attentive and friendly, they remember how you like your morning coffee ;)",50,106
"My husband and I just stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it. We went for our 3 year wedding anniversary and the hotel kindly put romantic flowers and a message on our bed which was very thoughtful. Beautiful and clean rooms... and a SUPER comfy bed. I’m confused about previous reviews on the breakfast because we thought it was great. It had a variety of eggs, bread, fruits, juice, cakes and jams. Delicious! And finally the staff were amazing, kind, polite, gave great recommendations on restaurants. Thanks! We really enjoyed it! Oh p.s the free bikes really helped our budget and being able to use their sister hotel Maria Del Mar was amazing, definitely check it out!",50,107
"Great place, no complaints about property. Staff very helpful trough stay. Pool is smallish but adequate for family. Free breakfast does not include egg or meat but made up for it with fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice, and different pastry every day.  Coffee was ok, not bad. Milk was good for family. I assume that the kitchen could be used for eggs etc. presuming we clean up after ourselves.  Room toiletries were of very good quality. Tv is a bit dated (tube) but worked well. Balcony is a little treat, not ideal for small children but nice chill spot.  We did not use the free available bicycles as we had 2 little ones. Taxi is approximately 40 pesos into town. It's a little off the main strip but I will come back and do recommend it. Solid mid quality clean and cozy. Well worth",40,107

"This small hotel was perfect for us. We had 2 rooms...one with 2 double beds for our 18 and 21 yr old sons, and one King for me and my wife. It was a great base for us as we spent the week enjoying Tulum. We had a car to get around the area, so that made it easy to get to and from town and also over to the main beach road, where the sister hotel and beach club was an ideal spot to relax. Very nice staff in both locations, they made us very welcome and comfortable. Even if we did not have a car, taxis are abundant and getting around is easy.",30,107
"We stayed for two nights at Luna Llena Tulum and was the worst hotel of all our journey through Quintana Roo.  Initially a hotel far from everything. We had car and it was still very far. The street of the hotel with many big holes and very difficult to use. We did not even check in and check out. Simply, the security guy gave us the room key and we never saw the reception girl.  Reasonable room. We stayed in the third floor. No elevator. Very difficult to take the suitcases to room. Small bed and bad. My brother was in a room with a shower next to the bed and the rest of the bathroom in the hallway outside the room. Very uncomfortable. Breakfast awful. There was no one to assist you.  The only positive point was that the Luna Llena guests could use , during the day, the Hotel",10,107

…,20,107
"Arrival/Welcome Staff: Superb. Enthusiastic. Friendly. Room: Very nicely decorated, nice space. Big window. Amenities: Lame pool area, no room to sit. No sun.  Restaurant: Breakfast included with the room is very basic. Almost 100% sugar-based items.  Location: Absolutely brutal. There are about 10 hotels under construction in the vicinity, it is loud from 7am until 9pm (non-stop). Not relaxing at all. Also, it is a good 25mins walk to the strip, there are barely any lights, and the roads are disastrous. Maybe in 10yrs when Tulum has grown even further, this would be a good spot but for now, probably best to avoid.  Others: Good Wifi. Free bikes. There was a very big and loud dog that lives in one of the apartments/rooms(WHY?? I don't know) and it barks pretty much 24/7. So",30,107
" between the 14h of construction per day and the 24h of loud barking, forget relaxing, forget sleeping well.   The Love/Hate --> This hotel is affiliated with a very high-end hotel on Tulum Beach, where any guests from Luna Llena can go spend the day. Private beach, gorgeous grounds, friendly staff. Superb perk... yours to decide what's more important!",50,107
"My Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pepem. We stayed in the Na-Ha Suite. It was even more beautiful than the photos! Upon arrival, we were greeted and checked in in a lovely check in area that is located next to the restaurant. All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. Quick to answer any questions we had. We were given a quick tour of our suite and then left to relax in the peace and tranquility of the jungle.  The suite had a full working kitchen with a large refrigerator. We had stopped on our way to the resort to stock up on breakfast and lunch foods as well as wine etc. If you enjoy cooking, there is plenty of space and supplies to do so.  The bathroom was very impressive. Loved the design and openness to the outdoors. There are mirrored sliding",50,108
" doors on all sides of the shower to provide privacy while still being able to view the outside from indoors.  The living area and bedroom were beautifully decorated and comfortable. They provided us a fan for sleeping at night. It was of course warm and humid but made bearable with the fan and keeping the glass doors open at night (there are screened doors to keep out bugs) for a nice breeze. We slept well all three nights.  We ate at the restaurant on two nights of our stay. The atmosphere is lovely and the service was very friendly. We loved everything we ordered both nights. Hats off to the chef!  We did find some insects inside during our stay, but this is to be expected! None of the insects we found were alarming or scary. We also found once baby lizard which we helped get back outside. The mosquitos were not as bad as I feared. I typically get eaten alive but I did not get bit at all. My husband got bitten maybe half a dozen times. However, we was not as diligent with the bug-spray. We found that the mosquitos were really only around at dawn and dusk but otherwise left us alone. We opted for an eco bug-spray called Incognito and it worked very well.  We were hoping to visit the local cenotes with the free bikes the resort supplies but we were still suffering the affects of a stomach bug we had picked up at our previous resort. We are planning to go back in a year or so to explore the area a bit more.  Thank you to all of the staff at Pepem for providing a relaxing and well thought out stay! We already miss it and want to return!",50,108

"Can’t say enough great things about Pepem. Me and my partner stayed with them in a jungle suite w pvt pool. And omg it was just perfect! In addition, the staff at the property (literally everyone) are the kindest and sweetest people ever. They made us feel at home since the moment we stepped in. The property is the core definition of boho chic, the restaurant is a must try - sea and land pasta and mezcalitas were our faves. There’s also always some events happening at the property that are very special, we had the pleasure of participating in a solistice liberation session. Only thing to keep in mind, you need a car if you’re staying here.",50,108
"Everything about this property was Simply perfect!    What surprise us the most was the quality of the food and the chef! His name is Martin and he managed to surprise us with delicious food every day. Before spending 4 nights at this location, we stayed 5 nights in Tulum (Hotel area) and tried several fancy restaurants and still the food at Pepem was the most outstanding!  I honestly think Martin should be considered for at least one Michelin  star ;) . The restaurant itself has a very cosy & tasteful decoration style!  We stayed at the suit entitled Pepem. The room is extremely spacious, the facilities were very clean, and the views of the jungle were breathtaking! There are glass walls facing the jungle. This gives you the sensation of space while you are still in a very",50,108
" private & safe environment.We visited this place in April 2022 and the weather outside was rather warm. This is an Eco Hotel and it does not have AC. However during the night it was very comfortable as we had two fans that we could use. We come from Denmark and prefer cold rooms when sleeping :) Two ventilation fans did the job and we had no problems sleeping.   There is also very beautiful mosquito cover we use during the night. However, we did not have any issues with mosquitoes as there were not so many. During the day we cooled  off in the very beautiful, private swimming pool.   If you do wish to visit the Cenote we recommend asking the reception for a private tour with Manuel Leon. He was amazing! He showed us private Cenotes and we were able to swim in places without any other people. The price for a private tour is the same as the price to enter one of the big cenotes with a larger group. The bigger Cenotes are also beautiful but they are very crowded!    We Will definitely come back to this amazing place!",50,108

"We loved our stay in Pepem eco hotel, it really exceeded our expectations and they were high! We slept like a babies,it’s so relaxing and the cabin was so beautiful and unique designed ,we really like it. Compare to all overpriced placed in Tulum especially zona hoteleria this place was cheap and worth every peso! The staff were extremely nice and friendly and the cook was professional who perfected every dish!  10+ from us!",50,108
"What a wonderful little place. We were lucky enough to stay in the family size Cabana for one night. Wish we could stay longer! It was so peaceful and everything was perfect and so beautifully done. There is no air conditioner, only fans, but the weather was great so it did not bother us. Dinner was available at the onsite restaurant. The food was delicious! Breakfast included homemade bread.  We followed directions on google maps and it had us drive on a road that is no longer used (glad we persevered and found Casa Mango!). So, do not take the first road left when you come from the direction of Tulum, take the second road left. There are signs for both roads. A very good value for money.

The fact that it is a little outside the center of Tulum is a fundamental fact for those who want to experience this type of stay. Something impossible if it were in an over-developed center.

The rooms are tastefully decorated in every detail. Built with original materials from the area. Luminous, equipped with mosquito nets, fans, comfortable bed, private bathroom and exceptional view.  The restaurant offers tasty dishes with homemade pasta, meat, fish and fresh vegetables. Delicious dessert are also available...  The owner is very helpful and will offer you various tips to enjoy the surroundings.  In conclusion, don't miss this opportunity!!",30,109

"While not easy to find, Casa Mango is well worth the effort, if you find yourself already staying in the area. While we did not stay there, we had several Italian dinners among the lush foliage, and the food is fresh, tasty, and good variety. (The wine is good too.) Affordable, unpretentious, yet romantic. The hosts are very friendly and genuine. What more could one want, deep in La Selva??",50,109
"We stayed at Casa Mango for 2 nights.   Hosts were extremely kind and resourceful and the grounds are beautiful, however the rooms themselves were less than satisfactory.   The sheets and towels were all damp, and the rooms were muggy with no air conditioning. They also were missing fans when we arrived (which they went out to get for us), but sleeping here was uncomfortable. Also, we had two rooms, and one of the rooms had a hole under the door which let in multiple spiders and had a drip for water pressure in the shower. Food at the restaurant was average, and the included breakfast was a lot of toast with a little bit of fruit.   Overall, this place has a ton of potential. Note to owner to invest in a few more air conditioners and a dehumidifier.",50,109

"Firstly, the location is simply perfect, TuboTulum is in the middle of everything. Walk outside, turn left, walk for about two minutes and you’re in the centre, enjoying Tulum’s plentiful restaurants and shops. The beach is only a 15-minute bike ride away. The tube room was bright, clean, and cosy. It was very simple but provided a very enjoyable and comfortable setting. The room was equipped with a a queen-sized bed, generous under-bed storage, air conditioning, curtains and lights, and a plug. Shared bathrooms were very clean and plentiful, I never had to wait for one to be free. I must say that the team of the hostel took great care of me. A delicious complimentary breakfast was served every morning with a hot cup of coffee. They’ve got a full kitchen, private rooms, bikes",50,110
" for hire, and really friendly staff who are always happy to help. I would be returning agan.",30,110
…,50,110
"Pros: Breakfast is decent for being ""free"" (apples, eggs which you can cook yourself, basic cereal and milk, coffee, sugar, white bread, marmalade, and butter). Free drinking water which has been pre-boiled and cooled. Shared bathrooms are spacious and pretty clean considering the traffic. I enjoyed the natural-like setting among urbanized Tulum. Just to the left is Ola Bike which is a major bike rental company in the area, very convenient! The hostel also rents out bikes but they only have like 2 or 4 so they are quickly gone. Definitely get a bike because it's a 15-20 minute walk into the main parts of town. Across from Chedraui grocery store which is convenient. Cute dogs and cat in the common areas.  Cons: Tubes are smaller than expected but the photos are pretty accurate in",50,110
" retrospect so maybe it was just me. There is only a tiny shelf inside that runs the length of the bed horizontally so your backpack and luggage will likely have to squeeze under the bed. It's pretty hot and muggy in the area so you have to blast the AC and be freezing (you only get a thin sheet for the bed, no real blanket), or put up with a humid room. No place to hang items dry. Lots of mosquitos on the property and I stayed in December so can't imagine how summer is like, but I saw other travelers hanging out in the open. Bring your own shampoo/soap/conditioner and towels for showering; there is a basket of shared amenities but this varies depending on the generosity of past guests.",50,110

"I first stayed at TuboTulum in April of 2018 and liked it so much I came back again this year!  The tube may be cozy, but it has everything you need for a good night's sleep: clean linens, storage space under the bed for all your suitcases and shoes, and a long shelf with plenty of space for your personal items (and an outlet to charge your phone/laptop!).  Breakfast is included every morning, and with a choice of cereals, toast, fresh fruit, juices, coffees and yogurt it's the perfect way to start a warm Tulum day.  The staff are welcoming and friendly, and overall it's just a really affordable, comfortable way to enjoy Tulum.",20,110
Very happy with this novel Tube experience . Owner was friendly and staff was very diligent.   Great filling breakfast and good hot water and crisp clean towels. Great A/C  All around good experience - kids loved it. ,40,110

"We booked a 6-bed for a week and the room was perfect in every way, the staff was extremely helpful, and the vibe of the whole place just helped set the mood for our time in Tulum. It was close to a supermarket, the city center, the highways to Chichen Itza and Playa Del Carmen, Playa Paraiso, a gas station, and the best restaurants we tried (which the staff recommended to us).",50,111

"Having scoured Trip advisor to find the best spot myself and a friend chose Maka Hotel and it did not disappoint. From start to finish we had the trip of a lifetime. We stayed for 11 nights and wish we could have stayed longer. We stayed in an XL room and it was fantastic - amazing vibe, extremely clean (towels and sheets changed everyday), and incredibly welcoming staff. The food served poolside and upstairs in the restaurant / bar area was fantastic. The hotel is in downtown (authentic Tulum with great spots to eat) and we travelled around downtown, and to both the public beach (beautiful beaches and ruins) and private beach (beach clubs / influencer territory) by bicycle which took around 20 mins. The hotel has parking for bikes and scooters and are happy to provide details",50,111
" for a tour company (To arrange trips like chichin Itza, cenotes, snorkelling etc).   To be aware: there is no full length mirror in the rooms if selfies are your thing. The hotel does have a hair drier and rooms are supplied with fresh towels and great hand soaps, shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Other reviews indicate the loud club music. It is true that the hotel plays music until 3am 3 times a week but as this is techno (without lyrics) I ended up finding this similar to white noise which was easy to sleep through. I wouldn’t change the club / music as that is what draws people into the hotel and is a great way to meet new people and adds to the vibe. Similar to this the hotel offers dorm rooms which is great to meet backpackers / solo travellers. If meeting people is your thing Che Hostel is a 2 minute walk away where there is a huge party vibe every day of the week. The pool at Maka does get some sun but isn’t exposed all day. We paid to use the pool (180 pesos spent at the bar) 2 doors down at mimosa when we were not at the beach/when the Maka pool was in shade.   Finally a huge thanks to Maka for looking after us and for contributing to such a life changing trip. A home away from home.",50,111

"I’ve stayed in the mixed dorm room for 3 nights! It was a mix of the best of a hotel and hostel, since the price was relatively cheap, but my bed was made everyday and I’ve received fresh towels daily. The dorm is well thought out, there are plenty of plugs, plus the beds have added privacy by curtains. The inner garden is also very relaxed and the whole hotel looks great. The staff is outstanding, everyone was very nice with me, but especially Mar at the bar downstairs. The Acai bowl they offer is one of the best in town.  Con: There is a bar on the rooftop with blasting music every day until 1 am. Since the room is just below it, sometimes even the walls were shaking from the bass. Personally it didnt bother me. I was sleeping like a baby with earplugs, but people more",50,111

"New hotel with great potential, but lots of little things that need to be improved to get things going. We booked a single night to check the place out and were told it's fully booked despite having booked through booking.com. We were able to make a deal as we intended to stay in a penthouse for 4-5 nights anyway, so they let us stay in their multi-room condo, which unfortunately wasn't properly prepared (not cleaned, coffee machine had a used filter in it, lots of mosquitos in the room, no coffee or water available) but we had a place to stay. We also used their gym on that day, and the gym is absolutely great for a hotel gym despite the fact that one machine is broken and there's no water in the gym although it was advertised. The next day, we moved to our penthouse, which was",30,112
" absolutely fabulous. Very nice rooms with lots of wood and generally a very nice design and style. On second glance, we realized that the cleaning staff is not yet as efficient as they probably will be soon (see pictures). Lots of dust, many things were forgotten (water refill, coffee refill, new towels in the showers were often taken away but not replaced, and there never was any hand soap at all throughout the entire stay) but we have to say that every time we told staff about one of those things, they immediately remediated the issue which was absolutely great. There was just a general lack of proactiveness. In both rooms we had (the condo and the penthouse) there was initially no hot water in the showers, which we learned could just be turned on by the management. Why it wasn't turned on despite the fact that our PH was rented the night before we don't know. Also, the private pool was only cleaned after we requested it - but then it was cleaned well and although the pump only runs two times a day for a couple hours, it stayed mostly clean through the day. Now the single most impacting issue we encountered was: power outages. Almost every day (4 days out of 6), there was no power due to construction work going on in the neighbourhood, and sometimes for up to 6 hours where you couldn't shower (pumps wouldn't work, so we had to clean ourselves in the pool before dinner in town once), use the toilet (!) or use Wifi or just charge your phone. Definitely not the hotels mistake, mind you but the way this was handled was very questionable. Sometimes we were told it would be for one hour, and after asking again four hours later they would say that the really had no clue (why say anything in the first place then?). One morning, the chef who makes absolutely great breakfast wasn't present. We asked the staff why (at around 8:20 AM) and were told that since there would be a power outage, he couldn't cook anyway. He usually arrives before 8 AM so they quite obviously knew already the night before that power would be out - no info to any of the guests. Again, it all boils down to how they handle things and communicate: they react well when being told about a problem, but there's absolutely no proactiveness and really poor customer service in the sense that they are not at all trying to compensate for the problems this new place in a new area with lots of construction working going on still has. They could have reduced room rates, provided free breakfast, or drinks to make things right, or simply have proactively and transparently communicated that there are still issues - none of which happened. Also the restaurant closes daily at 5 PM which advertised differently only (available for breakfast, lunch & dinner). We'd have loved to enjoy the great kitchen also in the evenings instead of venturing into the crowded town full of other tourists. The breakfast food and drinks made by Dani were absolutely great - our compliments to the chef. Staff recommended Tomato, an Uber Eats alternative, and that worked very well too. On our last day, we got a free late check out since our flight was only at 11 PM. What's tainting the granted late check-out is that we only got it after showing proof we left a 10/10 review on booking.com - a bit of a questionable business practice. But again, nice and helpful staff who tends to react well to minor issues, great hotel with potential but probably only in a few weeks or months when routine has kicked in.",10,112

Als wir bezahlen wollten, sagten sie uns, dass eine Überbuchung vorliegt und wir leider nur ein paar Tage bleiben können. Die größte Frechheit war, dass wir pro Nacht mehr Geld als vereinbart bezahlen mussten, da wir nicht so lange dort blieben.  Viel Stress und unnötiger Aufwand. Ansonsten war es sehr hellhörig und laut und die Zimmer haben gemuffelt.",50,112

"I can't say enough about my stay at Irie.  It far exceeded my expectations!  From my beautiful penthouse apartment, to the 5 star cuisine, to the all of the upscale amenities, and to the kind, attentive staff - if I could give 10 stars I would.  My penthouse apartment was fully stocked with all of the necessities. It was luxurious and clean with an authentic Tulum vibe.  I stayed on the jungle side of the hotel and had views for days of the beautiful lush canopy.  My apartment had a breathtaking rooftop terrace with an infinity pool that made you feel like you were relaxing right in the midst of the Tulum jungle - absolutely incredible.  I was able to order food from the on site restaurant that offers tons of vegan options.  The food was to die for.  I found myself eating almost",50,112
" every meal there because it was like eating at a 5 star restaurant.  The food was always beautifully plated and the menu had such diverse offerings. Bon appetite!  The amenities had me never wanting to leave!  The beautiful pool located right in the middle of the hotel property was so relaxing and chill.  Talk about feeling like you're on vacation!  The gym is a full service gym with every piece of equipment that you could possibly need.  Professional weight lifters would die for this gym.  But the most spectacular amenity in my opinion was the EPIC yoga studio on the top floor.  I am a yoga studio owner myself and I was blown away by the size of this studio and the tranquil, peaceful vibe it gave while practicing there.  I can't wait to organize a yoga retreat and come back to Irie.  The yoga studio bamboo window panels fully open up to the jungle canopy so you can feel the breeze in your hair and the sounds of nature while meditating or practicing with movement.  It was absolutely magical!  I am not one to write a review unless I am 100% called to do so, and this vacation blew me away.  The staff was amazing and so kind and helpful. I absolutely LOVED my time at Irie! If you are questioning whether this is the hotel for you, just book it.  You will not be disappointed.",50,112
Someone that works there with the keys for the rooms went through our stuff while we were out and stole money from our luggages.  Management denied.  We lost 200 pounds.  Don't book this place. There is no safe in the rooms and apparently cleaning services like to check what's going on in your belongings. ,10,113
"Clean, safe, squared-away hotel. Friendly staff. About two blocks from ADO and tons of food options. Good bed, TV, Wifi. But, nothing special. Hard pressed to come up with 200 words...but, getting there.",30,113
"This is a OK budget hotel.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff are friendly enough and it's only 2 blocks from the ADO terminal and half a block to the main street and collectivo stop. Shower was good and had enough place for your clothes and bags.  Downside was the internet which stopped out often till they reset it then it worked better. The curtain was see through which could be easily fixed but meant no real privacy at night and there was no option fur breakfast so you had to find somewhere else in town for that and early in the morning there's not many options  I'd stay there again but the above issues could easily be fixed even at the expense of a few extra $'s.",30,113
"Yes, it has hot water. Pressure is a tad low. Clean place, but do not plan to pay with a credit card, as they are not set up to accept cards unless you used a credit card to guarantee the room. Then they will defer to that payment.. Price is OK. They advertise free parking. Yes, that is kind of true, as the parking is in front on the city street if you can get it. The area is a dimly lit side street. Beds are fine. Do not expect a Holiday Inn or even a Motel 6. This is pretty much your entry level place. Good folks., There are a few places to eat up and down Main street. You will appreciate US Hotels afterward, but there were no pests or dirt. Would we stay here again? Welllll.... maybe after looking around more.",30,113
"My family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms at the Posada Malix Pek recently on our way through to Mahahual. It was a little hard to find and not in the best looking neighborhood. I was concerned when we pulled up to the place at night, but I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the room. Very clean and recently updated rooms. Nice, comfortable beds and very nice bathrooms with great showers. It was all we needed for 1 night. I will say that the staff is not very friendly, but the man on duty did help with our luggage. The location is convenient for walking to restaurants and shops. We were able to pay with a credit card the morning of check out. I would stay here again if I needed a place in Tulum for a short stay!",40,113
"For the price this place is fine. Don't expect anything fancy. Super basic. But the wifi works and the place feels safe. Right near an amazing taco place, which is right on the main street. For a low price for a night or two this place is fine. ",50,113
"After waking around for 2 hours, we found this great little hotel on a side street, we thought we went to heaven it's so clean and the staff is very friendly and again a little bit of noise at night but if it's the only bad about this place it's not that bad, would love to stay there again when visiting the region",50,113
We stayed 4 nights after a horrible hostel experience in Tulum and it was just what we needed. REALLY clean and the WIFI is running fast. Also the staff is amazingly friendly and A/C is working good. The location is perfect. It’s not on the main street so not loud and you have all the restaurants by 5 minutes walk.,50,113
"I stayed here with my wife for 10 days. Rooms are very clean and well maintained, with plenty of space. Location is great, near ADO bus station and great taco place.  Personel was very kind. Overall, we had a wonderful time here.",50,113
"A great place to stay in town- wonderful food (think tacos tacos tacos) right on the corner. Room was large and comfortable. It was the perfect home base for our Tulum trip. Lots of places to rent bikes nearby and just a 20min bike ride to a beautiful, perfect, not crowded public beach.",50,113
"I enjoyed the interaction with staff, smiling and kind people, all three who were at the reception when I was there.  The room was simple, and most important, clean.  I struggled with my sleep though, because of two reasons: There was a lot of noice from outside, as the tiny window was facing the busy street. But there was no glass window, just a mesh, which made it worse. Also there was some water noise running constantly from the pipes, like the toilet upstairs was being flushed constantly.  Should it not be for this I would give the maximum rate, cause it's great value for money, and within their reach to fix for the future the things I mentioned. ",40,114
"I actually didn't stay a the hotel , as I became sick and ask them for the cancellation. They gave me full refund, though it was las t minute cancellation. This is the indication that they are very good.",50,114
"We stayed here for 5 nights and had a basic room, double bed with aircon. The aircon worked fine and the room was small but enough. A small window to the outside and a bigger facing the hall outside. If you're claustrofobic this CAN be an issue, especially if you get one of the room where all the windows only facing a corridor. It's a little bit of feeling being inside a cell... because of this a few paintings on the walls hadn't hurt to make it feel more ""cozy"".   The door to the toilet was broken and wasn't possible to close completely. We asked this to be fixed but nothing ever happend. We also missed having somewhere to ""hang"" as the room only had one chair. The main entrance has a big room - put in some sofas there and let people staying at the hotel get to know each other",30,114
" or just relax outside the room a little bit!   The staff was very friendly but didn't seem to know so much about the area, this would be awesome as well to improve! The hotel is very close to the ADO station and is located near to almost everything you need - except for the beach ;)",30,114
…,40,114
"This hotel can now be booked under the name of ruta del sol. I stayed here a couple of nights and had a good stay. The location is great in central Tulum and just a few steps from the ADO bus station . The employees are very welcoming and please to help you out with just info or tours.   The WiFi is perfect and available in the whole hotel.   The room is big enough and the bed sleeps fine. My room had ac and a ceiling fan. The latter was for me enough though.  Room is cleaned every day and also new towels if you want.   Shower is good, but not always warm water. Fine though since the outside temperature is pretty warm.  The toilet was a bit so so since it was loose. The bad thing about the bathroom was the smelly water, especially from the sink and the toilet.   I had good",40,114
"Este hotelito trae toda la onda! El cuarto esta muy lindo, la cama super cómoda, el roof tiene la mejor vista del atardecer, ademas la ubicacion es excelente porque se encuentra caminando de bares, restaurantes y beach clubs. Lo mejor de todo fue la atencion de todos, Dante es el mejor host! No duden en hospedarse aqui, es una excelente opcion calidad-precio.",50,115
"First time staying here, further down the strip on the quieter end. Set back from the road. No sign from the street so you need to know where you are going. it's located where you see the LOCO TULUM restaurant. Very large rooms, large bed and bathroom, and small rooftop dipping pool. On the Jungle side, the rooftop has a beautiful view of greenery for miles. doesn't feel like you are at the beach anymore. Jungle vibes. Attentive staff, Ac only in the evenings but ceiling fan helped. Clean room, lots of outlets, easy walk to beach. Only downfall is we didn't get clean towels on the second day and I'm not sure if that was an eco friendly thing, or if we were supposed to request them... But not a deal breaker.",50,115
"Festejamos el cumple de una amiga y decidimos pasar dos noches en Sunset. Es un lugar agradable, la habitación era muy limpia y las camas muy buenas para el descanso, después de una noche de celebración.  La hamaca en el balcón hizo mi dia La azotea es excelente para relajarse, ver una hermosa puesta de sol o disfrutar de la piscina. El lugar está cercano a varios bares y restaurantes. Y la playa está a sólo 50 metros, se puede entrar por el Club de Playa Dos Ceibas. Recomendado!!!",50,115
"Justo lo que esperas de una estancia en Tulum, dormir en medio de la jungla, siempre limpio y uno de los pocos lugares con aire acondicionado. La cocina tienen todo lo que necesitas, siempre disponibles con la atención. Súper recomendable.",50,115
Nos encanto este lugar muy bien decorado limpio nuevo con gusto muy bien ubicado en mediodía la jungla y dos pasos del hermoso mar de Tulum también tienen restaurante en el frente y cuenta con estacionamiento y tiene picina que decir genial lo recomiendo 100%,50,115
Estuve de vacaciones con mi esposo y pasamos unos días maravillosos . Super buen trato todos muy amables en especial el gerente del hotel el sr. Andres el hotel super bonito cómodo instalaciones limpias esperamos volver pronto y pasar otros días increíbles.,50,116
"We did a girls birthday trip to Tulum and stayed at Tuluna. There was plenty of space and it was clean. But most important was the free drinks by the pool! We had a great time cause the staff was so nice and welcoming. We left with warm hugs. Thank you Jose, Bryan, Ilse, Isma, Oscar, Claudio, Mr. Security Guard, all the waiters, and everyone else.",50,116
"A wonderful place to stay - safe, clean, serviced every day, beautiful rooftop pool, great sunset views, clean kitchen and lovely showers, very friendly and helpful staff. Sofia and Rosalia were so kind and lovely. I injured my hand after a scooter accident and they were brilliant ensuring I had all the care I needed.",50,116
"Beautiful stay visiting our friend. Such a magical place to be. Thank you to all of the staff including Sofia & Rosalia, they we’re brilliant, so helpful. Would absolutely come back! The roof top was absolutely wonderful for the sunset and the apartment was fabulous.",50,116
Stayed here recently and had a lovely time. Perfect for long stays in Tulum with access to the sister hotel facilities you’ve got the best of both - having your own personal apartment with access to hotel facilities next door. Lovely staff and security.,50,116
"Una estancia muy agradable, el departamento es muy lindo, parece muy nuevo, las camas bastante cómodas, la cocina tiene todo lo necesario. El roof del edificio tiene un área de descanso con hamacas que recomiendo ampliamente para ver los atardeceres. La ubicación, a pesar que no está en la zona de playa considero es buena, pues en bici o en auto son alrededor de 10 min de las playas, bares y restaurantes.",50,116
"Amazing place, very peaceful, SAMs attention and tips were amazing, Good place to do yoga and drink a juice in the rooftop.  ill be back in december.   pregunten en el desk por los tours, ellos tienes contactos y conocen a toda la gente del pueblo.",50,117
"The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and awesome! The environment was very sociable. The bathrooms & showers were great- The breakfast was delicious and right on the rooftop. Location was great! Not a very far walk from the bay or local shopping. They also rent bikes.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this hostel & I would stay again.",50,117
"The place is okay, but there are a few drawbacks. Its like there's more staff than guests, and they seemed more interested in having a good time themselves than in their guests. The bikes they rent aren't in good condition. The breakfast was 30-40 minutes late - even though we asked 2 times if it was gonna be on time (we had plans for the day that we needed to get to). The morning coffee was pretty weak, but if you buy a barista one it's really good.",30,117
"Lovely laid back hostel with comfy beds, clean rooms and pretty out door spaces/rooftop bar. Water refills available for 5 pesos. Breakfast is different every day but not buffet style and small portions",40,117
"Good all round Hostel. The rooms were clean, bright and spacious, especially the 6 bed dorm upstairs.   The wifi was good, the breakfast was really tasty and a decent size + coffee. And so nice having it on the rooftop.  My only complaint is that the lanyard/key chains they give you with the room key and bike lock key we’re absolute filthy dirty. They are a fabric and baby blue, hanging up in reception and it looks really unprofessional having them so dirty, it’s also really unhygienic.   This is a nice chilled out hostel and is good value for money.  Other than that, would recommend!",50,117
"We had an amazing time in the hostel. The beds were comfortable, the facilities clean and there's a very relaxed atmosphere in the hostel. The day after we left they opened a rooftop café and I know i'll have to come back one day to try it out. If I'm in Tulum, I'll stay here.",50,117
"Paid twice the price than Cancun and Merida, unfortunately, this is the only one did not provide complimentary towels, which is the least worry here. I was placed in an all-female room and received hostile female gazing as they claim this should be a female dorm rather than a coed one, which is the administration's fault obvs. During my stay, the showing curtain rod is on the floor, report to the desk right away yet no one cared to fix even after my departure.",20,117
"Casa Tzalam is an amazing, very special place. The hosts are incredible people. The hotel is beautiful, lots of comfort, amazingly good value for the price. You get a perfect accomodation, delicious breakfast, great pool, beautiful garden. The tab water is so clean and not salty (as it is in many other hotels in Tulum). Since Casa Tzalam is in the jungle you have fresh jungle water, warm shower, no mosquitoes, perfect a/c in the room. I recommend to have a rental car to get to the lodge. However, you will need a rental car in Tulum anyway, because the taxi prices are crazy high. And the distance from town to beach and the sight seeing attractions are big. So you should definitely rent a car (it's cheap and easy to get around in the area by car, even without a GPS).  Casa Tzalam",50,118
 is a 5 star accommodation! A life changing experience.  I hope to have the chance to return to Casa Tzalam someday!,50,118
"First time in Mexico, read a lot of negative stuff before coming regarding safety in this area. Our experience was the furthest from that.   Amazing place, hotel was very nice, clean, all staff and service has been 10/10. Food was very nice, breakfast included was always top quality and meals in the restaurant were also to this high standard.  For anyone worried about safety in Tulum; we dont drink alcohol so easy for us to avoid bars/clubs & nightlife. We were never out when the sun had gone down as the roads are v dark to drive safely on. We saw nothing that made us feel uncomfortable despite reading a lot of horror stories. You are safe at Alea as it is 15min drive away from downtown and has its own secure location out of the way.   Special thanks to Rafael and Pedro for",50,119

"We found this lovely place  on our way back to the airport CUN to catch our flight back to Europe! So friendly, helpful staff and nice atmosphere. Unfortunately we only had time for breakfast, but time we plan to stay there. Conny and Rodolfo",40,120
"The hotel has the perfect location to visit Cobá Ruins, the colonial city of Valladolid, Tulum, and beautiful cenotes. A new hotel, simple, comfortable, very clean, local staff very friendly. A walk distance from local craft shops and little restaurants in Francisco Uh May, a real Mayan town. Highly recommended!",50,120
"What a beautiful hotel! Everyone was so nice, rooms were so clean and nice decor. The pool was so refreshing and breakfast was delicious and they also have a menu for additional items if you want. The A/C in my room was amazing so cool after coming back from a hot day. Hasta la proxima Tulum",50,121
"Great hotel, modern and spotlessly clean. We stayed 6 nights on honeymoon and it was a great base for Chitzen Itsa, jungle tour, siam Ka'an and the beach. Location is 2min walk from the strip and right beside a subway and shop which was handy for snacks for trips. A+",50,121
"It’s on a great location,walking distance to the center. Many shops and restaurants close by. Close to the cenotes and the beach. New hotel,very clean and very cozy. The only thing I didn’t like was the breakfast,that’s why it is 4/5.",40,121
"Modern hotel, friendly staff with off road parking.   Small pool and seating area.  WiFi is per room so you lose this if go upstairs for breakfast, which is very basic.   Only a couple of blocks walk from bars and restaurants.   Good location for Tulum ruins. ",40,121
"We loved our stay at muyu, it was very close to the town centre and main Street. Was also very close to the road where cenotes are located. Included breakfast was good and the owner went above and beyond to make sure everything was fine with our room. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. ",50,121
Stay away at all costs! I had to cancel reservation due to COVID restrictions change and they refused to provide me with a voucher to use when I could actually visit. Also they charged me more and had to get my money back from booking.com. Terrible experience. I also read later that there is very loud music from the clubs nearby and you can't sleep. Ended up loosing my money and booking another more expensive hotel to have a positive experience.,10,122
"It was a fraud, they charged me 5% extra for my credit card, no AC and they tell me afterwards. Customer service 0 and I spent an hour explaining the situation and in an hour to other customers were complaining. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL, please. No one should stay here. I went to another hotel and I didn’t get my money back :(",10,122
"This place is decorated with Balinese furniture, Good A/C, the Japanese restaurant inside is nice . By the way , also the Argentinian receptionist was so friendly and made you feel like home, which is nice ",50,122
"We stayed a Casa Colonial the last week of February.  It’s a gem on the main avenue in Tulum. It’s very clean, quiet & has a peaceful atmosphere. In our room there was a packet of earplugs which had me concerned. I used them each night  & slept well. My husband didn’t and he said he heard music from a club during the night but it wasn’t enough that he needed the earplugs. The hotel staff and security were very friendly & helpful. Hoping to get a room here on my next trip in a couple of months.",50,122
"The shower was cold, with no pressure. The Wifi wasn’t working at all during our stay. One night, the AC broke in all rooms of the hotel cause of an electronic device. Our room neighbor had the exact experience with the shower and the wifi. Do not go to casa colonial. It would be a mistake.",10,122
"Is the best option forever, i like it so much the pool and the rooms. Perfect i go with my husband and we love this hotel. Thank's for the best aniversary. So the food of the restaurant is delicius and healthy. The coffee in the morning and mojitos in the nigth, is close the center and the bus station.",50,122
"After staying at the beach we decided to stay few days in Tulum center . This is a  nice  friendly hotel , good  beds , outdoor pool, nice vintage decor, very clean , good breakfast ( included) in a nice open air patio . Very conveniently located on the main avenue , few steps from the bus terminal and lots of choices of restaurants nearby . Front desk helpful on what to do and how to get around town and assisted kindly  with our personal needs , a great choice in Tulum.",50,122
"Casa Colonial is in the city center. Great location to stay with Tulum shopping and restaurants with in 10min walk. The hotel doesn’t have breakfast buffets but the menu is good and tasty, next to the hotel is two great choices for breakfast. There is a bike rental 20m from the hotel. The beach is 20-30min bike ride away. Hotel staff is friendly, hotel is clean. Recommend to stay or go for dinner/ breakfast when in Tulum. ",40,122
"The rooms are furnished with the very bare minimum (one bed, one small table, one small closet and nothing else), the only window available has a view on the inside garden so you have to keep it closed and it feels like you are in a room in the basement.  But that will quickly be the least of your concerns as the place is located just above a nightclub which blasts techno music until 5AM, so almost impossible to get any sleep.  We stayed one night and then left immediately and had to argue for hours with staff to get a (partial refund), so save your money and go somewhere else",10,122
"A newly renovated hotel with space for improvement. First of all we were asked a deposit of $600 which had not been mentioned in Booking.com and it was a bit of a hassle to recover as it was not deducted from the full payment requested upon our arrival. First shower I took when we arrived I almost burnt myself since there was no more cold water in the hotel’s cistern as we later found out. The WiFi was poor and did not work in all areas as advertised. The worst factor in this hotel though is that it is super noisy. In its patio, where there is the pool, there is also the restaurant El Patio which plays music till 11 pm or longer. Then, every night at 12 am the disco KIKI across the street starts playing some kind of AWFUL banging music till 5 am!!! Very hard to sleep! Breakfast",30,122
We stopped by the restaurant on our way back from Taak Bi Ha based on a recommendation from our tour guide. The ceviche and shrimp tacos were amazing. They were served with a delicious garlic sauce and a spicy habanero salsa.,50,123
"We are a family of 4 with 2 small kids and we spend around a week on this hotel and we are very happy with it.  It is located right next to the best cenotes on the area and it is quite easy to find.  Room are quite clean and spacious, beds are comfortable. Tv has cable and there is quite good space to store all your clothes. Breakfast is yummy but simple,  You can choose between 5 options and all include a juice or a coffee. Service is quite good, Daniel gave us a lot of tips for us to walk around the area. They were also kind enough to do laundry for us and the cleaning lady came and explained me the process to ensure no clothes loose their color on the process.  Our kids loved the small pool, just make sure if you go at night use repellent  as the mosquitos go around the pool",50,123
 at that time . We will come back !,50,123
"My wallet disappeared,we were looking for it until we found that one of the RECEPTIONIST HAD THE WALLET IN HIS ROOM ??  His excuse was he was keeping it for us, but...he did not accept he had it until we asked him several times. The story does not finish here, the bank called has that we had been charged 5 times more for the night. $500 for a stinky noisy room? NOT recommend this place AT ALL!",10,124
Right so we were lucky enough to find emotion hostel as it’s location is fabulous but is tucked in between a souvenir shop and an Italian restaurant. We were met by Marco one of the managers who was friendly and helpful throughout my entire stay. Staff were always happy to go above and beyond and their ability to speak several languages proved helpful to us and other travellers. The deco is unique. The rooms are absolutely fine and there is tv and ac. The bathroom is tired looking but again worth what you’re paying for and there is hot water. I want to say a huge thank you to all of the staff especially the Italian managers and the Colombian member of staff who also helped us throughout our stay.  I didn’t eat breakfast from the hostel only because it did not appeal to me. If,50,124
" there is any room for improvement it would be breakfast. I recommend that breakfast is not included and that is charged separately whilst the breakfast menu to include fresh juices, fresh bread, fresh butter etc.   Also the members of staff know a lot of the sellers, tour guides etc so they will always point you to the right direction or facilitate tours for you.  Cheapest bike hire in Tulum too!   I will be back for sure! Thanks again!!!    Lots of love,  Mimi x",40,124

"The hostel had some interesting characters but for the most part my stay here was very pleasant and offered showers, washrooms etc. The beds were comfortable and room was very clean upon arrival. The wifi struggled at somepoints however the communal spaces had good wifi. The staff were simply amazing and helped me to schedule a tour to Chichen Itza which was great. The breakfast was very minimal but filled the void.",30,124
"Unfortunately, we didnt have a nice staying while in the hostel. My friend and I arrived very late at night and after checking in we asked to use one of the lockers near the reception. The following day when we were about to leave my friend checked her wallet that was in the locker and all her money was gone. There were two holes there which one of them was connected to the toilet of one of the guest room. The owner, Antonio asked for one of the employees to fix the locker right away, after showing us videos from the security camera, . He was very positive about the robbery and basically blamed the couple in the room, showing us their names, where they were from and telephone number. He told us he would talk to them as soon they were back to the hostel. He offered us to stay",40,124
" there for free for a few days, but of course, we didnt want to due to what had happened plus the place itself was dirty, filthy and with a very bad vibe. We left and when my friend started to talk to Antonio through whatzapp he was a completely different person questioning if we really had that money there and told us he could do nothing about it and even made a sarcastic joke saying we could go the public ministry. It is a shame such behavior  as the hostel has totally responsibility for such thievery.",40,124
…,50,124
"A bit overpriced for what it was, but at the time I was in Tulum, the only thing left. A lot of noise from the bars at night and a little run down, but the staff were very helpful and friendly and also cheapest place to rent a bike I could find. Breakfast was pretty underwhelming too.",50,124
"We spent 3 nights here and it was excellent. The rooms are basic, so too the breakfast, but you aren’t paying top dollar so it’s alright. We received an email from the hotel a few weeks before our staying informing us about a party they were hosting on our final night. We asked for a quieter room in advance and they have us the room furtherest away from the party without guaranteeing peace and quiet. It turned out to be ok. We still heard the party but it wasn’t too bad. The staff are super chilled and friendly, making Emotion Tulum a good choice!",20,124
"The location is perfect (in between the beach and town).  We were not there just for the beach, we were in Tulum for the Mayan Ruins and especially the Cenote's and good food so our location was absolutely perfect. The beach is extremely expensive and the road to get there and back is always VERY congested.  By staying at our location we got 3 times the room for a third of the price.  We did have dinner at the sister hotel one of our nights and having the beach access is important because there is literally NO beach access without going through one of the hotels.  Elena and all at the front desk are lovely --- charming, fun and extremely helpful. We absolutely loved our room and balcony with a shower outside.  They serve absolutely delicious Italian and local Mexican coffee in",50,125
 the room (you will not be disappointed).  We will absolutely stay here again.,50,125
…,50,125
The hotel is very clean and the staff are very pleasant. I had the family room which is great and has a lot of space. Would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in tulum who wants to detach. Can get taxi into town for around 150 peso and to the beach for 300 peso,50,125
"My first trip to Mexico was to Tulum, the not so sleepy hideaway 90mins south of Cancun. We stayed in town at Alma de Flores. This hotel was great, perfect location and not too expensive. The area has a lot of construction but it didn’t distract from the relaxing vibes.   The hotel had a great pool and wonderful service. Always helped us get a taxi and arrange travel. Only downside is no restaurants or stores within walking distance (have to drive 10mins or bike 8mins... would be like 45+ min walk)  They have bike rentals but are limited, can find plenty of shops to rent from in town.   The hotel has a sister hotel on the beach in the beach zone, you get access to their beach club and pool which is an added perk.   10/10 recommend this place for a getaway to Tulum!",50,125
"Stayed at this wonderful hotel for vacation for 11 nights. Great staff and awesome rooms, garden and pool. You have free beach club access at the sister hotel Alma Tulum, drinks are served to the beach, prices great. We were greatly aided by Luis and Alain in reception and Moo and Carlos at the restaurant (both in the mornings and at the beach club).  Visitors should note that the hotel is located outside the town and the beach area in a new real estate development. For getting around, budgeting taxi or rental car cost is advisable. If I recall correctly, the town is about a 5-15 minute drive (150-200 peso taxi) and the beach club 20-30 minute drive (250-350 peso taxi). We used many taxis and this did not take anything away from the experience.  Highly recommended!",40,125
"My husband and I spent two nights in the Chit Panoramica.  Beautiful room, excellent breakfast, perfect cleaning and a very kind staff.  The hotel is surrounded by green and plants; it is not in the center but in the Aldea Zama area, therefore far from the confusion of the Pueblo.  All very relaxing!",10,125
"Came to Tulum  for the 2nd year in a row for my daughter's 26th birthday.We stayed at Alma de Flores for 1 week and we loved it!   The people at the desk were friendly and helpful! Breakfast was free in the morning and was  very good! You could rent bikes for 200pesos (24 hours) and they were very nice. Rode to the beach and downtown. The first night we checked in we decided to ask the cost of upgrading to a suite. Cost was $60more FOR THE WEEK!! We had much more room and our own private pool, it was delightful! We really enjoy Tulum and  feel very safe there, although many Americans will warn you that its not!!  Give Tulum a try!  Beaches are fantastic! Food is incredible! We like to be active so we choose not to  stay on the beach,but the great thing about this hotel is it",50,125
"the positives :  Nice pool Well located  in the city Easy to park  The negatives   Where to start …  The immediate vicinity is not very glamourous When we arrived the person at the reception was really really confused, it took ages to get the check in sorted  No soap and shower gel in the room  No basic amenities ( toiletries) No water bottle in the room  You can ear the neighbours in the room next door  We were only separated by 2 wooden doors The smell of the room when we entered  was horrible, the room smelled stale The safe was very hard to access  as it’s on the floor  The add mentioned a kitchen but we didn’t see it   Overall : tulum is very expensive and you get what you pay for, I am sure we could have found better for 65 usd a night  I am happy we stayed there only 1",20,126

"We stayed here for 9 nights the end of January through the beginning of February. The place was really nice and we enjoyed it. However, the online amenities listed and room types were all mixed up so what we thought we booked and what it said in all of our conformation emails was different from what the hotel had on file. We had to pay an additional 500.00 US dollars to get the room we already booked. We then had to argue for hours with the website for that to be refunded. You cannot reach the hotel by phone only email. Staff was friendly, it was clean, beautiful, and welcoming. Would I stay again? Yes - JUST BE SURE YOU KEEP A COPY OF EVERYTHING!!!!",50,126
"We stayed at this place with 2 kids because the location is very close to the city centre and it has kitchen. Although the general of house is clean, kitchen was dusty. I needed to wash everything before use. The pool is a bit small but our kids loved it. Silent place, staff was very helpful. Thanks for the juice and chips!",50,126
"We were looking for a simple place to explore Tulum and, in Villas Akalan, we definitely found it. The hosts were incredibly helpful, directing us to the best beaches and nearby cenotes and being nothing but friendly and accommodating. The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable. Try to go for an upstairs room so you have the evening sunset. Only thing is that it is necessary to have a car since the beach and main access to the restaurants in Tulum are a few miles away but there are some nice restaurants within walking distance too.  Overall highly recommended. Definitely worth stopping here for a few days. We didn’t want to leave!",50,126
"This place is so beautiful, I just stared at it for a while when I first got there. Beautiful luscious trees and flowers all around which make you feel like you are in a little piece of paradise. The villa was big, comfortable and it immediately felt like home. The pool was great and I loved spending time there. The location is literally perfect. You are right in the center but on a quiet street so it is a great little retreat from all the action. You can rent bikes to ride around the center and go to the beach. This place is right off the main street that takes you directly to the beach. Definitely recommend!!! So worth it!!!",50,126
"SO RECOMMENDED :) We had an amazing time in the beautiful Villas Akalan. So beautiful spot. Cool and helpful service. Right in the center with bikes available. The pool is amazing and we had it for ourself the whole time. Totally recommended. Beds are comfy, water is hot. I was able to sleep like a baby my whole stay. Enjoy amigos!",40,126
"Great location and great staff! The location es very good because it is a walking distance from shops, retaurants, grocery shopping, etc... and a short bike ride away from the beach. Rooms were clean and well furnished.",50,126
"A small and peaceful place near the center of Tulum. Excellent location close to the road to the beaches. A beatiful little garden with a refreshing pool, nice and helpful staff. Perfect for a family of five with grown up youths.",50,126
"The place is a little gem hidden in the busy Tulum  streets.  It’s quiet, the room is very big, it has everything you need inside! Each room Ba sits private balcony.  Our kids slept in the mezzanine and loved to have their own little area.  The beds are super comfortable (and I’m a difficult one!). The pool is a big bonus as Tulum is very hot and only beaches.  Better to rent a car and move around with the car.  Private parking available for free.  There is absolutely everything next door: amazing breakfast places, beautiful trendy restaurants, supermarket, bars etc.  The owner, Ali, is amazing. He’s friendly and really care about his guests. He gave us the best tips about Tulum, without him it wouldn’t have been the same. We even had a dinner together with him and the family! ",50,127
" You can even rent the whole place and privatise it if you are a big group, price is super affordable for the quality!  Next time in Tulum I will return at Alicat villas!  Thank you Ali!!",50,127

"El lugar es super agradable, tienen buena ubicación, el trato es muy amable, la pasamos de lujo, nos divertimos muchísimo, la piscina el ambiente de cabañas, además todo super limpio impecable, me encantó super recomendado. Si vas a visitar tulum y son varios amigos o parejas esta increíble, incluso si lo rentas en familia. ",50,127
"Las instalaciones son perfectas, un lugar limpio, confortable y caminando a su alrededor puedes encontrar muchos restaurantes, sin duda volvería a repetir la experiencia Alicat. Las habitaciones cómodas, fui con un grupo de amigas y sin duda es el lugar perfecto para hospedarse, la pasamos de maravilla.",50,127
"Fui con mis amigos, visitábamos el sur de México, en un viaje desde España. Conocimos Cancún, Playa del Carmen, algunos pueblos más y por último Tulum. Queríamos un ambiente privado y tranquilo. Encontramos Alicat Villas, como un sitio increíble. Muy cerca de las ruinas de Tulum que queríamos visitar. Cerca del centro también y de todos los sitios de marcha jeje. Y lo mejor el precio, para como está todo en Tulum, es de lo mejor que se pueden encontrar precio-calidad.  Es un sitio en el que estuvimos mejor imposible. Las cabañas son de lo mejor, tiene zonas comunes, piscina, etc.  Los dueños te dejan total privacidad pero al mismo tiempo están pendientes para cualquier cosa que te haga falta. Sin duda recomiendo a quien quiera visitar tulum este alojamiento. Quedamos encantados.",50,127
Place was super cool and nice! Staff was very nice and helpful when possible. Only One staff could speak English. The room and place were really nice and clean. A bit more expensive than it probably should be but it included breakfast and in a great location!,40,128
"Beware of their 3% credit card surcharge! This hotel is the ONLY negative experience I had during my entire 2-week trip throughout Mexico: the hot water was cold half of the time; no hair dryer in the room; the room reeked the odor of chemicals; it was extremely loud at night--they kept a dog who would howl an entire night right outside your window; the breakfast was way below Mexican standard, with only bread, fruits, and coffee, nothing was freshly made, no eggs, no nothing. The owner won't even lift her head from her laptop to greet you, and insisted charging 3% surcharge for credit card payment, which is something I never experienced throughout my several stays in budget hotels in Mexico.

"We needed a hotel at the height of the season, between Christmas and New Year, and ended up here because it was among the cheaper options. However, over US$100 a night for this place seems rather steep. The rooms are simple, which some might call cozy, it's very noisy in terms of traffic and music, and in our case there was no hot water. The breakfast was quite acceptable, if a bit overpriced too. I can't quite see the point of this place.",40,128
I loved the idea of this place and it came highly recommended by the Lonely Planet. Unfortunately a nearby club plays music very loudly until at least 5am (we stayed Monday and Tuesday). I can generally sleep through anything but not this time - I even wore ear plugs that had been supplied. This is the first time I have ever worn ear plugs. I still had a very uncomfortable night. We hoped it had been a one off but it happened the second night. We had booked three nights but left. If you want good sleep do not stay here.,40,128
"We stayed 2 nights in late November 2017 which is still low season so the room rate was good value for money in a popular destination along the Riviera Maya. Located on the main avenue close to everything. The room was adequate. Biggest complaints were low water pressure in the shower (not uncommon in the region) and the bed was a bit too small for 2 people. It overlooked a nice little tropical garden at the back and Tulum's main drag in the front from a shared balcony. Not the hotel's fault, but we spent one sleepless night due to the very loud music from a nearby club. Then again, Tulum is a party town and you may run but not easily hide. The Italian lady owner was friendly and served a nice ample breakfast that included yogurt and muesli (not common around here).",30,128
"We had a lovely private double room with our own bathroom & shared balcony. It was fairly quiet so not really a backpackers location, but in a good location & included a healthy breakfast but prices are fairly high.",50,128
"This hotel is in a great location, right on the main strip and close to a lot of the action. However, despite being recommended by Lonely Planet, it leaves a lot to be desired. The beds are hard and pillows flat. It was hard to get additional blankets or pillows from the housekeeping, and they kept taking it back when they cleaned. Speaking of clean, it wasn't. The floor felt like we were always at the beach, and they never cleaned the bathroom floor. They sometimes left enough towels for us, sometimes not. It was a gamble.  The biggest issue with this hotel is that there is blaring music until about 2AM every single night. There was also occasionally blaring music in the morning, including at 9AM on a Sunday. Not sure if the staff has much control over this, but for those who",50,128

"We got our room upgraded free of charge on arrival, staff have been so friendly and kind, addressing us by name.this is our first holiday post Covid and We will definitely stay here again on our return to Tulum",50,129
"We had the best time ever in this hotel. After dousens of hotels we draw the conclusion that this hotel has the most personal service. They went above and beyond for our wellbeing.  After many days with the kids in small hotel rooms we wanted an appartment. And this appartement was brand new, high ceiling, lots of space. New big smart Tv's and good internet. It had it all.  They rememberd our kids names, they took care of us when we became sick and much more. This is the first hotel where the employees have me a feeling that we as guest are also their Friends.  As you read we loved our stay, want to thank everybody in the team and give special thanks to Evelyn who went the extra miles for us. ",50,129
"This new hotel in Aldea Zama is difficult to find but worth it. The whole area is very well laid out and away from the madding crowd. It is a quiet and safe part of Tulum. Hotel was very good with roof top pool, verandah area with a private pool and a nice breakfast area. Vegetation makes you feel you are in a tropical garden. The staff were excellent - nothing too much trouble especially Esli and Sergio.",40,129
"Room wasn’t ready on time Safe - broken. Didn’t fix it Cleaners - lazy. Didn’t clean room properly  24hr WhatsApp - ignored Restaurant staff - poorly trained, and bad service  Room - damp  WiFi - didn’t work On site complaint - ignored Email complaint - ignored  The room prices were very high, and the service fell way short. Staff just didn’t respond to feedback seemingly not really caring.   Email follow up complaint completely ignored.   If I could give zero stars I would.   Would not recommend at all",10,129

El departamento tiene todo lo necesario para una estancia confortable y sentirte como en casa. Seguro regresamos!",50,129
"Nos encanto! un lugar rodeado de naturaleza, te hace sentir realmente en la selva. El depa muy amplio y bonito El staff muy atento, nos hicieron buenas recomendaciones de lugares para visitar comer etc. Teníamos nuestra alberca privada. La zona es muy tranquila y segura, está cerca del centro y las playas de Tulum.",50,129
"This was luxurious place for the value. Everything was new and looks great. True, there is a lot of construction in the area, but we did not have any problems walking to the restaurants or getting taxi. It is little secluded, but not remote at all. Staff is attentive, and very helpful, provided us with everything we asked for (fixed internet, brought coffee maker, made sure water was ok).   The only complaint I could have is that isolation is not the best and you can very clearly hear guests in adjacent rooms. But thankfully all the guests were respectful, so that didn't bother me either. This is newer hotel in the area, and there are some growing pains to overcome, but it is exceptional for the price and in great area. I will be back.",50,129
"He estado solo un fin de semana y me he quedado con ganas de más. Es un hotel muy nuevo en medio de la selva, pero con las comodidades de estar en Aldea Zama. El staff super atento y con mucho conocimiento del lugar porque me recomendaron un tour de cenotes, que nos encantó y dos restaurantes muy buenos. Sin duda volveremos",50,129

"Stayed for two nights here and it was a great choice. Alejandra, the owner, was super friendly and recommended lots of great places. She was helpful and made my stay very welcoming. The place is very central and easy access to the main road. The small coffee place serves yummy food and has great juices!!! Recommend it highly.",50,130
"Hotel Nicte-Ha is a wonderful place to stay; clean, fresh and close to everything you’d need or want for your visit! Alejandra is a wonderful host and you can tell she really cares about her guests  There is a wonderful cafe attached to the hotel as well, Cafe Turu, which is perfect for a healthy breakfast or lunch  Juan Carlos and Vicki are fantastic cooks and make real treats! Highly recommend!",50,130
I’ve stayed 7-8 places in Tulum and Nicte Ha is by far my favorite. You can’t beat the price and location. The rooms are exceptionally clean and extremely well decorated. The back patio is a great hang out spot and they also have a great coffee shop/smoothie bar right on premise. They rent bikes and scooters too but the best thing about the hotel is the owner Alejandra. Ask for he when you get there she is the best you will love her guaranteed!!,50,130
"The Budget Twin Room located by the entrance had a strong cigarette smell when checking in at 7pm , couldn't stand it so did not stay any longer.  Communication was very hard with the staff member. Seems like some basic customer service training is needed here.   There wasn't any other room options either. We did try switching on fan on full speed and open the window and door. But no change, asked for some kind of spray, staff never came. I ended up trying with my anti bacterial spray, nothing changed. I couldn't stand the smell, the room was so small but the smell would have taken ages to go away. Some mopping and cleaning surfaces with cleaning products and leave the room to air would have helped.   It was so intense it started to give us a headache in 20 min and we found it",10,130
" so weird because there was a very clear sign inside the room by the door, stating no smoking.    I said that it is impossible to be in that room, I was saying that I will check out/leave. The staff member explained that he was making calls but manager didn't pick up phone.   We had worked all day and arrived late and really just needed to rest. He was just standing there like he did not know what to do, when we explained in Spanish he just agreed that it smelled and that was it.   My last resource was booking another hotel and leave within the 20-30 min of arriving. Lost the night and the payment but could not have stayed. Disappointed because we just needed a cheap place to stay the night and ended up paying another hotel nearby than staying at Hotel / Hostel Nicte Ha Tulum.",20,130

"I walked around looking for a room since the hostel I arrived was awful and I wanted another place to stay. Peak season so everthing packed, and expensive. Nicte-ha had availability for 3 nights at 800 peso per night. The guy did not speak English but Google translate helped. Room not to big but OK and clean. Paid for the first night only because had to get to the ATM. When I arrived after having cancelled my other hostel booking I heard that the next day I had to move to another room. Checked that room but the bed was really really bad! Just spirals, no mattress. We agreed that I would decide the next morning if I would take the other room. After an hour looking for another place and finding out all was full I decided already that afternoon that I would like to stay anyway,",10,130
" only to be told that the room was not available anymore. What kind of service is that! So I was kinda forced to check out after 1 night, while I made a booking for 3. Actually after that 1 night I was glad to check out because it had been very noisy during the night with traffic, dogs, other guests arriving and loud TV at the reception. Really cardboard walls. Did not feel safe since the room could not be locked from inside and all the noise at night was just outside my door. Shower only had cold water. Big cockroche in the bathroom. Airconditioning and van were working properly. ",10,130

"I stayed at this chic, boutique hotel in Tulum for 2 nights in May 2022 and it was fabulous! My room was on the first floor at the rear. Huge room and bathroom with high ceiling. It overlooked the mangrove forest which was stunning!, with a large balcony where I sat down at times to enjoy the cool breeze.  The bathroom overlooked the forest as well!, that was exceptionally beautiful and calming for me each time I had a shower.  Loved the antique furniture, gave it a rustic vibe. The bed is large and comfortable.  The air conditioning only comes on from about 9 pm till the next morning, which is a common thing here in all the hotels. However, it’s was fairly cool throughout the day.  It’s across the road from the beach, which is approximately 150 metres away and is on the main",50,131

Diego, who has been working tirelessly at the front desk, always greeted me with a large smile and is very knowledgeable about the places to visit in the vicinity. He’s a star!  The manager of the hotel who also manages 2 other properties near was very helpful and even drove me and a few others, about once!  Overall I had a wonderful experience and stay at Tulum at this beautiful hotel and can’t wait to return someday!!",50,131

"I stayed in casa ambar because it was in a prime location in the hotel zone. They also had free bikes which I didn't know about to help me get around. It was nicer than waiting in a taxi. They had 2 sister hotels - I could access the beach from one, and a private cenote at the other. Why pay thousands for one of the popular hotels when you get the benefits of 3 hotels with your stay here? Definitely will come back again. The private cenote made everything worth it. Took some drone photos while I was there. I liked showering in the giant washroom with the jungle right outside my window. Highly reccomend",50,131
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! I have video proof of mice running around the kitchen were they cook your breakfast! The “manager” of this property tried to call me a liar and said I took the video at a different property, it’s blatantly obvious it’s their kitchen because the photos of the kitchen correspond with my video  Absolutely disgusting hotel and the staff are the worst I have ever dealt with especially the manager who is extremely ignorant and rude! €1700 for 5 nights and we only stayed for 1 night as we were repulsed at how filthy our room was, we had no hot water in fact the water wouldn’t even come out if the shower when we turned the hot water on! The bed sheets were covered in orange stains and they also felt damp, we had to sleep with our clothes over the pillows! Only",50,131

We could hear conversations being had in the reception from our room, you could hear people walking up and down the stairs at 6 in the morning! If you value your money AT ALL I highly advise to avoid staying at this hotel!",10,131

"What a beautiful hotel.  The staff was very helpful and friendly. Being in the jungle was such a lovely experience. The bed was great. We had fresh water in our room every day.  We made excellent use of the free bikes and the other properties. The breakfast each morning was awesome. It is in the nightlife area, so there is noise at night. The wifi is spotty. As long as you don't have work to do, it is fine. I highly recommend Casa Ambar",20,131
"We stayed in this location for three nights and loved the place! The hotel is perfectly situated. It sits rights across the street from a number of beach clubs, bars, and restaurants. There is great night life all around this part of Tulum, but we did not think the place was too loud (as some have said), since the hotel backs up into the jungle and has a big inner courtyard between the building and the street. Our room was  spacious and had an amazing balcony and massive open shower. The staff is what made it in the end though. Gamaliel is the man! You need someone to snag you a cab? He'll risk life and limb. You need quesadillas brought to the afterparty at 3:00am? Standby, they're coming up. The other staff was all very friendly and warm as well. Super easy to meet new friends",20,131

"Spent New Year’s Eve waiting in line for a fake Covid test: when I arrived at the festival 30 mins before midnight, we were told we had to wait in line to do a Covid test. Nothing mentioned about this on the website when I booked the tickets. The line was crazy busy, thousands of people crammed together with no masks waiting to get a Covid test. This was actually the first time in Mexico I was seriously worried I would getting Covid. Once it was midnight, I was still stuck in the line. When I finally got to take the tests, the organizers sent me in without even waiting for the results. They came about 30 mins later when I was already on thr dance floor. Obviously this Covid test is just fine to scam everyone out of $40 not to prevent Covid!!",10,132

So relaxing with the huge bed and beautiful balcony and view. Omg there is a restaurant right downstairs of the hotel and the food was amazing. Everything fresh to order. Service is as perfect, and if you go you must try the cheesecake. Overall 5 star. We met the Owners family and they made us feel right at home. One of the best places we stayed in Tulum Mexico. This place was recommended by our parents and it was the best recommendation. Each time I go to Mexico I’m staying here!  Thank you so much for the hospitality and experience.",50,134
"Sometimes things don't go perfect.  How management/owners handle situations like this go a long way for me.  Fernando (the manager) and Magdeep (the owner) handled such an opportunity like pros.  I was there to chill and relax...not so much to party (like a good amount of people visiting the area).  I usually stay on the beach, but wanted to see what a week in town would be like comparatively.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, very roomy and adequate in every way possible...especially considering the rate I received on Expedia.  My room was unfortunately the closest to the bar...which closed nightly at 12,  The first two nights were not really a problem as the bar quieted down at a very appropriate 11:00.  The 3rd night found the courtyard inside the hotel, adjacent to the bar,",50,135

After informing Fernando and later Magdeep of my bad night, they moved to a room further away from the courtyard and bar and guaranteed that everything would be quiet after 11:00 for the rest of my stay.  They delivered.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and appreciate that they understood that I desired an experience that might have been slightly different from their average clientele.",50,135

"The hotel is right on the beach, just a few rooms, very very calm. You can see palms, pelicans, sand and the sea just 5 steps from your room. I had even a house with a bedroom, a living room and small kitchen which was fully equipped. There was refrigerator and all necessary diches. There were sunbeds, hammocks and two small tables with chairs outside my house. The house was clearn, good towels, a hairdryer, beach towels were also provided. There was airconditioner in both rooms as well as fan. Housekeeping personal was very good and cares about everything. Drinking water and coffee was provided. Brekfast was delivered each day at 8:30 in to rooms. The was nice cenote 5 min. from the hotel, open from 9 to 17 where you can swim, snorkle, get a lifejacket, or have a diving lesson.",30,136
" Entrance fee is 150 pesos. There are a few other hotels arround where you can get lunch and dinner.  The hotel is quite far from everything if you have no car. It is about 10 km from Tulum downtown, and the same distance from zona hotelleria. Taxis can be found just few steps from the hotel but they are expensive (400-600 pesos for 10 min ride, more expensive after dark). There is a possibility to use a Collectivo microbus that runs from Tulum to Playa del Carmen but you need to catch it standing on the highway, and rising a hand. It costs only 25-50 pesos. The beach was bad in my opinion: lots of trash a few steps from the hotel, and there were lots of rocks in the water, and sea was not calm. Do forget about Mexican beaches from postcards. All area on the right side of the hotel looks abandoned.  For dinner the best option is to go downtown of Tulum where there are plenty of local and more fancy restaurants or to a Zona hotelleria for expensive western type restaurants and bars. Breakfast first two days was quite good but later it gets absolutely bad: fruits, juice, pastres and some granola. Pillows very hard, very uncomfortable, only one glass for a vine in a room. No TV, no safety box in a room. Internet weak and in some places not existant  but managable.   In summary : Quite Expensive 3 stars bed and breakfast in not the best location and very bad beach.",50,136

A notre arrivée, nous couvrant d'excuses auprès de Melisa la responsable sur place, nous avons intégré notre petit appartement...de plein pieds....à 10 mètres de la mer...! Et là, ce fût un enchantement pour ces cinq nuits passées en cet établissement....! Melisa vit donc sur place, sa mana assez âgée l’assiste, avec quelques autres personnes.

Précision, la plage comporte des rochers donc, se munir de chaussures antidérapantes c'est gain de sécurité. Le silence est total, le dépaysement également et, de votre salon extérieur vue sur la mer à....10 mètres...que demander de mieux...!

Melisa is the best host, she’s always caring for her guests to make them feel like home. The rooms are just seconds away from the beach (the best oceanview!), and if you’re lucky like us you can even get to see a turtle nest <3.  I almost forgot, the breakfast is fresh, homemade and tasty. This place is totally worth it, so if you’re staying in Tulum this is your best choice.",50,136

Great location and I used the beach access from another hotel that Valeria recommended, think it was called La Luna. I had the most delicious spicy mescalita from the restaurant!!!! Also the cabin was very close to my favourite breakfast place where I went every morning.   Cons: It is is very expensive for what it is but that is because it is on the beach. Compared to other hotels on the beach, it is the cheapest I could find. The cabin is VERY noisy at night as there",30,137
 is a nightclub next door and a loud beach club opposite. I had remixes of 2 songs at the same time until 3am every night. I can sleep through it but wouldn’t recommend if you are a light sleeper and plan to sleep before 3am.,50,137

"It’s a great location close to the beach but what I found so special about it, is the rooms itself. We stayed in the deluxe studio and had fantastic view into the jungle. At night you get a beautiful view into the stars above Tulum.  Another big plus is the super friendly and supportive staff. We got great restaurant recommendations and tour tips. Overall we felt in good hands!  Highly recommend to stay here.",50,137
"Right in the middle of tulum where all bars and restaurants are. Can’t fault for location! Rooms are beautiful, very clean and the staff where so so friendly! On hand with anything we needed and any recommendations! Would definitely stay again   Katie and Nathan",50,137
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the bungalow and it was exactly like the pictures and very clean. Perfect for 2 people and rooms seemed bigger in person. We were very impressed with the room, its jungle theme and the front desk was great. Carlos was AMAZING. He hooked us up with the best places to go and could answer all our questions. You do have privacy and they direct you to the room right when you arrive. They are very accommodating and provide filtered water, shampoo/conditioner and towels. You also can ask for beach towels and they will direct you to the hotel Luna that allows you beach access which was perfect!  It is directly across from Taboo Beach restaurant & club that has amazing food and drinks. The air conditioning worked VERY well. The bungalow is right next door to",50,137
" all the beach clubs and restaurants so you don't need to taxi anywhere. You can hear the music from inside the room like its a party in your room! We didn't mind this, however Carlos let us know if we needed he had a Bungalow towards the back of the property that we could use for the night. They also have an rooftop for food and drinks. Everything was great!! We made friends with the staff and they were very helpful. As the some other reviews stated, the beds are definitely firm and the room did smell a little bit but nothing made our stay bad. Overall, I 100% confidently say this was a fantastic stay! BOOK Mamasan!!! You wont be disappointed! We cannot wait to comeback!!",10,137

"I spent 2 glorious days in an upper geodesic dome room and will return again. The room was quite comfortable and simple.  It was remarkably quiet, also which was a concern due to the loud music across the street. Waking up and grabbing a cappuccino and smoothie was the perfect way to start my day. Their menu offers healthy and delicious organic food.  The price was fantastic but that is not what makes this place a gem.   The staff at Mamasan are some of the most helpful and kind people I have ever met in my travels. Pablo, Valeria and Carlos were amazing. As was the lovely blond woman. I hope we will all stay in touch mi amigos.  I had an issue with a scooter vendor and all of them offered to go with me to work out the issue. They talked to him for me and advocated for me",10,137
" without me ever asking. Truly beautiful human beings at a time when we need humanity.  Valeria, thank you for the great restaurant recommendation and your sincere kindness. Pablo, you will be a huge asset to any establishment that is fortunate enough to hire you.  Thank you for all your help.  Carlos, thank you for the hospitality, interesting conversation, and insight. If I still worked in the business I would hire all of you.  You are quite a team.",50,137

"Be cautious when booking a place here. My ""month contract"" was ended two weeks early. I was not given a refund for the two weeks that I had paid for at Elixir. Dalia will show you the place, and she is nice. However, the company is not good and is tricky (as the other review here noted). There are many great places to stay in Tulum. I would not recommend Elixir.",10,138

"We spent a week at the Little Gem after our original booking had to be cancelled.  The location was ideal for us as a couple traveling in our own vehicle.  The hotel is small, quiet, intimate, and lovely.  The room was large, comfortable, and has a small semi-private seating area outside by the pool.  The staff was great:  courteous, helpful, and friendly.  We will definitely stay here again in the future.",50,139
"We spent about a week at the Little Gem Charme Hotel since our originally planned beach hotel was not viable for us due to heat and the smell from the Sargasso algae. While the neighborhood may look sketchy to some with potholes and lots of construction going on, the room we had was modern, clean, quiet and nice with a fridge and very cold AC .  Neighborhood restaurants abound, a coffee/breakfast place is across the street. Staff was AWESOME in helping us getting reasonably priced cabs to Chichen Itza, the Tulum Ruins, Cenotes and back to Cancun. They were helpful in securing a nurse to administer the required COVID test. Coffee was available every day and water bottles were put in the rooms. Thank you Mayumi and Daniel and everyone else we came in contact with.",40,139
"Hotel itself is beautiful and the rooms are wonderful but too many issues occurred while we were staying there and we believe the staff were not honest. . First we rented all the rooms of the hotel for our group because we wanted to come back to the hotel and chill at the pool after everything closed early. The first night we got a noise complaint (from who, keep in mind because we have the entire hotel) and was told me can't have any music outside by the pool area for the remainder of the trip. We found this REALLY strange as the hotel staff told us where we could purchase a large Bluetooth speaker and even took the money and went to pick it up for us. So that was a burden on our entire trip starting on day 1. . Then the next day when went out of the hotel and 3 separate",10,139
 individuals all had money and watches stolen out of their rooms. There were located inside of their luggage. All of the rooms were locked so the only people who had access were the staff/cleaning people of the hotel. The rooms were cleaned so we knew someone from the hotel was in the room but they took no accountability and didn't want to report anything to the police. They were never called for the thief. . When checking out the hotel staff was trying to nickle and dime us claiming that we broke things that were already broken when we arrived and charge us for them. All minor things like the pool chair (which was poorly assembled and the pop in legs feels off when someone sat on them) or a small crack in the bottom of the large minor that was like that when checking in. . The entire experience was horrible and I would never consider staying here again,10,139
…,10,139
"This little hotel is a little Gem as for the look of it.  But lets talk about the theft.. this hotel allowed housekeeping to rob several of the rooms for watches and cash and did nothing.  They locked the doors from the outside and had an armed guard standing at the door which did not allow the guest to come and go as they pleased. This place may look amazing, but just know it is far from safe and their goal is to steal your valuables.",50,139
I stayed with a group of friends at LITTLE GEM AND LET'S START WITH SAYING 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE WATCHES and 2 people money WERE STOLEN. The staff would not get the owner to come talk to us or show the video,50,139
"I was torn on how to write this review.  I am giving it 5 stars because I think it delivered on its promise of what I was expecting - a very inexpensive place with a clean room and good service.  My wife and I stayed here just one night as we arrived at night from Cancun and didn't feel it worthwhile to pay for the expensive hotels along the beach in Tulum given our late arrival.    Here are the pros: 1.  Very inexpensive  2. New and hence modern and clean rooms 3. Very friendly and helpful staff - Graciana (?) was delightful, overall great service   4.  Plenty of good bicycles available for free  Here are the cons: 1. The location is why it's inexpensive.  You are a 100-200 peso taxi ride to downtown Tulum depending on the time of day and taxi you get. Getting to the Tulum",50,139
"Le cadre de cet hôtel est magnifique. Joliment décoré, il y a une piscine en bas et également sur le toit.  La personne qui s’occupe de l’hôtel est très gentil.  Le lit était confortable.  L’emplacement est top, situé à quelques minutes en voiture du centre de Tulum.  Cependant, je mettrais quand même quelques points négatifs… La chambre sentait l’humidité. Mal isolé. Pas de tapis de bain. Les wc fonctionnait une fois sur deux. Et l’absence du sèche cheveux. Nous avons payé 566€ pour 3 nuits, je pense que le tarif reste quand même surévalué.",40,140

This Airbnb was absolutely perfect! The hosts were tentative only when needed. It was super private and away from all the craziness that is the hotel district. The roads are unpaved but a small cost for such a wonderful experience and affordable place. We had a couples massage on our patio that was incredible as well. Highly recommend!,50,141

"We came to Tulum to have it as a base for exploring Yucatán while having a spectacular beach at our doorstep. Specifically, we wanted to visit the nearby Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. La Casa Mia was the perfect base for us. The ground floor apartment we had was huge. We had a big well-equipped kitchen to cook in for the days we didn't want to go out and sit on the beachfront and eat at one of the many eateries there. The beach was just across, less than 5 minutes to touch the sea. There was also a small rooftop pool to watch the sunset from! We loved it here. We even prolonged our stay and stayed a couple of nights in the smaller Suites Tulum next door. When we come back we are looking forward to staying here again!",50,143
"So, I'm going to start by saying that all of the positive reviews are warranted (in general.) This isn't a bad place to stay (per se.). In short the value proposition is fair, unless it rains. Now I understand that  no one can control the weather but a property owner can absolutely control leaks in the roof.  Rain coming through leaks in the roof made one of the bedrooms unusable. Leaks in the roof left standing water in the kitchen during the storm.   As it stands, I'd likely would not have mentioned only one A/C unit working or broken locks on doors or other small stuff because nothing is perfect. But a leaky roof?  They can do better.   On a positive note, The location was great Loco Tulum was very good and Martin was outstanding. He deserves a raise.   All in all, I guess I",30,143

Foi maravilhoso poder ver o sol nascendo no mar em meio à floresta maia. O quarto estava bem equipado, embora não conte com geladeira/frigobar. Acredito que este foi o único ponto negativo. A limpeza foi ótima, o clima maravilhoso. Os funcionários discretos. O hotel fica à beira mar, nosso acesso era pelo bar/restaurante. Infelizmente os garçons faziam pressão para consumo, ficavam constantemente oferecendo coisas para receber ""propina"", ou seja, gorjeta. Havia um pouco de sargaço, mas nada que atrapalhasse os banhos de mar. Foi maravilhoso ficar hospedado ali.",50,144

I only had a chance to stay one night at this hotel due to hurricane warning in the area.  Alicia was the hostess with the mostess.  She waited to greet me very late at night and gave me a tour of the property right away.  She made me feel very comfortable and even offered to take me to the market the next day if I needed anything.  The bed was comfortable and the room had beautiful pottery.  Plush bathrobes and nice shower.  The amenities and design of the property was nature meets local maya culture.  Alicia makes the stay even more special.  I would definitely go back to Chaca.,50,146
"I was so excited for my trip to Tulum and very impressed with the pictures of this beautiful hotel. Prior to my arrival, I received a WhatsApp call from the hotel stating that there was an error and there were actually no rooms available, so I wouldn't be able to stay there... I find it really misleading and disorganized that the hotel would have vacancies listed on Expedia, Kayak, etc. when their rooms are actually at full occupancy.  What a complete waste of my time. If this is how they conduct their operations, I think I may have dodged a bullet by staying at a place run in such a sloppy manner.",10,146

"My family and I stayed here March 2022 for spring break.  For starters, Tulum is quite a distance away for the airport. It’s roughly a 90 minute or longer drive.  Upon arrival, no one a at the front office. We contacted Karen via WhatsApp and she quickly responded.   The Room:  The room was average, a let out sofa that’s the size of a full bed and one bed upstairs. It has 1.5 baths, and a kitchenette area.  I think I was expecting more, but it was ok after we settled in.  FYI: the toilets have a tendency to stop up, so please be careful on how much toilet paper is used.   Though Pool: The rooftop pool was cute, just it very big. The water temperature was perfect.  However, I was concerned that the pool was not chlorinated. It didn’t seem like the water had been treated. I could",30,148
" be wrong. Nevertheless, it’s a decent rooftop area.  Also, there are 2 swings up there as well, that was a nice touch.   The Area: The hotel is located in a very busy area, but the plus is that it’s surrounded by a plethora of restaurants, shoppes, pharmacies, and bars.  We walked and ate at a different restaurant every night.  This hotel is not near any beaches, so take that into consideration.   The Staff: Karen was really nice and courteous. She was always very responsive when we needed towels, directions, assistance, etc. She was always pleasant and most helpful via WhatsApp.   David was nice, but he supposedly arranged a taxi for us that never showed up. I called and texted David on several occasions to inquire about the taxi and he never responded.  We ended up securing our own taxi. That was frustrating.    Side Note: we read other reviews and they stated they had money stolen, we did not have this issue. Nothing was ever taken from our room. We used the safe to lock up our valuables, passport, etc.  The safe however is extremely small.   We checked out early, booked a hotel in Cancun that was close to the beach and the airport.  Overall, we had a relatively good time.    If you happen to book this hotel, hopefully Karen is still there and will take care of you.",50,148

We had to go to Starbucks a few blocks away and luckily found a nice person who let us use  their phone to send a text.

The lockers are shocking, I could put my arm in to take out any belongings.   The dorm rooms walk out onto a Main Street and have old dingy doors with terrible locks that can be jigged open (you do not feel safe). Our room was broken into despite being locked at about 5.30 am one morning. Money stolen from one of their terrible lockers.  We even heard the man and he ran out the door before we could realize what what happening in our half asleep state.

The staff also hangs out and sleeps in rooms when they are not occupied, don't wear masks and I don't believe clean the places safely.

And Armando pretty much told us 'tough luck suckers,' in less direct words.  The owner refused to speak with us directly.  I would STRONGLY DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM STAYING HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The rooms are large, they don’t have A/C which could be an issue for some but they do provide a fan that makes for good sleeping. The only observation I would make is that it can be a bit (not extremely) noisy in the early morning. Overall the location and price point are incomparable in Tulum. ",50,150

It had a shared common area kitchen and a cool roof top area to hang out. The mattress was closer to futon quality than hotel mattress quality. No AC which is common for the eco-chic accommodations on the playa in Tulum. Also watch out for other nightlife on the weekend next door. It did not affect us but I heard that can be an issue. Tulum is a great fun place to visit, some people think late night DJ is fun.",50,150

It has a kitchen for all guests, so you can bring your own drinks or food (if you want to), we brought beers and it worked amazing as we spent the afternoon at the pool, the pool is not big but is a nice area to chill.  The room we got did not have air conditionning, however we had a fan, and it was a cool night so it was Ok, I loved the decoration in the room, and the tub from the bathroom was so nice as its made of wood. They explained they work with solar energy so you can not charge your cellphones after 10pm  due this.  The manager in charge was so nice, she left us stay at the pool after we checked",20,150
" out, and was so attentive to us that it seemed we were the only ones there.  There is a roof with a place to chill out as well, but we did not use it, however it was nice as well. I think if you are planning to visit Tulum and don’t mind not having neither ocean view or beach area at the hotel, this is the best option!!",50,150

"Hotel novinho em folha.  Provavelmente teve (ou teria) sua inauguração pouco antes da pandemia.  Viajamos em tempos de pandemia (out/20) e escolhemos um quarto compartilhado que acabou sendo inteiro para mim e meu irmão.  Ficou perfeito pra nós aquele quarto inteiro nos dois dias em que lá permanecemos.   Mas digo que, mesmo cheio, seria muito bem adequado e minha nota seria tão elevada quanto.  Como o espaço é novo, ele é bem condizente com as realidades de um viajante solo, seja na necessidade de ter uma tomada exclusiva próxima da cama, como também por ter um armário adequado e seguro.  Há como estacionar bem em frente ao hotel, o que dá uma sensação maior de segurança.  A rua é tranquila, mas não fica longe do centrinho de Tulum.  Recomendo esta escolha!",50,151
"Solo aceptaban pago en efectivo, no había jabón en el baño (y cuando lo solicite dijeron que no tenían en el hotel), al vencerse la habitación entraron repetidamente sin tocar (tampoco llamaron a la habitación pues no tienen teléfono en las habitaciones). La 3ra vez que entraron les indique que dejaría la habitación 1 hora después de la hora de salida, me indicaron que tendría un costo de $160 extras, con lo cual estuve de acuerdo, pero al momento de pagar el extra me indicaron que el costo ahora era de $320 (lo que me parece desproporcionado considerando que la noche costaba $526) y la actitud del recepcionista fue desafortunada, retadora, negando cosas obvias y diciéndome que era una falta de respeto el haber hecho un late check out, aun cuando acorde pagar el cargo extra que",20,151
"What a lovely find! This gem of a place is about 20 minutes away from Tulum, down a dirt road in the middle of the jungle, a 5 minute bike ride from the Dos Ojos cenote. It's remote, private, and really feels like you're in your own jungle retreat, while at the same time it's just a 2 minute walk to the lobby and on-site restaurant. We didn't encounter a lot of wildlife or insects during our trip, but they are certainly there, and because the whole resort is solar-powered don't expect to be able to plug in and charge electric devices overnight (but the jungle really comes alive at night with the sounds of nature, which is incredibly soothing to fall asleep to!).   I need to make a separate shoutout to Fernando, the head chef at the restaurant, who really put a lot of love,",50,152
" attention, and flavor into his dishes, and warranted a trip back to the restaurant a second time during the trip! Will certainly be coming back and staying during our next trip to Tulum!",10,152
"My boyfriend and I picked this hotel because it was affordable and close to both town and beach. We did not expect it to be as nice as it was considering the price. Ko’os hotel is in the middle of the Aldea Zama park, which gives the sense that you are really isolated from the city even though the center is only a 20 minute walk away. Also, just behind the hotel there is a square with a couple of really nice restaurants, that take you away from all the excitement of the city and really allows you to relax. The rooms are beautiful, and the setting of the hotel as well. The staff is super nice and always willing to help for organization and other questions. Plus, soaps and creams are provided in the room and smell really good!  You won’t regret staying here, if I go back to tulum",50,153

"I can deal with a certain degree of shabbiness at a certain lower price point. The blood stains on the sheet on one bed were a bit more troublesome. Exposed electrical wiring...come on. And cigarette burns on the bedside table.  One reason I chose this place was that it has a pool, except that at the moment the pool isn't useable.   The person manning the front desk was willing to be helpful, but didn't really seem to know much when I asked questions.  Absolutely the worst was the noise. One night guests came in at 3am, cranked up the music and had a party. On another, a nightclub was still blasting music at 4am. No way to complain to management about it...no phone in the room...and I doubt that they would have done anything anyway.  On the positive side, a decent WIFI",20,156

"I didn't stay here.  I checked out a room and it had that smell that can be in a lot of tropical places, maybe mold, bug spray, or something.  It was a lower corner room so all the rooms might not have the smell.  I have allergies and don't do well with mold and bug spray so I'm sensitive to those things.",20,156
"We stayed in this hotel for one night.  The room was not really clean and the furniture worn out. Bathroom broken with slippy floor.The guy at the reception was very unfriendly and it was a challenge to get even a roll of toilet paper. Not to talk about an additional towel. Sorry for being your guest, guys!   Next door there is a budget hotel as well with reasonable prices and good service.   Location is good.",30,156
"Clean, but good golly, who picked out the lousy mattresses this hotel uses? Never felt so many springs in a mattress before! Other than the mattress on the bed being the worst I've had the experience of sleeping on, it served it's purpose of having a roof and A/C. For 450 pesos, not a ""deal"" in the least. For 50 more pesos, other hotels will give you a better mattress to sleep on for a much better sleep. Spend the extra 50 pesos and go some place that will give you a mattress that does not let you know where all the springs are.",30,156
"Definitely a budget hotel,we booked this hotel last minute so we didn't really look around for other options.We just wanted a place to sleep. The price is moderate, the rooms are spacious with two double beds, the best feature about this hotel is the location close to restaurants, bars, shops etc. and also safe parking area. The rooms are outdated, nothing much , very simple. The room had a.c and fan. My biggest complaint is that the bedsheets look very worn and toooooo THIN! If you are looking for great, etc etc find elsewhere this hotel is BASIC. We stayed one night .",10,156
"I had a prepaid reservation with this hotel through Expedia.com and received a confirmation email and confirmation number. When we arrived, the hotel had no record of my reservation. I was told that the hotel had no available rooms and we could not stay there. I asked the man at the front desk if he would help us find another hotel and he said no. I asked if we could use his phone and he said it only receives calls but does not dial out. He would not let us use his cell phone to call another hotel.   I was eventually able to call Expedia via Skype and they tried to help me. They wanted to fax the confirmation number to the hotel but there was no fax number available, so they emailed the confirmation again but the guy at the desk said he doesn't get the emails, they go directly",10,157
" to Ernesto. Expedia called five times but Ernesto never answered the phone. The man at the front desk did not help at all and eventually the wifi connection deteriorated so much that we were unable to stay on the line with Expedia through Skype. Nobody at Expedia could speak Spanish (??) and the man at the front desk didn't speak any English, so I had to translate, but the man at the front desk just said he didn't know anything and couldn't help.   We ended up having to leave on foot at 10 PM, down a dark highway in between Tulum and Coba (me, my boyfriend, and my 14 year-old daughter). Fortunately, we found a kind stranger who called us a cab and we were able to find another room in Tulum.

When we showed at midnight the person at the front desk, Javier, said that they were fully occupied and that there were no rooms available. After much arguing he agreed to call the owner, Ernesto, who said that they had ""lost"" all reservations from Booking.com because they had a problem with the system. Turns out that this was nonsense since he was able to look up our reservation by our name and did not need the confirmation number! After much arguing, Ernesto, agreed to give us 2 rooms without electricity for the night. Their whole attitude was absolutely unprofessional!",50,157
"We took a group of students on a trip to Mexico, Palma Real was our first stop. Nice, clean little hotel where they bend over backwards to make sure your stay in good. They arranged for a local restaurant to deliver food each night and morning. Helped the kids with any requests they had and we had a ball. It was like we were part of the family before we left. I even forgot a Bluetooth speaker at the hotel, which normally means bye bye speaker in Mexico. The manager drove to the restaurant we were having lunch at to return it. Unbelievable, you don't find service like that in the US. This is a great hotel if you are looking for a good budget hotel. Great for backpackers.",40,157
Very basic (and clean) room with good wi-fi and good clean pool (its deep but there is a shallow section). Ernesto and the other staff were super nice. One thing that I noticed that I liked was that all of their linens were dried on clothes lines (love that smell!).  The new restaurant next door was very beautiful with amazing food! In fact I would drive from Tulum just to eat there. The village is about 21 kilometers from the hwy 307 intersection in Tulum so if you don't have a car you will need to take a collectivo or taxi. It is also about halfway between Tulum and the Coba ruins. This allows you an early jumpstart to the ruins before the cattle droves of tourists from the tour buses arrive. Tiendas (small stores) and little food stands within walking distance. They don't,50,157

This is a decent hotel similar to Motel 6 or Super 8 in the states.  The room is spacious and clean. The staff is also friendly. We ran out of hot water after 10 minutes of shower. The address shows Tulum but it’s really far from it. It is located in a small town about 30 minutes from Coba and 15 minutes Tulum.  We arrived at night and we couldn’t find any restaurants to eat so we drove to Tulum for dinner.  Wifi signal is strong in the room.  Good value hotel for Tulum.,40,157

I had my own car and with tulum 20 minutes away to the east and coba, chichen itza, Valladolid to the west its actually quite central. Trips to playa del carmen are Very doable aswell.

"Alleen maar positieve woorden! Cobanitas heeft een perfecte locatie, waarbij je met 2 minuten op het strand staat van Tulum Beach. Prachtige eco huisjes met heerlijke buitendouche. Het is overal mooi schoon doordat de lieve dames van de boot eco lodge elke dag schoonmaken. We werden heel fijn ontvangen voor Paula, waar we gedurende de dagen heel makkelijk en plezierig contact mee hadden. Cobanitas is echt nog het ‘originele Tulum’, een mooie plek voor een mooi prijsje.

This included bringing me toast and tea in bed, fresh bedding, checking i was ok and expressing they would get me anything I needed. The hostel is new, with lots of passion and love put into it. The roof top area is great for hanging out (covered area too) the drinks are cheap, the breakfast is sweet, the guys even make fresh jams! The pool is prefect, and clean. The dorms are clean and beds comfortable. Good working ac and mosquito shutters on the windows. The bathroom is also clean, with hot water and great pressure. Enjoyed my stayed and would definitely stay again!",50,159
"My small family of 3 and our friends' family of 6 stayed at Casa Xanath last week and we loved it. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. A/C units in the rooms were great. Our kids loved the pool which is open until 10pm. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown with amazing places to eat close by. It's around the corner from the ADO bus station which is super convenient. We rented a car during our stay in Tulum which allowed us to explore cenotes, the ruins, and the beach. Casa Xanath had free parking and a spot was always available.   One critique is the WiFi. It wasn't fast enough for me to work efficiently while in Tulum. Websites loaded like it was 1999. I used my phone as a hotspot so it wasn't too bad, but something to be aware of. If you're looking to",50,160
" disconnect then Casa Xanath is perfect.   If you're looking for the Four Seasons or Aloft, this isn't your scene. But our rooms were clean, had a little kitchen, and the price was very affordable.

We stayed three nights in casa xanath and were really very happy with the accommodation. It's located conveniently close to the main street of tulum town but on a quieter street.   Staff were so friendly and helpful.  There was a simple continental breakfast which set us up for the day.    Our room was spacious and cleaned daily. Air conditioning and fly screens meant we could open up for fresh air also.  We had a kitchenette which was really nice to prepare food and keep fruit and drinks in the fridge. There is a little shop across the road and a great fruit & veg shop on the next corner.   The hotel has a lovely clean pool in the centre to cool off in and a nice seating area with couches upstairs.   Parking was available also at no extra charge which was great   We would,50,160
Terrible! Avoid it. Sharing the same wall with a very noise disco - the buzzing noise last till 2:30 every morning. The entrance door is just opposite to crashed sex bar…No room cleaning. Big disappointment. Would not recommend anyone who wants to have at least some rest.,20,161
"Nuée's space was fantastic for all of Acrotravels acroyoga adventures! We literally played everywhere possible and the staff was super friendly (they even clapped for some of the poses we got into!)

They make cute animals shapes with the towels that make you smile when you enter your room after a long day.   For breakfast, Gricelda and Jen are in the kitchen- (order the mexican style eggs). You can tell by the smile on their faces they cook with love. The staff that serves is amazing too.   I asked for hot sauce and when they noticed I was pleased with the bottle hot sauce option they had, Gricelda said, “if you wait a few I’ll make you some hot sauce”. 5 mins later I was eating some delicious homemade hot sauce.

The concierge, Eli, was very helpful in getting scooter rentals and various things we needed for the room. The breakfast was simple but good. We never swam in the pool as we were out at the beach or on a tour but it was always clean even after the rains.

Located inside of the archeological zone which is a protected forest and minutes walk to the ruins. This isn’t hotel zone in Cancun, but it’s also not meant to be. Gorgeous property, amazing beach, fun beach club and restaurant, very reasonable price point for food and drinks compared to Tulum restaurants/bars/clubs/etc…, cold A/C, hot water and not a single mega resort in sight. We’ll definitely visit again and have absolutely no problem recommending this property to friends/family!",50,163
"Small cottages with basic bathroom. No chairs outside the cottage (not as seen on hotel pictures!). It looks much nicer in the brochure than in real. No airconditioning, just a portable fan, which is of no use (just making the already warm air blowing around).   The beach club is ok; the drinks are nothing special. Our apérol spritz was prepared with an already flat prosecco without bubbles. For 200 MXP an absolute rip off!!!  The food at the restaurant close to the reception is not recommendable at all! The pasta is overcooked, the service absolutely awful. Do not go there! It is an absolute waste of money! There are mich nicer restaurants around! Never ever again!",20,163
"This is a beachfront hotel that used to be Zazhil Kin and is under new management and construction. The current price, around $100/night reflects the minor inconveniences and construction noise.

Santos really stood out and was knowledgeable about the menu, professional and very open and friendly. I had a lot of fun talking with Santos. His English is very good, he is highly motivated and I have no doubt that he will be successful.   The beach club here is great if a little loud at times. It was very convenient to stroll down and spend the entire day at the beach.  They serve good food at",40,163

"While the location of this hotel on a beautiful beach is great, and it has high potential, there was just so much wrong with it under the surface that it felt more like a 2* stay rather than a proper resort - and was not worth the price. There was no hot water in the showers during my 6 nights there (two different rooms), no water pressure either (trying to wash your hair in a dribble is not fun). Only wifi in the lobby which barely works, and no phone/data signal in the rooms either. Towels and bedding had stains on them. They rarely had beach towels available and reception staff (not all) were unenthusiastic about finding solutions. When the bikes were unavailable to rent, no alternative was proposed. In general the service was extremely lacklustre (didn't seem like the staff",40,163

A male staff member was extremely rude to my friend when she was asking about a hairdryer (surprise surprise - not available). Two female staff at reception were the exception to this and were helpful, but were definitely outliers. The hotel is still under construction, so they were building a pool right outside my room. When I moved to a different room, I realised they were constructing a new floor above our room. All of this was extremely noisy. No semblance of any senior management around the property to speak to. In general not what I would expect for a resort like this and for this price. It has high potential but at the moment it is not at all worth it.",50,163

There aren't any draws for your clothes or irons, microwaves or coffee makers in the room. The mini bar consists of Chips, nature bars, Oreos, water, coconut water and Herseys cookies and cream. Upon arrival it wasn't the warmest reception. I felt like I was walking into a room of gossiping women. It was odd but they weren't rude.   They give you a number to text on whats app should you need something. Yoga though advertised on the website as twice a day (morning and evening) was only in the am.

" issues of every day. My check out day was just ridiculous. Long story short. I got pen marks on a sheet and a pillow case. With no push back I agreed to pay for it. My cab had to wait 25 minutes resulting in me having to pay extra because Estrella tried to rob me. Her manager told her it would cost $18.00 usd  $15 for the sheet $3 dollars for the pillow case. Fine I agreed. Between my mini bar and the sheets Estrella tried to charge me over $800 pesos which I caught. WhEN I asked her she said it was several sheets. I told her to please get the other sheets and no problem I just wanted to leave. Back story asked that they get the sheets I messed up. If I am going to pay for it I will be leaving with it. Well I asked her to please go get the other damaged items. She was refusing after a few minutes. She stormed off telling the security to close the door and stand by it. As if to say I am going to run off. Mind you the driver is still outside with my bags in his car. Anyway 2 minutes later she came back and said for get it. Bengo I wasn’t protesting anything she was just trying to over charge me. She got busted.   She wasn’t done. Kept messing with the calculator and CHANGING figures. She still was getting over 700 pesos so I said let me do it. I had her read off each we did it together and low and behold it came unto 610 pesos. She was angered at this point I wasn’t tripping just annoyed I just wanted to leave before I missed my bus. Well from that point on she had such a nasty attitude and was being nasty. I signed my name and she erased it screaming at me to sign how my passport is. The whole time im confused. I asked her why are you mad? She tried to steal from me and she is mad. Whatever. I continue and there was a paper on the table I picked it up thinking it was my copy and she snatched it from me. Thats when I had to give her some choices words. It was so embarrassing and ridiculous. All of this just over $30 US dollars.  She told my driver some nasty things about me and smirked.   I should have known from their behavior below they are struggling and very nasty people.  What I did not like was Dianna I had to many bad experience with her. She is just rude. and passive aggressive.   1st I walked 2 reception because they just read your messages on whats app and don't respond. I asked her can I get another wash cloth because they only gave me one. She coldly told me ""it's only you. you. get only one"". I explained I needed one for my body and another for my face she said ""no"" annoyed I pleaded with her for what felt like 20 minutes. Trying to explain the importance of the separation she told me "" You can go to the store and buy a sponge"" ( I cant make this up).  She finally gave in and said ""if something happens to it you have to pay for it"". Disgusting  Fast forward to the next day I messaged on the app asking If I can extend by a day or 2. Dianna (who I didnt know who it was at the time until I went to reception to ask) said theres no more space for the Sunday but they have space for you on Monday. so she said I can book you at our sister hotel if anything. I said ohh ok thank you. This should have ended the conversation. She decides to write me "" check out is a 11am (pictures). I felt it was rude and told her that. Relax   Another issue was I went to reception to request my room to be cleaned and I was turning in my pool towel for another one. I had Oreos the night before and no where to wipe my hands so I wiped it on the towel lol. I handed it to this women (donna) and she held it up looking and it flipping it back and fourth looking at it like she was bothered the manager (a man was there) Donna said what is this "" I said it's Oreos it clearly food"" she continued to make a spectacle of the situation like she was trying to embarrass me but I master in ""ignoring nasty behavior"" the manager I can see his face he smiled with a look of shame and was like ""I love Oreos too"" he said we laughed and I walked off.   the icing on the cake. I just need a few more days in Tulum to gather my thoughts and discover more food. well. I messaged her again on whats app a few hours later asking if the sister hotel had rooms she said hold on let me check. mind you I was just trying to see if it was cheaper. 45 minutes to an hour she messaged me back saying no its booked. Now im like she just has a problem. I was on the website to book I had their page up plus a third party site. I refreshed my page and still it was available. unbeknownst to her  I booked and said thank you.  I do not like nasty staff and I can tell they are on a strict budget if you like changing towels everyday dianna will make you feel uncomfortable like your a problem. bathroom amenities aren't replenished you have to ask. Everyone else was ok. She really made this a weird vibe. I hate it here.   Location is sketchy while only a 5-10 minute walk it's in the middle of the slums. A lot of poverty and nobody outside. I did not feel safe and spend the 50 peso to get someone to drive me to and from the ave. For solo traveler skip it. theres nicer places  They have bike rentals but they are 100 pesos a day with 500 dollar deposit and the bikes are old.  Laundry Service they charge per piece. Which is expensive. It smelled amazing though. Do not look for stain removal thats not happening a standard wash. it smelled so good. if you do not like heavy perfume smell skip it. I loved it hehe  Breakfast Only no restaurant. I never tried it as it was to expensive for tulum. I know that we are tourist but stay humble. Skip it.  Over all I really loved the am yoga the guy was amazing.pro tip take a beach towel with you to lay over the mat they don't wash them down. Plus they are falling apart. The mat was crumbling all over me. Gross   I loved the rooms spacious and secluded. I loved the smell of something burning  coming from the neighbors everyday. It was cool   would I stay again? No, I only liked the villa. when I was hungry I had to make a whole thing because I wasn't going to walk in the hot a*s sun in that neighborhood. They have a app for food delivery but the prices are ridiculous. More expensive then the us and I am from NY. Plus the stray dogs are soooooo many. I found myself hiding behind cars. I can't risk getting chased. I am to cute for that lol   NO HOT WATER LUKE WARM TO COOL   funny I went on their website and they said luxury lol people get to say anything. Nothing special here just a villa and plants. This is coming from a person who only stays at 4-5 star hotels. Momma is not impressed. I need them to get some guided meditations something. Theres no wellness going on. Just morning yoga.  it is not a resort.   Pro tip change your money you loose value keep paying with US dollar money. The taxes take 18 pesos per US dollar the rate at exchange it 18.75. Stay woke  Donna has got to go. she really is a bad vibe.    it's just bad vibes, Skimpy Service, Sketchy neighborhood , dishonest.  Sketchy neighborhood BEWARE FEMALE TRAVELERS",50,165

We stayed for one night and took the bikes into town ...the rooms are very large and beautifully decorated with a large bathroom and shower...great value! Staff was very helpful and accommodating.

"What сould be hidden under the mask of these beautiful photographs of this paradise place ?!  Indifference and complete insensitivity to the hotel guests !!!  I would like to share with you the following information:  On the second day of our stay in the hotel, around 12:00 a.m., my phone was stolen at the hotel entrance !!!  On the fifth day of our stay in hotel, in the daytime, we discovered a hotel worker leaving our CLOSED room (he explained this intervention by checking for hot water). After this meeting we immediately checked our bags, money and recognized that around 200 USD was stolen! For our claims regarding this situation Hotel administration answered that it is not possible that their worker stayed into the room. I am suggesting that they are in cahoots.   Terrible",30,165

"We booked this hotel for one night via Expedia, but when we arrived they said they were overbooked and had no room for us. They also claim to have contacted Expedia to say the booking was cancelled but that is not true.  In the Expedia reviews I can see this has happened before to someone else. I think this hotel gives discount rates on internet sites but if another customer shows up and pays the full rate then they just cancel some internet bookings.  So if you do book this hotel don't be surprised if you arrive and they turn you away.",10,167

"A completely horrible experience. Firstly, the location is in a bad area of town, and literally next to a big pile of trash. Unfortunately, you cannot see it in a Google Street View, otherwise we would have never booked it. Secondly, the property is not marked in any way. Luckily, the neighbor has pointed us to the right direction, otherwise it is very hard to find the place. Then the worst part: when we got to the place, we were offered a room with one single bed. We are traveling as a family, so the room we have booked was supposed to have a full bed and two sofa beds. When we have asked where the sofa beds are, the host has pointed us to the benches in the kitchen area. Which are literally two concrete benches 5x2 feet each, with a thin seating pad on top. Not sure how they",10,169

It was my son's birthday and the bar gave him 3 birthday shots of tequila, mezcal and gin. The view sitting in the restaurant was fantastic!  The hotel is right across from a cenote and it was beautiful for swimming. It is also on the south end of town, so it is away from the thump-thump craziness of the party zone.   Overall, I would say the hotel ranges from very good when the weather and seaweed are bad, to probably excellent with good weather and no seaweed. So check conditions for your trip.",50,170

We had called a few hours earlier to inquire about a reservation, and we told they don't accept them.   The oceanfront dining looked nice, but we were never able to try it.",20,171
Ate dinner here after staying in the area several days. Nice ocean front eating but horrible music and AFTER finishing the meal they informed us their credit card machine was down.

"Very bad experience when we arrived a week ago. After asking, the US manager of this hotel told me first he had no reservations for the night, then phoned the reservation manager who told she had none. I reserved 4 month earlier and showed the mails. Despite that, I was shown two rooms in an anti-climax and suspicious way. What a posture. I have been all over the world and never had such an horrible experience. You have one chance to make a good impression. It was a total fail from the persons running this business.

The bed was extremely comfortable, it had a very nice bathroom, and cool balcony. The rooftop pools were cute and nice place to relax and meet the other guests in the hotel.   The hotel was in a pedestrian area of cute shops and restaurants making it easy to find nice quick meals for breakfast, lunch, and a dinner. There is also a bike rental place within a few feet, fresh market, pharmacy, and even a COVID testing site a couple blocks down the street.   Gustavo was really nice offering us to check in early and holding our bags even though the room wasn’t quite ready so we could go explore and take a tour so we didn’t loose any",50,172

The fridge/ freezer unit was not working properly but within 15 minutes of my complaint a large bag of ice was delivered which bolstered the freezer.

The floor is full of broken glass and the staff doesnt even bother to clean it. Also they have a pool which you shouldnt even come close to, because ""it might get contaminated"".

This is very unusual for a private room and I had to ask for it from the front desk anytime that I wanted to make a change to the temperature.  There was not hot water on feb 22 or feb 23.

"We stopped for massages at the open air spa at the beach of this lovely hotel, and experienced the most wonderful treatments. The two therapists were so skilled and friendly, and had techniques that were really effective for relieving stress. We’ve had massage treatments in many different countries and places, and we agreed that our treatments here were absolutely stellar - bravo!",50,175
Our trip to Tulum started out on a questionable foot when we transferred from Akumal. The cab driver wasn’t quite sure where BT Live was. I had done some research on both where the resort was and also about the Boca Paila area where the resort was located. My inquiry garnered that it was next to Tita Tulum resort. Couple that with the party reputation the area had and that the resort promoted itself as eco-lodging. Our choice of BT Live met with some trepidation given that we are more familiar with four star accommodations. The cabby seemed to know where the resort was so while we sat in traffic on the narrow congested road I clarified the location to show him the address. He assured us we were in the right place. Little did we or the cabby know that Tita Tulum didn’t exist,50,175
" until we came to a nearly screeching halt when we saw the patchwork LOVE sculpture with BT Live at it’s base.  We disembarked with our luggage out onto the jammed road only to have to cross it to get to the entrance. Thankfully the guard at the gate stopped traffic long enough making crossing uneventful.  With baggage in tow we entered the somewhat crude entrance to the property. We both looked at each other wondering what the hell we got ourselves into. Our guessing didn’t subside when we saw the reception area was just a thatch roofed shack. If it weren’t for Michelle and JJ greeting us so warmly we might have turned and walked away. Michelle then guided us to our room along a sugar sand path. Mind you there’s not a formed piece of concert aside from the buildings themselves in this place. So you could guess we still weren’t convinced. Once we got our room it was Spartan nothing fancy yet clean and roomy. A few minutes behind us JJ delivered our bags.  The furniture and its accompanying decor was impressive. Yet, if any of you ever stayed a B&B’s you know sometimes the curtains don’t match the bedspread. So it is here. Furniture mismatched, the simple construction of the building itself leaves holes where there shouldn’t be and fixtures don’t quite work the way you’d want them to. Taking a shower took some patience for the hot water to come around. The toilet didn’t have the force it would have had in the states (don’t flush the paper). The lights worked but not always when you expected them to. In fact electricity was lost a couple of times. Finally we asked what was going on. We got the answer we hoped for and was confirmed when we saw workmen out on the busy road making repairs. This was the case when ever we had a mechanical malfunction of one sort or another. A quick response and the issue taken care off.  This set the mood for our stay. Everyone one of the staff from the guys in the restaurant, to the bar, to down on the beach and to the rooms.  Our needs and wants were met with graciousness and smiles. Sometimes it took a little effort to get what was excepted ie, bottled water in the bathroom to drink for medications, clean set of towels, a little extra of this or that. All attributed to the Mexican minute.   We arrived our first day late and didn’t quite get the system down for where to eat so we choose to eat at the resorts restaurant. Our meal was simple, it was recommended we try the Chiconitas (sp). Which where tasty joined with a cerveza. Later we learned it was one their specialties. A shredded pork based fare slow cooked under a fire pit during the evening hours. We had the opportunity to sample them again the next morning during breakfast when we watched the chef uncover and open the pan. My guess is they do this about once a week probably on Saturdays.   Speaking of which breakfast was included consisting of a plate of fruit, small sample of yogurt, toast, juice, coffee or tea and an egg dish with potatoes and a bit of beans. You could also choose something off the menu. We found that the breakfast albeit consistent from one day to the next was still satisfying enough to start the day. A few times we asked for scrambled eggs with a little cheese or eggs over hard and scrapped the beans. All this met with accommodation. However, we did get charged extra once for the cheese when we hadn’t during the week. Which we found some what odd since it wasn’t a great amount or effort to do so. None the less each morning we set off with a full stomach.  Though our first dinner met expectations and the breakfasts met our needs we found that eating dinner at one of many restaurants in the village to be more satisfying if not adventurous.  With the advice and guidance from the staff we enjoyed several meals near and around the resort to be a foodies dream. JJ actually walked with us to one establishment that we like soo much we ate there twice. In general our foodie experience was not the least bit disappointing. Though we did get up and walk out of one restaurant. Not because it was bad but for its lack of what we hoped was going to be on the menu. The items weren’t available.   Our room was simple and the view from the balcony spectacular. We dare say we lucked out having the room we did so close to the beach. We thought it was a mistake. There could be some improvement. As I mentioned we did have to ask for some drinking water and towels once. And a few times the dirty towels where left behind. We appreciated the firm bed but after a week it got a little too firm. We could have used more pillows that weren’t quite so soft. We used the decor pillows to boost our heads up which is ok but not usually the standard we used too.  Being familiar with construction I found gaps around windows and holes in roofs and walls to be an over site that really shouldn’t happen. My wife said it’s part of the ambience of the place. It is until you wonder how the bug got into the room.  We don’t usually listen to trance, dance or down beat type of music so when we first heard it we accepted it would be the norm and kind of enjoyed it. When we heard so much of it every where and sometimes the same playlist day after day (especially from the adjoining restaurant and beach bar).  We joked that we were certainly out of our element. Which is one reason why we visited the one restaurant twice because they played a different mix than the usual stuff catering to the general crowd.     When you first immerse yourself in the Boca Paila district you wonder if it’s just another drug induced Cancún or Playa Del Carmen. (Though we suspect there were agents of the cartel type perusing the beach none approached us) Yet it doesn’t seem like it. Same is true of BT Live it either wants to be just like it’s neighbors or just a little bit less offering a rest from the chaos Because of our age we did feel as though we where out of our league. Having said that we never felt entirely out of place and reassured when we saw folks closer to our age. There is no doubt where BT Live places it’s idea customer, like that of the rest of the establishments do in the area. With its tourist attracting photo taking moniker outside its walls and hip music being played throughout the day.  A younger, more affluent, stylish, even mature clientele seems to gather here. Despite our uncertain choice for accommodations and the area for which it stood.  We enjoyed our stay. It took some getting used to the simpleness of the complex and the energy of the area but that was the beauty of it. The lack of groomed sidewalks or tailored rooms or refined dining is an example of what it is that’s important. The easiness of the property, it’s bohemian vibe and the great service make this property worth another visit. It is our habit to visit a area or establishment more than once. It is our hope that our next visit will be as enjoyable if not more so.",40,175

"I enjoyed my stay at the former Hotel Xcanan (now under recent ownership by BT Live Tulum). The room was fine and had most of what I needed. The free breakfast at the BT Live restaurant was very awesome. I went at sunrise and sat out on the deck with my coffee and breakfast. The front desk receptionist, Michelle, is amazing and super kind. My only down mark is the super loud, booming music late into the night. Fortunately, they tone it down by midnight, but then my fellow guests brought the party back home. So sleep is not something that is a plus for this place. But the location totally overshadows the lack of sleep. I got a massage outside and spent the day in the sun. People watching is the best. I'll surely be back.",50,175

"We chose this location because it’s at the end of the beach road near the Sian Kaan in tulum and has access to a cenote. It’s a very secluded and quite little hotel in the jungle.  Pros: big bed with mosquito net, big room, beautiful antiques, amazing service and staff, quiet nature location. Fresh fruit and coffee in the morning brought to your door. We needed an extra fan for our baby because it was so hot, Jorge at the front desk had one the next morning, our shower wasn’t working well, we had a new shower head the next day. Service is really really good!   Cons: path to the cenote needs A LOT of work, too sketchy to carry my baby across so only ended up going once. No amenities, the breakfast was super simple which is fine but if you want any variety you gotta go elsewhere.",50,176
" Hotel is at the very end of the beach road and the road is in bad shape + traffic it can take a white to get back and forth. The beach access for the hotel is like 20 mins away down the beach, it wasn’t walk across access as I thought.    Overall, great stay! I would definitely go back. It’s the Mexican jungle don’t expect luxury. Bring some natural mosquito repellent, burn the copal, enjoy the peace and tranquility!   Much love!",10,176

"Overpriced hotel as usual for Tulum. You will get a nice looking “design boutique hotel” - at least for now - for quite some money. You almost need a 4x4 to get through the unpacked road to get to the hotel. The bar functions as reception to assign you to one of the rooms around. No elevator. Heavy bags need to go up - maybe the staff will assist. Prices are elevated at the bar, same, as usual in tulum. Rooms look nice but if you look a bit closer everything is done quite cheap, not really professional and without any real sustainability. Furthermore the hotel just tries to be trendy. Why put a French press in the “kitchen” if there is not even a water boiler and coffee?

We showed them our proof of booking/payment and the receptionist told us that it wouldn’t be honored.  That’s when the real scam started. The staff then told us that we could make a “new” reservation. They then proceeded to show us the EXACtT SAME room that we booked and then proceeded with the hard sale tactic of telling us it was the only room left. Funnily enough, it was only available for our original dates for more money than our original booking. After all this, because of the hour, we",10,178

I communicated with the staff before arriving and all of my questions were answered by the amazing staff.  Edgar, Gilbert  and the staff were amazing.  The breakfast was great and you could order omelets if you wanted for a nominal fee. The lighting in the bathroom is soft  but there are mirrors placed strategically outside the bungalows which is really cool.  I had fun doing my makeup outside.

"We stayed here twice, Oct 2021 and Mar 2022, under old and new ownership. With change of the ownership in Jan 2022, everything changed in that hotel. So watch out when your booking says it includes ‘breakfast’, it’s only ‘continental’, which they forget to mention and only tell you the first morning of your vacation. It’s literally toast and fruit. Everything else like any type eggs, cappuccino  or just hot water for a tea costs extra and is quite expensive, e. g. an omelet is $20 CAD! . Used to be all you can eat buffet. If you like black tea, make sure to bring your own tea bags, never any there!

"My boyfriend and I traveled to Tulum on our trip to Mexico. We didn't plan to stay in the room long, as we are an adventurous couple and essentially just needed a place to rest and sleep. We chose Andrea's Tulum due to its location, being on the edge of town, and its cheap rate, $30 U.S. dollars per night, however, we paid in pesos. I highly recommend paying everything in pesos in Mexico. Not only is it a hassle for locals to exchange but you get a better rate by paying in pesos.   The room was quaint and clean. The beds were soft and the room was cool. The rooms are very dark and have an underground feeling which made the room temperature cooler, a relief from the hot and humid days in Mexico. The A.C. was strong. There was a cute nightlight lantern on the bedside table. The",40,188
" room came with free wi-fi which was spotty but we expected that. It also came with free bike rentals with a deposit that you got back once you returned the bikes which were nice because other places charged for bike rentals. The girl we paid for our room each night was very nice as were the rest of the staff. The hotel is home to a stray mother cat who recently had a litter of kittens. She and her kittens were extremely friendly and welcoming to tourists, letting people pet them and meowing in affection.  The restaurant was bit pricey but being tired and not wanting to drive into town to eat all the time, we ate at the restaurant. An average meal of two entrees and two beers cost around $20.00 U.S. dollars. The food was good and service was quick. We even got free chupa chups at the end of a meal! The restaurant also had a drink bar where you could buy fresh, ice cold coconuts for $2.50, 50 pesos, way cheaper than buying coconuts on the beach which were about $6-7 U.S. dollars. The restaurant is also known for their delicious coconut ice cream which is slightly expensive but totally worth it.   The location was great as it was away from all touristy hubbub of downtown Tulum. It is right next to the Tulum Ruins but has enough distance between the extremely touristy road leading to the ruins that are cramped with vendors trying to sell souvenirs to tourists. My boyfriend and I biked to the ruins from the hotel and it took about 10 minutes. Bike riding is a big thing in Tulum and an easy and cost-efficient way to get around.  One thing that did dampen our stay was the water not working. At night the sink and shower wouldn't turn on. If the water did work, it was cold. A few times we did manage to get hot water, but again we did not mind because we were just looking for a place to sleep while exploring Tulum.  On one our last night, we saw a cockroach in the bathroom which freaked us out. Neither of us had ever seen a cockroach before and after that incident, we were wary of entering the bathroom.   Overall, I would stay at Andrea's Tulum again despite some mishaps. It was worth the price and since we had a rental car, we could still be on the quiet outskirts of town to retire for the night but be close enough to drive in and around the surrounding areas of Tulum to explore.",20,188

Shower was lovely with hot water and ample pressure. But three times during our three nights here, we had no water so we had to ask the staff to fix it. Also the WiFi in the rooms is really poor.

When we arrived they told us that if there is a card payment we have to pay extra (I am not sure if this information was included in the booking). Also their prices online are given without VAT, so be ready to pay more than you wanted.   Except the archaeological site there is nothing in there. If you wanna eat something you can only eat in the hotel, as everything else gets closed at 5pm. Their staff is not very nice and welcoming, it feels more that we are a problem for them. As the rooms are just next to the bar and gift",10,188
" shop from the early morning you can hear a lot of noise of people.  There was a TV in the room which was working as if you don't have a bike you can't do anything around there in the evening. Also as the place is in the forest side, there are lots of bugs around (not only mosquitos). Rooms have a wifi- which is quiet ok.   If you have to go there try to leave as quick as you came :)",10,188

"We went to Tulum super excited about our staying at the Andrea's hotel.. But what a disappointment! It sound so good with the including bicycles and the price was more then affordable, although it was a bit far away from Tulum..  We arrived to Andrea's around 12:30, and it seamed like the staff were really disturbed by our presence. We weren't able to either leave or bags there or borrow the bikes because of the check-in that was 2 pm.. The personal at Andrea's were really unpleasant and rude and we felt really stupid - it should be the opposite. If you want your customers to feel at home and be pleased, you have to treat them in a good way.  Doesn't recommend this hotel to anyone.",40,188
SOOO NOSY!!! We couldn’t sleep any of the nights we stayed. Air condicioned made such a bad noise and neighbours we so rude playing electronic music until 5 am. Also many people partying in any place and coming people out from de hostel. TERRIBLE IF YOU WANT TO GET REST AT ANY TIME. There’s music and voices al ALL time.,10,189
"I love all the staff at Hostel Tzunun, Always friendly and helpful. I stayed in a cabin and the bed was comfortable and the hostel had everything I needed, kitchen, bathroom, nice new swimming pool and a beautiful rooftop area where I could practice yoga and also enjoy relaxing with a drink and friends. Hostel Tzunun was reconizable because of the amazing art on the front and I was lucky enough to meet the artist and see him working in progress one day. The hostel is located toward the end of town that turns off to go to the beach which is great because you can walk to Super Aki to get groceries, banks, returants and food. The owner helped me hire a bike and I rode to the beach in 15 mins. I honestly love it here and am planning to come back as soon as I can. The vibe is super",50,189

"Olas has been my favorite hotel in Tulum for over 10 years. I have stayed there at least 5 times and have sent countless friends. Like many have said in their reviews, it was a gem in an ever changing Tulum.   April 8, I brought 15 of my fiends to Olas, for a new mom retreat. All were either pregnant or new moms and we were seeking a restorative weekend.   Over a month and half after booking out the property, the manager informing me that there was a new venue next door that occasionally played music. The cadence of the music was not always know and “some guests had no complaints about it while others did”…from their website it appeared there would be a ticketed event during one of the nights of our stay   I asked the manager what I should do with the information and she let me",10,190
" know that she just wanted me to be aware. I appreciated her care and asked her to keep me posted on any developments with the venue prior to our weekend. (to which I got no updates until 1 day prior to arrival).   Based on the tone of the conversations, I was not alarmed and expected some music …   Upon arriving, we discovered that to describe what was happening as “music” was not accurate.   The hotel was now home to a full fledged club that RAGED daily from 12pm to 2am with techno, Deep house and electric metal like music.   To say the music was loud was the understatement of the century. The noise was soul penetrating. The vibrations made the pictures on the walls shake and earplugs along with noise cancelling headphones could not even DIM the insane decibels. Our ears literally hurt and chests beat from the vibrations. The inside of the room felt like standing in front of a speaker.   In a million years, you would never expect that a hotel could or would operate next to such noise levels.   Friday night, we managed as we expected some music. However on Saturday, the the volume and bass was sooo much louder, that several of my travel companions had panic attacks.   Management was not on property for the ENTIRE weekend, and after we alerted them - re the gravity of the gravity of the situation, the would not accept our calls.   Another woman who wasn’t part of our group was also horrified and left the hotel after not hearing back from the management.   As we were 15 moms, there weren’t enough rooms to relocate us anywhere else and we were stuck for this torture for another night.   While we really empathized with Olas as the music is not their fault, we felt that a refund for Saturday night was more that appropriate given that no one slept and we couldn’t participate in the next days programing as people weren’t feeling well.  The management became defensive and aggressive noting that they had done their job and “managed our expectations”.  Rather than offering compassion and acknowledging a horrible situation- all the owner kept harping about was that they had “managed our expectations”…   16 people chose to stay at the priority (including people outside our group) after the hotel “managed expectations” … clearly, based on that choice alone, they were not managed accurately as no one would ever consider staying at a night club. The owners complete lack of care for the actual experience of his guests and sole focus on his doing a good job in managing expectations was such misplaced energy.   I will spare you more of the horrible details of what proceeded. A few lowlights  *having the owner call me at 11:00pm and 5:33am to make sure I would pay the remainder of my bill. (They got worried we would skip out on paying the balance) *In the AM, prior to our flights, the staff was instructed to lock the gate & not let my group out out so that we would not leave without paying the balance of the invoice!! *the owner personally threatened me   As I mentioned I’ve stayed here 5 times prior and have know management for over 10 years, which made all this even more painful and shocking. It seems that they are aware of the immense of what’s to come for their property and riding it to zero, without any care for their customers experience.   This property IS a gem and the staff  (Outside of the owners) that work on site are indeed wonderful, however as long as there is an operating club next door - this can not be treated as a hotel. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP or have a noise free stay here. The music = noise with heavy bass and the volume is loader than being at a concert.   It was important that I shared this to ensure that no one else have this type of stay. It felt like torture.   I am so sorry that this is happening to Olas however after how the owners treated my group, I can’t help but think that this might be a bit of karma.",50,190

"Just returned to Olas after 10yrs- and the upgrades still ticked all our boxes- beautiful, essentially private beach, peaceful setting, and and eco-friendly, small footprint.  We stayed in the ocean suite with balcony. The room was simple yet spacious. Loved the view, breeze, and sound of waves with the sunrise stirring us awake in the morning (easy transition to the balcony hammock). The staff was very nice and so helpful with excursion recommendations.Meals were so fresh and delicious. The sunsets on the rooftop with amazing jungle views was the perfect aperitif to heading out for dinner.  Won’t wait another 10 years to return!",50,190
"Everything was top notch. The hotel is perfectly located with jungle around it and directly adjacent to the beach. The hotel is a bit secluded so you get peace and quiet, without traffic and without beach clubs.   We stayed in a larger room directly facing the sea with a large spacious patio. The room was clean and fresh. At night we opened the doors to the sea and fell asleep to the waves crashing against the beach. The cool wind made the room always cool and nice.   Dino who received us was super nice and very helpful. He did that little extra throughout our stay. He knows the best restaurants and bars and really made sure we enjoyed ourselves 100%. It wouldnt have been the same without him.  Mari in the kitchen made the best breakfast every morning filled with love. Do not",40,190
" miss their lunch, it was also among the best we ate during our 10 days in tulum. Try their fish tacos, you will love it.   One thing that really made the stay great was that the breakfast was served around a large table where all the guests could gather in the morning and could talk and share experiences with each other. We had the opportunity to meet many new people we would not have met otherwise.   I recommend everyone to stay here when you come to Tulum if you want a nice quiet stay with the best service.",50,190

"I hadn't been to Tulum in four years and was excited to return. I'm so glad we chose Olas! Tulum has really grown a lot in the past few years and it was nice to be away from the crowds and action. The property is just gorgeous and steps from a pristine beach. Our room was lovely and well appointed. The hosts, Dino and Abby, were amazing and so friendly to talk to each day at breakfast - as were the other guests. It felt like a home away from home. Breakfast is included in the rate and their cook is wonderful - so much so that we ordered lunch every day at the hotel, too. Thanks Olas - and especially Dino and Abby - for making us feel welcome and taken care of.",50,190

Las ranidas suite rooms so amazing. The food is good especially breakfasts I had my food almost every day in the hotel apart from a local fish restautant -I think it's called camello-the yoga studio and the instructor (Victor) was awesome. It is one the best holiday I have ever had. It would have been nice only if they did have a live music some evenings. One night in tulum there was a guy who came from Senegal to play that was just great. I wish he played in the  hotel.  ,50,191
"This was such a beautiful hotel, a perfect getaway immersed in nature. The access to the beach is amazing and the water is breathtaking. My husband and I tried yoga and it was wonderful. The food was exquisite, and the best breakfasts we had so far. The dining area is absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning view of the beach. We loved it",50,191
"Perfect! I need not say more. Visit las ranitas. It's hard to explain you have to experience it for yourself. Carlos works the kitchen. Let him prepare your Grouper fish dinner, to die for.  The place is relaxing, friendly and very toned down. If you live in a big, busy city, this is where you want to be.  ",50,191
"This is a very nice hotel with better than average amenities but they charge you for every little thing and $15 for a margarita is pretty outrageous.  The front desk staff was friendly but provided incorrect and inconsistent information on several occasions that cost us extra. They provided an incorrect password for the hotel wireless, and although I am sure that I was not the only person who went back to tell them that we couldn't log on due to an ""incorrect password"" - they didn't look into it to realize that the printed instructions handed out to the guest was incorrect - for three days!  Made for significant difficulties getting work done and communications with the office.  No apologies, just an ""oh I guess we made a mistake"".  Food was good, but not exceptional - with an",40,191

"I looked at many reviews before booking our hotel, and for some reason Las Ranitas ended up being my final pick.  Although our room had a wonderful view of the ocean, I thought the location was a little far out, and the actual hotel was just average.  There was little lighting in the room, so it made getting ready difficult.  Also there was no outlets in the bathroom, so I had to blow dry my hair next the bed using my small compact mirror.  Overall, we LOVED tulum, and the hotel was fine for sleeping.  For the price, I don't think I'd come back to this particular hotel.",50,191
"Ten years later, Las Ranitas is still a super classy and beautiful hotel in a great location. The most breathtaking part of this hotel is walking into the main building/restaurant area because you are slightly elevated, looking down on a beautiful stretch of pristine beach with the most refreshing ocean breeze. I could sit here all day, it's truly that spectacular made even more spectacular by the fact that you usually have it almost to yourself.   The rooms are very comfortable and clean with decent beds. There is no AC but you definitely don't need it because the ocean breeze keeps you cool all night long. I love hearing the sound of the waves and watching sunrise in the hammock.  Las Ranitas is a bit further down the beach, but I prefer this part because there seems to be a",50,191
" little less seaweed (plus they diligently rake it up every day.) Beach chairs and loungers were always plentiful and you are within walking distance of many other hotels and restaurants.  The restaurant was uniformly good, with delicious breakfast and the best juices and smoothies in Tulum. Their coffee was some of the best we had in Tulum. Lunch was great as well, and I would assume dinner to be the same although we left every night for dinner. It's a more lowkey restaurant without a scene that you find in a lot of the other restaurants. I don't like mosquitos while I eat, so we avoided the jungle-side restaurants and stuck to the ones at the hotels on the beach side.  I would not hesitate to stay here again, and we in fact came back for breakfast even when we were staying at another hotel later in the trip. If you want a hotel that feels a little more local and a little less trendy, Las Ranitas is perfect.",50,191

"super cute, little nook in Tulum. Nice, locally-owned place to stay if you are veering away from the expensive beachfront resorts in Tulum. We stayed in the sun room and it was a nice little room. The window however would not lock shut for some reason, but we didn't worry too much since there is a security guy on staff at night and they lock you in the hotel grounds with this giant steel door. There was also a safe and a little minibar with snacks for us.    Our bed was a dbl bed I think, and for my husband and I, it was pretty small, so he slept on the couch sometimes. Lots of people in reviews complained about the club noise next door, and I am such a light sleeper, I actually did not have a problem. I wore earplugs anyway though, and slept very good.  In the morning we were",40,192
" offered free breakfast, and the staff was so pleasant. We had toast and eggs. It wasn't a fancy meal, but basic and I have to say– the coffee at their hotel was the best hotel coffee we had in Mexico (and I'm very picky about my coffee).    We rented bikes for some outings and one of our bikes had a bad rear hub that broke within a block of riding. I was sad about it, but the nice woman at the front desk was nice enough to refund us. On that note, the road conditions and traffic in Tulum are crazy, so ride at your own risk!    We tried out the sister hotel Coco one afternoon, and we were required to pay $45 USD in cash per person (or you could pay in pesos) at visit. This is really hard to do especially since we don't drink alcohol. Total rip, btw. When we got there they didn't like our bikes, they gave us a hard time about who we were, and when we got to the cabana, the waiters treated us like we were beach bum trash. It was a very stuffy atmosphere and we didn't feel welcome. The music also made me feel uneasy. When we went to pay, the waiter watched us pile up 1800-ish pesos, and when we handed it to him, he gave us a look and condescendingly said, ""well, I'm going to count it,"" like we were trying to short change them. The COCO experience was not worth it. I regret spending money there. There is a FREE beach near the Tulum ruins where you can lay on your towel and enjoy the space away from stuffy, Instagram trust fund kids.  Despite the Coco experience, Ginger was a nice little hotel was relaxing and nice and quiet in the day, and everyone was super friendly and helpful.",50,192

Our friends said they're rooms on higher floors were bright but they apparently good more town noise, too. This is a night-life (all night) town and bars have music on their outdoor roof-top patios.

"We stayed with an extended family and thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful and very well appointed villa that is part of Kasa Hotel Parota. I wish TA would allow to leave 4.5 stars, only a few minor issues taking away from a full 5 star experience.  Kasa Feliz is a gorgeous, well designed and stocked villa. It has everything one can wish for (except dishwasher). The bedrooms and commons spaces are thoughtfully appointed, the kitchen is stocked with every amenity, it’s truly a pleasure to stay there.   The location requires a car or use of taxis (we stayed as an extended family so made use of both). Breakfast was included and was excellent. All in all it’s a fabulous place to stay. The front desk is a very pleasant gentleman who was very responsive to our questions and requests.  ",40,195
" The half star I fell I needed to detract is for a couple of issues that may or may not affect your stay: 1) Wi-Fi is nearly impossible to use no matter how many times the hotel tried to fix it; Between poor Wi-Fi and cell reception, it was challenging to research and book activities, never mind work, as we planned to do; 2) the housekeeping (daily housekeeping was included in the cost and was needed for fresh towels among other things) was a bit spotty. They would not come the days the were supposed to, the hotel was not able to send at least fresh towels when we were out and would come in too late in the day to wash and dry existing ones, and when they came they didn’t necessarily replace all the needed items like face towels or bath mats. Concierge was out during our stay so no help there. Occasionally when we asked the front desk to call a cab from a location we were told they could secure a cab prior to our departure the answer was it’s not possible. So bear in mind that if you are relying on taxis, you will need to find a cab yourself on the return to the hotel. Not an issue but it was a bit startling after we were told that of course the hotel could call us a taxi from wherever we were heading to.  All of the above is very minor compared to how gorgeous the villa was but it did take away from a full 5 star experience.",50,195

On our last night we had to move from our suite to a standard room with no terrace. So the only place for us to settle in was the dining area - because no other area for us to go in the rain !

"Rosa Del Viento is no more, now owned by Gramercy (next door to the north) who also bought the little hotel Mistiq beach to the south of Rosa. We stayed there 3 years in a row, it’s still there and looks the same but there is a rope across the beach from gramercy to mistiq.",30,196
This hotel is currently closed. We were scheduled to stay here first week of Aug and I only found out of its closure by reading the other reviews on TripAdvisor 2 weeks before our arrival date. Hotel never notified me. I had to reach out to them!! They were not transparent and offered no apologies for their lack of communication and for inconveniencing us. We would have arrived without accommodations had I not reached out to them first!! They offered a refund of our deposit or relocate us to a different hotel. We opted to get our deposit back. I have emailed them to get a status update on our refund but they have stopped responding to my emails. They ghosted us. Unbelievable!,10,196
"Im going to Mexico in 2 days and just found out they canceled my reservation. Now I have to look for another hotel within 48 hours. How is this possible?!?! Never got any email, message or call. Has the hotel closed? No information on their website either!",10,196
This is not a review either.  This hotel cancelled our reservation out of the blue for our stay in August and can't get hold of them. Worst still is that they took payment for 50 % of the cost already and can't seem to be able to reach them.  That was so bizarre that they police taped the hotel and shut it down. That now seems to explain why they cancelled our reservation and not taking any reservations. They cancelled ours on June 18th,10,196
 Hotel cancelled my reservations in past few days only 2 weeks prior to trip.  Does anyone know if this hotel has cancelled operations.   Both email and phone are down?  This is more of a question than a rating  ,20,196
"Checked in, beautiful hotel, very, very nice staff.  We booked five nights due to the excellent reviews online. The morning after our first night, we were awakened around 8 am to police and another person knocking on our door. We were told we had to pack of “right now” and leave. The entire hotel was being evacuated. The staff did not even know why. There was police tape around the property, a big police bus, and armed officers all over the property. Even more disturbing.... when we called the online company we booked with, we were told they were sorry, and that this WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME this has happened at Rosa Del Viento! We were put in vans and mysteriously taken to another hotel. The new hotel was wonderful, but it was a very scary and unsettling experience. Book with",10,196

"We were delighted with our 5 night stay at this hotel. We selected it because it was the furthest property on the southern side of the Hotel Zone to avoid the crowds & noise (music and late night partiers).  Spacious and tastefully decorated rooms. Nice private beach offers full service bar and restaurant. Walking distance (via beach) or short cab ride to restaurants, shopping and nightlife. Friendly staff. Nothing to object to!!",50,196
"This really is a beautifully run hotel. We stumbled across it in October 2020 when extending our stay for 2 nights. We are about to stay here again for a week and are so excited to be back! The rooms are beautiful, the beach is quiet and cared for, all the staff are exceptional. So welcoming, kind, and all round brilliant. Free breakfast is good quality.  Lunch and dinner menu is huge and wonderful. I had amazing octopus one lunchtime! We had stayed at another well known very expensive hotel at the other end of the beach (cabanas) and were so disappointed as it was our honeymoon and the food, service and rooms were not great. Arriving here just for two nights after that felt like a holiday on its own. We are so grateful to be coming back and will always come here.",50,196
"Been coming down to tulum for years now and done it a few ways. I keep coming back to posada Luna del Sur because it really has everything you need in the perfect location. Nestled in tulum pueblo you are close to the nightlife, great authentic food and the beautiful vibrant local community. Such a magical spot.   I will be back in the spring! Why not? Breakfasts are great! 24hr security, wifi, parking amazing management and ownership to cater to all your needs. I will only come back to stay here!  Thank you posada Luna del Sur!

"Been staying at this place almost yearly for at least 8 years at this point and everything is always great. Always great to see the same smiling staff as it's a family run business, it really gives everything a friendlier more personal touch.  The rooms are nice and clean and cozy and breakfast on the rooftop in the morning is always delicious! There's always someone at the door to keep things safe and secure and greet you when you come back in the evening.  Tulum itself is also amazing, the sargassum (seaweed) issue on the beaches that was a problem for a bit there is completely gone this year. The beaches and sea were clean and pristine and the weather just lovely. Posada Luna is the perfect little spot from which to enjoy the gorgeous scenery.  No worries here, enjoy your",50,197

"Great service, wonderful breakfast and excellent location.  We needed a room for one night only and this was an excellent choice.  It’s within walking distance from many restaurants and close to the main highway.   We expected a typical free“continental breakfast” and were stunned at their menu choices.  It was a nice sit down breakfast under a palapa and delicious!  Thank you ",50,197
"We were in Tulum for one night and we were so happy to find this place. We were traveling on what I consider to be a ""normal"" budget (i.e. We didn't want expensive and fancy resorts, but we didn't want cheap hostels either). Our choices seemed to be beachfront hotels that were at least $300 or more (mostly more), or hotels in town that were much, much cheaper but had a lot of concerning reviews. We stumbled onto Posada Luna del Sur and after reading so many good reviews, we decided to make a reservation to stay here. We paid just over $100USD for the night, which seemed like a perfectly reasonable price for a hotel to us.   I will admit that I am horrible about checking my email in a timely manner, so I managed to miss the email that was sent to me asking for pre-payment via",50,197
" PayPal. I just assumed that I could pay when we got to the hotel. I had never booked a hotel on Hotels.com that sent a request for money via Paypal so that was new to me. Once at the hotel, they didn't take credit cards and we didn't have enough cash on us to pay. However, the guy at the front desk was very nice and patient and he still got us checked in, even without our payment. He took my passport to hold onto until we came back with the money (this is very standard procedure in Mexico and Central America). We got settled in our room, then went and found an ATM in town to get cash. As soon as we paid, I got my passport back with absolutely no issues.   The staff didn't speak English, which made it a bit difficult to communicate. But honestly, we don't have expectations of people speaking English in a country that isn't an English speaking country. I'm just mentioning it because it seems like some reviewers had a problem with this fact, so it seems like something that should be pointed out in case an English speaking staff is a ""must have"" for someone. Communication wasn't easy, but we managed and we were ok with that!  We were in room 12 which had a balcony that overlooked the side street that the hotel is located on. The room was clean and comfortable. There was a small mini-fridge and a partial kitchen, which was nice, and a large water cooler type jug of water at the kitchen sink. We actually really liked that the water was set up at the sink. It made it easy and convenient to remember to use the bottled water instead of the tap water. There was also a coffee maker which made my coffee-addicted husband happy. He likes being able to wake up and immediately have coffee running. If you can't find the coffee for the machine, we found ours in the refrigerator.  The owner has a booklet of information in the rooms, which includes a map and a list of his favorite restaurants. We chose one of his recommended restaurants for dinner and we weren't disappointed. We highly recommend Charlie's and their scorpion infused tequila! (I'm not usually a fan of tequila, so that says a lot!)  I'm not a morning person so I rarely eat breakfast, especially at hotels. I'm often moving too slow in the morning to make it to breakfast on time. So in the morning, my husband went to breakfast and asked if he could take something back to the room for me. He expected to get a plate or a box that he could carry back. But instead, they actually put together a plate of food for both of us, two glasses of orange juice, and put it all on a tray and carried it up to our room for us. We were a little surprised by the great service there and it made us happy. The food was also delicious.  The location of this hotel is great if you want to be in town, but don't want to be bothered by the noise. It's on a side street, just off the main road in town. Anywhere in the main section of town is easily walkable. (You will have to drive to the beach or the Tulum Ruins). We weren't bothered by any street noise which is a huge plus for me. The property itself is beautiful. From the street, the place doesn't look like anything spectacular. It just looks like a normal building. But the inside courtyard is beautiful and full of lush green vegetation and flowers, and the breakfast area on the roof is really nice.  All in all, the price was right, the location was great, the room was clean and comfortable, and the service was excellent. If we are ever back in Tulum, we would stay here again in a heartbeat.",30,197

"Thank you once again to Tom and all the staff for another wonderful week at the Posada, our seventh stay! The standard of the accommodation is still so high...the most comfortable beds, spotlessly clean rooms, lovely breakfasts on the roof terrace etc.  We weren't always lucky with the weather this visit, but having lovely accommodation made it so much more bearable! I must make mention of the map that Tom provides. What a lot of work has gone into this information packed map!

(Staff is amazing and long term which says a lot to me about the hotel (important to me) - I saw the same staff this time as 5 years ago, and amazingly, they remembered me also). The hotel does all they can to respect the environment, and while it’s not “fancy” or unnecessarily I pscale, it’s perfect in its offerings.   Tom has done up a map (which keeps updated) to recommends places to eat or see at all price points, from street taco bars to restaurants, and has done the same for beach spots also. You will Not go wrong. They have a long term relationship with Sian Community Tours, who we have used",50,197
"I prepaid for four nights and left after only two.  I was having trouble sleeping because the bed was uncomfortable for me and the a/c was noisy and blowing right on me while I slept. The hotel offered to move me to a different room but my back was bothering me by then and I wanted to find a hotel bed. It's a beautiful property and I enjoyed the setting in Tulum centro.  It's about a 1km walk to the main Avenida which is a real treat with all of the different shops and restaurants.  However that is farther than I wanted to walk for a coffee or a drink, as it turned out, and the hotel doesn't have a bar or coffeeshop.  And I found the room spartan for my tastes.  Tiny coffeemaker - bring your own filters and grounds.",30,198

Very clean and beautifully maintained. The breakfast was fantastic and authentic. The staff were all very polite and helpful. The pool was perfect for the kids.

"We stayed at LUV hotel there in Tulum Beach a few weeks ago and had an amazing experience. After walking up and down the beach and seeing many of the other hotels and accommodations, we felt that LUV was the ideal setting for us. Small, quaint, natural, and stunningly beautiful. The beach was wonderful!  Very quiet and laid-back, exactly what many of us want. They have a very small beach side bar with a wonderful mixologist named Josua. The drinks were outstanding and the overall vibe of the place was very understated and awesome.

"TLDR: great in so many ways, unfortunately construction happening on the property for the foreseeable future  My husband and I booked this hotel to get away from everything and get some deeply needed rest and relaxation. Overall plan for us in Tulum was to mainly hang out by the pool in the hotel and in the room reading and relaxing. When I booked the hotel I knew it was in a secluded area, and was okay with having to travel to the beach/downtown thinking that it was worth peace and quiet and not being near the party scene by the beach.  I thought I had found that when we arrived at night only to be woken up at 8:30 the next day to the sounds of construction. They are building the second phase of the hotel and there is construction every day besides Sunday. We mentioned it to",20,201
" the front desk and they kind of shrugged it off but it was honestly a huge let down. Deciding not to spend our vacation arguing with one hotel for a refund and trying to find another, we stayed and just tried to be gone most days.  Being gone most days meant that we either had to rent their scooter or take taxis. Both not great options. Scooter is fine for those that are used to driving one, but still $40 a day and I wouldn’t drive it at night, not to mention there is frequent rain in the Yucatán, and huge potholes in the road that you have to be extremely cautious of. Taxis are incredibly expensive, about $30 each way to the beach, and some taxi drivers try to charge you $40. You could rent a car but be prepared to sit in traffic, look for parking, and pay for parking. The beach is not within walking distance, and the road going to the beach is not the safest, we did see accidents along the one or two kilometers. At the beach, be ready to again fork out usually a least $50 to hang out at a beach club, or schlepp some stuff to the limited public beaches.  Now the good: all the staff were extremely lovely and accommodating. I really didn’t want to argue much with the staff at the desk because they were all clearly doing their best, the problems were the fault of management not staff. We woke up the first day pretty disoriented and just trying to get away from construction and in the midst of it my husband forgot about a reservation he had made for a massage. They gracefully let us have the massage on a different day. The property itself was beautiful and such a peaceful haven after construction ended for the day. The rooms were really great, we loved the king sized bed and the layout was functional and beautiful. Watching the sunset from our room (27) was quite magical. The cleaning every day was superbly done, and I really enjoyed the different towel animals we got every day. The pool although not heated, was great for me and I enjoyed the fact that either it was a chlorine-less pool or it had very little chlorine in it. The breakfast buffet while not huge was always delicious and the other food was great as well.  All in all I don’t know if I would come back here. Maybe once they are fully done building out the property, it will be worth it but at around $300 a night, it’s close to the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore in pricing and offers a lot less just to put things into perspective. Overall, I’m just so disappointed no one told us that there would be construction happening beforehand, and that hotel management clearly has not thought about what they can do to compensate for it for guests who have a problem with it and equipped their staff with those resolution tools. If they had offered us a free scooter rental for the length of our stay or a taxi credit or something it would have been a lot more manageable but we were kind of left to fend for ourselves. It’s so wrong not to mention the construction to guests beforehand and let them make their own decisions on whether they are ok with it beforehand or not.  Really all I wanted was to go somewhere to sleep and relax for a week, and this wasn’t it. If you are looking for the same, look elsewhere.",50,201

We have had our anniversary at the hotel and Arturo organized a bottle of champagne to make our special day more memorable, which was sent to our room in the evening, while he was also organizing a taxi for us to the restaurant where we had a reservation. He has been extremely helpful and nice during and also before our stay, as we had been in contact via WhatsApp and email for weeks. Concierge of the year award goes to him with no doubt!  Also shout-out and many thanks to Armando, our waiter in the morning and during the day,  who had been extremely nice!  We would definitely recommend El Pez to any other couples, as the service is just terrific on top of the very nice facilities and good location of the hotel. You will definitely love it!",50,202
"What a fantastic luxury boutique hotel! The setting is stunning- right on the beach and so close to the Tulum Ruins (a 15-20 min bike ride) and close to town where most bars and restaurants are (15-20 min car ride). The hotel itself is picturesque and intimate- just how my husband and I like it.  We stayed in a room overlooking the ocean , designed in true Tulum style. However, what really made our stay and time truly amazing was the staff and team at Mi Amor and Mi Amor restaurant. The concierge team- Efrain, Miriam, Seima, and Denisse were fantastic!- so attentive, hospitable and accommodating. They took care of everything for us! And truly made our trip. The team at the restaurant were also so hospitable and welcoming. The food at the restaurant was delicious as well. We",50,203
" highly recommend staying at this hotel if you're looking for more of an intimate luxurious stay!   Tips- The hotel has bike rentals for a very small fee, highly recommend! Also, guests of Mi Amor gain hotel/beach access to Le Zebra Hotel, their sister property where you can enjoy beach day beds and beach access in town.",50,203

"This place is a gem! What was likely a best kept secret is unlikely after many more of these reviews. We stayed 1 week here and it was the perfect getaway for a big birthday/holiday celebration. The welcome drink (Aperol sunset, I think) was a great beginning and nice touch.  Overall: Amazing property, well maintained. Always attentive and helpful staff. From the moment we arrived - Lorena helped make our stay top notched. This continued with everyone - Miriam, Denise and others at the front desk to Ana, Alberto, Ivan, Fernando (I wish I could remember everyone's name) and the rest of the team in the restaurant. They have personal gazebos to lounge oceanside in the sun and the pool is refreshing without being crowded.  Restaurant/Food: Good variety, nice portions. Always great",50,203
" presentation. As mentioned, the staff are extremely welcoming and helpful throughout. Prices were surprisingly reasonable for a resort property as compared to others. Is it inexpensive?No, but definitely not inflated. We actually ended up eating here more than we anticipated. Additionally, they had a wonderful Sunday brunch (just recently started) and a special Christmas Eve/Day dinner. Really added something special to the time of our stay.  Rooms: Very clean, well kept. We had room 19, which had a private balcony overlooking the pool and some peek views of the oceans. They cleaned in the morning and did a turn down service in the evening, always leaving some evening tea/chocolates.  Spa: We went for a hot stone massage and it was so great, we ended up doing another on Christmas Day. Ade, Angelica, Maria are part of the team here that will make sure you spa time is quality relaxation time. Definitely book some time here with one of these therapists.  100% we will stay here again and really want to thank everyone again for the amazing stay.",50,203

"This place was everything we wanted it to be. The setting is beautiful overlooking the sea from an infinity pool. The staff was incredible. Our first server, Brisa, made us feel incredibly welcome and greeted us by name from the start. I also recommend a short walk to their sister hotel, Mezzanine, for dinner.",50,203
"We had such an incredible stay at Mi Amor at Tulum. The staff were so helpful, patient and accommodating for all our requests. The food at the restaurant was amazing and the service too. I surprised my partner with a proposal in a private cabana by the beach and the staff assisted me with the surprise, decorations, photos and made it the most amazing and memorable experience. Definitely would recommend 10/10.",50,203
"Lovely hotel - staff all very friendly and helpful. Clean rooms and common areas. Comfortable bed and large bathroom. Tasty food and drinks from the restaurant. It was my birthday and the staff made a cake (looked just like an orange) and hung a Happy Birthday sign above our bed. Would recommend anyone stay at Mi Amor!  On the downside, the sorgassum seaweed was really bad this time of year (late May 2022) and we couldn’t spend any time at the beach or in the ocean.",50,203

"Where do I even start! Picture perfect honeymoon! I don’t think I’ll ever be able to top this trip and our stay at the Mezzanine.  We were truly made to feel like royalty. It was hands down the BEST experience I’ve ever had at a hotel!!  The room (room 10!) was breathtakingly beautiful, with a gorgeous hot tub on a corner balcony that overlooked the ocean. We could see the sunrise from our bed and saw so many shooting stars at night while lounging in our hot tub with delicious margaritas! The room was incredibly clean! We were provided with hats, beach towels, and even a beach bag. The mini bar had every possible selection of drinks, and some extra stuff we loved as well :)   The entire staff made us feel like family. So much positive energy around this hotel! We were welcomed",50,204
" with complimentary drinks and a beautifully written personalized note wishing us a happy honeymoon :)    Shoutouts to Seima, Alejandra and Abdel for helping us with everything from booking taxis (Miguel is the man!), scheduling massages, recommending amazing day trips & restaurants, to even bringing our covid tests to our room! (which we needed 24 hours prior to returning to the states) Talk about convenience!!  The food here is incredible!!! We ordered just about everything on every menu and each meal kept getting better and better. We even got breakfast delivered to our room almost every morning to eat on our balcony while listening to the waves :) Shoutout to Armando for making the best margaritas I’ve ever tasted! It was so convenient to be able to charge everything to our room and simply settle up at check out. The prices were incredibly reasonable for the quality of food and drinks!  I honestly don’t think this trip could have been any more perfect :) The Mezzanine was easily the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. We cannot wait to come back here!

Abdel and Alejandra, the concierges we worked with all week, were two are kindest people you’ll ever meet! Abdel greeted us our first day with 2 margaritas, a great tour of the property, and all kinds of helpful information about Tulum.

When it was time to checkout and go home, we both were sincerely sad to leave these people! It felt like home. They were more than staff, they were friends.

"La estancia muy cómoda, descansamos muy bien porque la zona es muy tranquila, instalaciones relativamente nuevas y en buen estado; sin embargo, el personal de limpieza es deficiente en su acción, ya que en los 3 días que estuvimos solo en una ocasión realizaron la limpieza a solicitud nuestra, misma que por cierto fue deficiente ya que “olvidaron” asear los baños, tuvimos que solicitar que nos dieran papel higiénico, jabón, shampoo, que cambiaran las sábanas y toallas, acto que en un hotel o en establecimientos que ofrecen servicios de alojamiento, la limpieza es imprescindible, punto que deben de mejorar para animar a sus clientes a regresar.

On first day our door frame broke, and after numerous complaints to reception, it was never fixed. We couldn’t close our door, so whenever we left had to close door with a kitchen knife meaning we had to take a knife out on day trips!! Spent 2 nights sleeping with a very loud water pipe above our room (jacuzzi upstairs had broken) which stopped us sleeping, reception refused to do anything about it and wouldn’t move our room despite moving our neighbours. No housekeeping through the whole week stay, no towels or even toilet roll top ups.

The rooms are spacious and comfortable very clean and welcoming.. they are located next to everything downtown tulum and even the beach zone !!  We were a group of 18 adults and we fit comfortably!!!

"Don't stay here if you want to get any sleep! We paid $350 USD for 2 nights in this little jungle hut. The staff didn't tell us that the first night, there was a live band playing DIRECTLY under our room and the music was literally shaking the walls of our hut. That ended at 11pm, and then the regular bar music began after that, which played until approx. 4am.  The 2nd night was worse because the bar didn't close until 6:30am. The restaurant then opens up at 8am for breakfast, and the music gets turned up in the morning, so sleeping in is also not an option.  When we asked for a refund after the first night, we were refused, and were told by the staff to ""join the party"".   We came here to relax, not to party. For $150usd per night,I don't think that is too much to ask for.  ",10,209
" All things considered, our room was clean, but it was also right next to the septic tank, so on top of not being able to sleep due to a busy bar blasting music until the early morning, we were also constantly dealing with sewage smells wafting into our room.   Not a pleasant experience, and for that price, we could have stayed in a quiet hotel where the staff actually care how your stay goes.   Would not recommend this place to anyone over the age of 20 years old, as this is clearly only a viable option for young travelers who are here to party.",50,209

Hotel was appropriate for jungle setting. Staff made it nice because they were so nice and very helpful. The food was very good and inexpensive in their affiliated restaurant. Tulum was interesting and I liked dining in the trees on the beach.,50,209
"Aldea Tulum is a beautiful boutique hotel, right across the road from the beaches of Tulum. The rooms are exactly as pictured, with a beautiful canopy bed and a balcony and wood touches that complement the location. Our one piece of feedback was that in our room the floors were not perfectly clean when we arrived (but again, it is a treehouse in a jungle). What really made our stay incredible was the hospitality. They bring you breakfast to your room, to your bed if you want or to your balcony. Mayumi was our host and helped us negotiate a proper price for parking our car, and she really went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was incredible.",50,209
"This room was exactly what we expected. Although there isn't A/C, which is the norm for places in Tulum, there was a circulating fan within the mosquito netting around the bed so there was a constant, lovely breeze. We stayed in #4, and the music from Ice Cream Bar and Casa Jaguar wasn't as loud as we were expecting based on other reviews.",30,209
"I was referred to this place by a friend but was skeptical because of the reviews!   Very happy choosing Aldea Tulum. We stayed 8 days. Our room was amazing on the second floor with a big patio and bottled water replaced everyday. Downstairs at the front desk was friendly staff that was knowledgable about the area for any questions or inquiries you might have. Good wifi. Warm environment to stay in.  Right outside the hotel was I Scream Bar that offered cheap eats and drinks wand a great nightlife spot for the evening.  The noise isn't as bad as the reviews say. If any at all, most of the noise comes from the restaurant beside the hotel and only on Friday. No trouble at all sleeping.  Access to the beach is right across the street along with a good coffee and ice cream shop.  ",10,209
 Should you choose to leave to go into town you can rent bikes for the day and take a 30 minute ride up the street to reach public beaches and ruins.  We booked through Expedia so there were two separate payments we made before arrival. No hidden fees as some others have said.,10,209

"The accomodation was really nice and special, everything was clean.   Access to the sea was good. Beach and beach clubs were very nice. Parking was offered for 200 Pesos per day.  Ice-Scream bar nearby and some sort of generator caused ongoing noise during the night, but was ok for me.  The breakfast as per attached picture was really poor. As there was no buffet, you had to ask for third slice of bread or a second cup of coffee.",10,209

"We had an excellent 4 night stay at the Bejuco Hotel.  The location is fantastic and spending a lazy afternoon in one of the teepee huts or hammocks is sublime.    As others have mentioned the rooms can be small, but that can be part of the experience in a small boutique hotel.  Our room was plenty adequate for 2 adults and a nine year old girl...and you are probably going to want to spend all of your time outside anyway.  This is not a resort hotel, so don't have resort expectations.   The restaurant is spectacular.   We ate there 2 of the nights and everything was amazing.",50,211
"We were extremely disappointed with our stay here. Beware as some of the best reviews here are for the restaurant, not for the hotel. We booked and prepaid a cabin for six nights at 220$ each and felt like we wasted a big part of our travel budget on this overpriced place. Just for the sake of comparison: You can get a spacious nice room in tulum city and a rental car for less than 100$ per night. Nothing about this hotel is thought through. The cabins are squeezed in between a noisy street and the entrance to the restaurant which plays loud music until 11pm. Our muggy cabin had two windows - one facing a maintenance corner next to the restaurant.   We only spent one of the planned and prepaid six nights here and managed to get a refund for two at least. ",10,211
Overpriced. Smelly old and small. This is not a hotel. There is no reception nothing. No one to give you any information. We arrived before check in hours. There was no such urgency or anything to make sure we get our room early. I understand hotels have check in hours but most hotels would try to accommodate you as soon as they can. There is no such thing as hospitality at all in this place. Nowhere to put you bags. The guy who runs the “hotel” came later than 3pm and start check us in. Asked me for y credit card again. I said I already paid 475$ USD on expedia he still charged me 150$ more now my bank is going on arbitration to get y money back. Seriously this ruined my last day in Tulum. Yes the pictures are cute but don’t stay here. Maybe get a drink but you don’t need to,10,211
 stay here this is an overpriced place. There are better boutique hotels around with so much to offer. Check reviews always before you book anything. That was my mistake but lesson learned from now on. Don’t let pictures deceive you. I put a picture of the room I don’t have pictures of the horrible bathroom. It’s makes noise at night the sink and the shower has no place to put your shampoo or anything. Very uncomfortable. It didn’t have outlets either. It was so bad!  ,10,211

"We stayed in the hotel for two nights and we were really disappointed.   The room was old, really small, loud (directly at the street with bad windows so therefore we didn't find a lot of sleep). In addition the bathroom had only about 2 m2 and taller people have some problems to sit on the toilet...there was also a terrible chemical smell in it.   The only positive thing is the restaurant...the location is well decorated and the food for dinner is really good. Unfortunately the breakfast was not the same standard and was very poor.  All these things wouldn't be so bad and would be acceptable if the night would cost 70 USD.   BUT FOR 300 USD PER NIGHT?! This feels like a bad joke and we don't recommend this hotel to anybody for that price! It is totally overcharged! ",10,211
OMG !! it was so fun and the food was absolutely awesome.  We made a reservation for a tiki hut looking at the ocean it was perfect.  After dinner we hung out in the hammocks.  What a unique experience.  Worth it.,40,211
"They overcharged us by $400 to $500 and do not respond to our request for details: Bejuco was our last accommodation on our Tulum adventure so we wanted to end in style. We splurged on the ""Master Suite Ocean Front"" which was no suite at all. I guess by suite they meant we got a door-less bathroom (no fridge) and by ocean front they meant that we had a views of water from our patio directly above the bar. The name of the room was misleading but even more so was the costs. Our booking was for $1775 USD for 3 nights + 16% VAT($280) and 3%($53) city tax = $2,100. All reasonable and as Canadians we budgeted for $2,500 CAD assuming 1.20 exchange rate in January. We were unhappy to see our credit card charge for $2998 upon our return home and reached out to the hotel to see if perhaps",50,211
" they double charged us for some of the meals we had, which were good but ridiculously overpriced (go to El Asadero for way better food at a fraction of the price).  We traveled at the beginning of February and at time of writing this review it is March 13th and 6 emails later. They refuse to provide us with the details of the charges. Even if the highest exchange rate was used through February, we should still not have been over $2,600 which, by the way, is far too much for their misleading ""Master Suite"".  So I caution anyone planning at stay at this hotel to watch their charges, lower your room expectations, and get a breakdown of your bill when at the hotel as they will not respond to you after the fact. We will not be staying there again.  Yours truly, A disappointed, Tulum regular, just trying to get an explanation, Mr. Rosa",50,211
"Decent and super simple rooms with great AC and good wifi. Really affordable if you’re just looking for a spot to sleep while venturing into Tulum. Came here for a few nights for the New Year because I was stuck and needed a place to stay ASAP!   Found this little spot and went to check it out. Quite far down the strip so I would recommend renting a bike from a nearby hotel to get around (trust me, it’s worth it). You can lock it on the stairs inside. Or else, rent a car to get around the zone and into Centro (taxis WILL extort you over in Tulum)  Also, a good pair of headphones would be recommended as there was constructions happening in the lot next door (might be done by the time you visit).   Great communication from the staff whenever I had a questions, they were always",40,212
"Okay so the hotel itself looks really nice and had great reviews. But my boyfriend and I booked this place and it was horrible. The walls are so thin I heard the people in the room next to me cough as if they were in my room. The ceiling creeks everytime someone takes a step. Also the rooms are SO SMALL. The room with twin beds is as small as a closet. With the size and noise I could not fall asleep. I awoke to the sound of cleaning people brooming outside my door at 7 am.   I asked to cancel after one night and they absolutely refused even though we hadn't even checked in yet. I asked for a larger room and they said they were booked. In response to the noise, they offered ear plugs and said many people were asking for ear plugs in case we needed some. This place sucks. Not",10,213

I double checked with them before coming to tulum after reading reviews of other peoples bad luck. Even when i got a written confirmation from the management i still got scammed out of my room and my refund.  The management is doing business out of peoples bookings. This is not a one-off case. This happened to me and the person checking in just before me. Reading online, it seems that this is a normal thing for this hotel.  YOU WILL NOT GET REFUNDED. STAY AWAY.",20,213

After check-in, we discovered that the villa did not have a back door that locked. The keypad to the front door was also not working, so only way in and out of the villa  was through the back door (that did not lock) or through a front window (that also did not lock). The hotel claimed that they had no other rooms available. Later they claimed that even if they had another room available, none of the them had back doors with operable locks, so they offered to refund us for our stay. We took them at their word and left, as we could not stay in a villa that had no operable locks. I spent three months calling and emailing the hotel regarding",50,213

We immediately started searching for new accommodations in Tulum and stumbled upon this unique and lovely hotel. The service could not have been better. Manon is delightful-so friendly, helpful, and genuine. Her thoughtful touches made our stay so memorable. We were sad to say good-bye to her when the time came to leave! Alice is also wonderful. We didn’t see her as much since she mostly worked evenings, but she is just as unassuming, humble, and kind as Manon. The 2 of them could not be better ambassadors for",50,213

The swimming pool is an added bonus, as is the Hun high above the jungle. The location is outstanding. We could walk in either direction and find delicious restaurants, sorbet stands, coffee spots, shops, ATMs and money exchanges. The beach club the hotel partners with is just across the street, and we were welcomed there just like their own guests were. The hotel’s restaurant is wonderful. The sushi chef there made our delicious breakfast to order every morning. We could not have had a better start to our days! If you are looking for a quiet, lovely, reasonably-priced hotel that caters to its guests and is situated within walking distance of any number of great restaurants and amenities, this is the one!

We had 2 kids with us and the hotel suited us perfectly! The common area for drinks in the evening with the open air is amazing and breakfast was superb! Yogurt and granola to start, coffee and juice then a full main course- omelet, or hot cakes or a traditional option were our choices (SO GOOD!!). This made for a perfect start to the day. The bar tender makes a fantastic margarita! The best we’ve had in Mexico. Thank you for everything! We look forward to visiting again",10,215
"I stayed in the most basic cabanas for six days and it was great. But be prepared, you are not in one of the big Hotels of Cancun. So there's no luxury at all.  For me that included shared bathrooms and showers. One advice for the showers, if you take one in the afternoon, the water is warmer. Also the service is friendly and not fast. I you are on a rush, don't go to this place.  But if you want to relax, be very close to the beach, and a 15 minutes walks to the Tulum ruins, this is the place.  Also, the sound of the ocean (and local fauna) can be unsettling for the first night of your stay.",40,216
"This place actually exceeded my expectations for the cabanas. I was expecting a camping like experience near the beach. We were rarely in the cabanas except to sleep, but we got restful sleep. The beds were pretty cozy, but they only have sheets, no blankets. Because of this I would bring some warm pajamas in case the nights are cold. We did have a couple cold nights and had some warmer things to wear. Most of the time though it was not needed.  The cabana was clean when we got to it, there was soap, shampoo, extra tp and towels for our personal bathroom. You do not get cleaning in the cabanas unless you ask for it. We did not ask for cleaning while we stayed there. I can understand why they do this for the cabanas as the amount of sand that collects is a lot.  The proximity to",50,216
" the beach is great and I loved it. I would recommend a few nights in the cabanas, we stayed 5 and I feel that was too long as we really liked a normal shower. There is also the super touristy area about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. This makes getting cash and supplies really easy. This is also where the ruins are.  When I booked we weren't sure about security, but they have locks etc on the doors and this exceeded my expectations. The cabana was also cleaner than I had expected.  Not having wifi in the cabanas is not really a big deal, it actually made the main area and bar really lively since people went there for wifi.  The restaurant  attached to the hotel was a great experience. All the waiters (day and night) were very nice and helpful. They all spoke pretty decent english too! I had no issues giving him tips as they were usually pretty prompt about getting things to you and I never had an order messed up. I definitely recommend chilling at the restaurant at night.  Overall a great experience in the little cabanas, will be returning when we visit tulum in the future.",10,216

"Poor service, (shockingly) poor cabanas, poor amenities, but amazing location! We were somewhat deceived by the photos - our cabana was literally just a bed- it didn't even have curtains so people walking by could see in. No fan either and the front desk said they were ""out"" of fans. Womens showers were cold and the lights weren't working? We left after one night and are not high maintenance people.",40,216
Fabulous robinson Crusoe like place. Loved it. Peaceful sanctuary just what I needed. Basic cabana stones throw from beautiful peaceful beach where i practiced hug A every morning. Staff were friendly and helpful. Loved the simplicity of the place. It does however need to.offer refillable water as only option for drinking water is buy small 20 peso plastic bottles of it - not enviro friendly.,20,216
Lovely place which  has amazing beach access to a dream beach .It is rustic but heavenly.It could be improved by a few tiny measures.Lights in shower blocks need improving .At least some hooks on walls to hang towels/swimsuits.A small brush in each cabana for sand .,10,216
The hotel has a very good location (close to Tulum) but The rooms are not  clean and the absence of air con and swimming pool is really painful. I thought the price was too high for the service. No drinking water available!!!! That does not fit with the price!,10,216
"Sorry to say, but this place is not worth the money. We stayed in a small cabana with a bed that was to small for two people to sleep in. The bed was also to short. We’re not tall people but the feet were almost out of the bed.   The house was very small with no place to sit and just one fan that hardly worked.  Only one power outlet where the fan had to be and that was a problem because you have no electricity during daytime, so the only time you can charge your phone or computer is during night time. Okay, they have some charger outlets in the reception area, but they were occupied almost all the time.  The shower had cold water, which was okay for us, but it the water pressure was poor. There was hardly any water running. The floor in the house had a floor was very slippery",50,216
" if you had wet feet and I fell and got hurt badly in my back. When I told the man in the reception that when we checked out, he didn’t offer me any compensation.   The service in the restaurant was okay and so was the food. The beach is nice, but unfortunately there were algae in the water, so we could not swim.   One more thing that was good was that we had walking distance to the Maya ruins.   This was not a good start on our vacation in Mexico, but fortunately we found a much better place to stay where we got value for our money and a pleasant stay.   I feel sorry giving such a bad review cause the people who worked there tried their best.  ",40,216
"We’ve visited La Launa for 1 day every year since 2012 during our  Rivera Maya vacation.  It is always a highlight of our trip.  The beach and service are unsurpassed.  Unfortunately, the lunch menu is now focused on Italian food vice seafood.  While the food this year was OK, it really was much better in years past. We miss the superb shrimp cocktail and fish tacos.  That being said, if you are visiting for the beach then La Luna is a great choice for a day trip from Playa del Carmen.",40,217
"I stayed here for the past two days. The rooms were clean and spacious, I stayed in a king bed  on the first floor and there were attachments for a hammock. The room is exactly what I was expecting and paid for, nothing fancy but very quaint. If you rather, you can bring your own pillow sheet. The hot water works, just use the right knobs (marked F). The best part was the location, very near to a great restaurant called El Asador (try the arrechera) and plenty of street food carts at nighttime. Make sure to rent a bike AND BE VERY SAFE since I saw someone fall off one during one night. The beaches and Tulum ruins are moderately near if traveling by bike, nothing strenuous since the roads are flat, and there are bike lanes in the main roads. I would come back and stay in this",50,217
" hotel seeing as the price was fair and you get a private room as opposed to the Hostel next door (Hostel Shek). Tons of tourists in this part of town and close to all bars and restaurants. The owner and his family (Andrea) live there, he is very hospitable and have good advice. I even showed up late for check-in (bus delayed) and although they were asleep they let me in. About 10 blocks walking distance from ADO bus terminal (make a left on the main road until you hit Satellite Ave, ten make another left and the hotel is to your right).",10,217

"With travelled through Mexico all the way down to Belize, had Cabañas with only a bed in it and power from 7pm to 7am, but this place was by far the worst!   While the owner is interested in your money but nothing else, mirrors exactly the look of the room. Shaby, mold on the walls and the bath fittings, no hot water even after mentioning it to the owner, a bed that is less comfortable then sleeping on a stone with needles on it. If you try to sleep forget it, you won't, the main street is right next to your room, if you try to shut your window, you will realize that you can't cause it's a wooden frame with stiff shades.  Don't ever go there, save your money and of course your nerves!!!  ",40,217
"My brother and I spent 3 nights at La Luna Gitana winter 2016. The location to town is among the best. Can walk a minute and be at the main road where you'll find everything! The owners are some of the nicest people I've met among my travels. We fell into some trouble and they went above and beyond to help us sort out the issues, including driving us around in their own vehicle and making phone calls on our behalf, (poor spanish). The place isn't 5 star beautiful but it is nice and very comfortable, theres a great porch above the street and location can't be beat being in town.",30,217
"For a budget hotel, we were quite happy with this place. We were in Tulum for a week and stayed here the whole time. The room was spacious and clean. The couple that owned it were super friendly and helpful as well. It is right in town, yet far enough from the bustle of the main street that it was quiet. The only thing lacking was the ability to lock the windows, albeit there was a gate that closed at night. ",30,217
"We stayed there in jan 16 and wanted to book online to avoid struggling finding a place. There wasn't many hotels available online in our price range so booked that one at 750 pesos. This isn't very cheap in Mexico (for budget places) and we heard people coming in and the price was halved, without even negociating... Which was a bit upsetting. Other than that, the place is nice and clean. The family lives there so you often hear the mother screaming after her kids. They don't offer bikes which is a shame as the beach is far and you have to cycle or get a cab. We walked it once and I don't recommend it!",50,217
"The management are funny and nice. Was very helpful. Location (if you want DOWNTOWN Tulum, not the beaches) is great but everything else was below average. Towels was a joke, pillows the same, bed was not really comfortable. Nice hammock area with sitting in the second floor up front",30,217
"Go to Tulum, stay in town. Make that your base, great people, restaurants and nightlife. Authentic and amazing people. Minutes from the beach or hang out in a cenote in the jungle for the day. I Love it! We stayed at Hotel La Luna Gitana for our 2 weeks, right off the main strip, next to a hostel. It was a super great deal, comfortable, clean, and safe. Bimbo the chihuahua runs security there. Andrea was our host, (his wife Polly showed up near the end of our stay) Both are amazing hosts, so nice. There is an inner courtyard, and second floor under thatched roof, a balcony facing the street, Andrea and Bimbo will meet you with a delicious morning italian espresso.  Do yourself a favour, stay off resorts - visit luna, take a bike or cab to the beach, eat at the amazing places in",20,217

"I came here for the temazcal and sound healing and OMG! The place is beautiful first and foremost, and the entire experience we transformative! The sound healing was great! Make sure you wear bug spray of light long sleeve shirt and pants because of the bugs. The temazcal was everything i expected and more!!! I got so emotional and I wasn't expecting that at all. It was such an intense, healing and spiritual ritual! I came out... different in the best way!   I'm definitely coming back and doing it again. If you are looking for a ritual to heal and release THIS IS IT!",50,218

Service was perfect, Everybody helped us anytime. Room was very big with Terrace, and clean. Comfortable bed and a perfect view  The hotel also has 2 amazing pools and restaurant with tasty Indian dishes.  We Will come again for sure Thank you for an amazing experience And a great time  Adi & Shachar",50,218
"Mayur is a place I can’t even describe in words, but I will try- my experience there was once in a lifetime. From the rooms, the food, the amenities, the pool, the Temezcal, the environment- everything exceeded my expectations!!! I love the rawness of the jungle and how healing it is. We had massages in the Treehouse that were so relaxing! I will be coming back for many years to come! Raj and his staff were super respectful and accommodating!",50,218
"I stayed in this hotel with my wife for our anniversary for 4 nights. Upon arriving at the hotel the front desk staff Sergio did an excellent job greeting us and showing us around. The room was nice and comfortable and the air conditioner worked very well (very important to have in tulum with the heat and humidity) breakfast was excelent (omlettes, toast and fruits) all made to order. Parking is small but available. Location is perfect. The staff treated us very well and I give a special thanks to Sergio for his assistance in making are vacation great. We stayed at the master suite which had alot of space and 2 air conditioning units and a balcony. We did see the inside of the bungalows and they seemed very nice but we prefered the extra space in the suite. Overall I would",50,219

"I had an amazing stay at Nativa Hotel. The young lady at the front desk was extremely helpful with anything I needed. She helped with recommendations around the area; the beach, restaurants, etc. I loved my room and plunge pool after a day out. The place was extremely quite and peaceful. The included breakfast was yummy and perfect to start my day. The free bikes at the property were great to get around the area. I have no complaints about this hotel. I found them hospitable, accommodating and super nice. ",50,219
"There was no receptionist and we waited for 3 hours for a security guard to show up. In the mean time the housekeeping person was alleging that my prepaid reservation was NOT paid and they were trying to charge me for the room AGAIN. To add insult to injury, after having paid for a ""suite"", they put me in the lowest category possible as they had oversold the hotel. Nobody from reception showed up the entire day even though the person was allegedly on their way the entire afternoon. The housekeeping person said that I would receive a discount the following day. Surprisingly enough there was actually someone at reception that offered no apologies or seemed to give a rat's a$$ about my experience. He said he could not offer any kind of compensation and just simple did not care. The",50,219
" hotel is described as eco chic. I see the eco part but NOT the chic. The room is barely basic and there were ants in the bed.  At check out, there was NO discount offered as part of decompensation and they said I would have to ask for it directly from the booking platform. The employee Sergio lied telling the platform they had offered me a free breakfast. The worst experience I have ever had in México which is very surprising since I usually have exceptional service every where. HORRENDOUS!! Please avoid at ALL COSTS!!",50,219

"This hotel and its staff are some of the most genuinely caring and attentive people I have met. Julia was available at any notice for any service and was so accommodating. She acted more as a friend (offering me tips, advice, sending me directions, showing me around the property, even walking me to the beach) than a manager. The service and property were really lovely. The amenities were also plentiful and great quality (wifi, television, air conditioning, private terrace). There are restaurants and pharmacies in walkable distance. I highly recommend a stay at this hotel.",40,219
"Great price for this hotel, the rooms are clean, especially the sanitary rooms. Wifi and AC are working great and the owner is one of the nicest people you will ever meet while travelling! I checked in very late and was pretty sick. The owner helped me and offered to buy medicine and sparkling water from the supermarket, which helped with my stomach problems. For my whole stay he was very friendly and courteous in all regards. Can greatly recommend this hotel!",50,220
"My partner and I had originally booked a hostel before we arrived in Tulum and we were so appalled that we couldn’t stay. We jumped on booking.com and found this place and I’m so glad we did. Just a short walk away we found ourselves in a great big room with a huge king size bed, great air con, really good wifi connection and the shower had amazing pressure. We were also treated to a small kitchenette. The only down side is that it is a short walk from everything (by short I do mean 5 minutes) but there is an Oxxo supermarket a 30 second walk away if you need it. Overall I’d definately stay here again and the staff were very nice and helpful. There’s also free coffee in the mornings down stairs in the lobby ",40,220

Air conditioners and wi-fi work terrific. Will definitely be staying there again on our next trip. Excellent all around value.",50,220
"The main issue was a strong chemical smell coming from the bathroom which filled the whole room, even with the bathroom door closed.  It smelt like urinal cubes that had been put into the pipes and was so strong that it made us feel unwell.  We were staying in room 8. The hotel is on the outskirts of Tulum - not really far but not so close that you drop in/out.  In the evenings, the last part of the street was not one I would have felt comfortable with walking on my own - perhaps just perception but I felt slightly on edge. The room itself was very large with two double beds and seating area.  It looked welcoming on arrival.  The bathroom was tiny - there was nowhere even to leave our toothbrushes - and towels would not stay on the hooks provided so we had to take them to the",20,220
"The apartment itself was nice but smelled of mold. Horrible service: no sign on the outside, shady neighbourhood, staff = security guard, speaks zero English, dirty pool and loungers (stains and hairs), we woke up at 3am from groups coming home from partying yelling, loud music, a girl who was totally drugged up was knocking on our door asking for help to get her the hell out of this place, she wasn’t even staying at Mudra, our kids were scared and we didn’t sleep the rest of the night because of the noise of all the drunk people. Booked for 3 nights, only stayed 1, tried to explain in the morning but the guard didn’t understand a thing, she suggested we used google translate lol…stay away unless you come home too drunk to care.",10,221
Our gripe from the beginning is that we were charged more than we agreed to for exchange rate. Only about $10 in the end but we won’t be going back if they can’t keep their word. Outside of that this is far from a finished product. They nickel and dime you for water and coffee pods. There aren’t enough clean towels (they told us to use the same one for the room and pool). There was some trash in the room at check-in including fake eyelashes from a previous guest. The pads on the pool chairs are stored at 4-5pm and you have to pull them out and put them away if you want to use them. All in all it feels more like a poorly managed apartment than anything like a serviced apartment or hotel experience. The building itself was nice but the touches aren’t there. My usual spot in this,20,221
 area is a hotel 3 blocks away. I’ll stay there next time.,10,221

"While the design is nice (Bali type), the hotel has some enormous flaws that make the stay very disappointing. First, the 2 bedrooms of our apartment didn’t have masking blinds which makes it difficult to sleep after sunrise around 7am (and the hotel claims that no picture showed the blinds, but have you ever seen hotel pictures of rooms with the blinds closed ?!) Second, the wifi was unstable and slow (even for Gmail page loading) Third, the running water was salty...  So in conclusion, it is unacceptable for this price (and no commercial offer was made) so run away and go to the youth hostel instead!",50,221

We alerted the front desk immediately and nothing ever came from that - we did not receive a refund or discount for our stay which is so poor. In addition, we made sure to lock our doors every day but every time we came back, our slider door was unlocked. This is completely unacceptable.",50,221

Location in La Velata area is great - coffee on the corner, yoga, close to main road, grocery, etc. But as others have noted - Mudra really shines with its service. The entire team is amaze - but the star is Rosy who acts as your personal concierge. Rosy booked bikes, restaurants, found cars when there were none avail and was also just an awesome pleasure. Thank you Rosy for making our trip wonderful. Everyone else: We explored pretty far and wide and this pretty clearly the best hotel in central Tulum.",20,221
"Let me start off by saying that I never leave reviews, only when I feel utterly compelled too and after my stay here I couldn't not leave a great review!!  First off, Rosie the concierge at the front desk made this trip perfect for my group of 6 people!! I cant stress it enough how thankful we were for this wonderful women, she may as well have been our person spirit guide! None of us spoke fluent Spanish and having Rosie there made everything so much easier, I spoke directly to her about our reservation through WhatsApp and she really went out of her way for us. She ordered our taxis, made reservations at the beach and restaurants, suggested beautiful places to go, went out of her way to purchase alcohol for our room upon arrival and then on top of all that she even sent us",50,221
"Okay, first and foremost, I have to commend the staff. Everyone from waiters to grounds workers were so nice and helpful. That being said, I’ll move on.   My sisters and I go to a different resort every year. Our sole purpose is to lay on the beach, and indulge in good food. When we got there, we went down to the beach and were horrified! I understand about the out of control sargassum, and the staff tried every day to get rid of it (not happening). The website for this property said that there was an entire mile of beach, with a just a small area where there were artificial reef barriers. Not true. There was a mile of concrete reef barriers, with a tiny area that we parked ourselves. When we spoke to the manager to possibly get moved to another resort, our pleas were not taken",20,222
" seriously. They were supposed to contact us the following day after we spoke to our travel agent. Didn’t happen.   This resort definitely caters to the “special” members, and being a non-member, we were denied several amenities. The tiny area we found on the beach, at the far end, had places that we could camp with an umbrella, but for the rest of the beach, only members got covered spaces. Also, we could not have access to all the pools because we’re not “special”. Plus, members could get reservations during peak times - not us.   The rooms were mediocre and even with every single light on, it was still too dim. My sister’s safe didn’t work, and could only be resolved with an appointment with security. Some rooms have robes, others have slippers. The shampoo, conditioner and liquid soap was horribly watered down and unusable.   One morning, my breakfast wasn’t delivered. When I called to inquire, I was told that it wasn’t delivered because they didn’t have my room number. What???  If you want to get any sleep, do NOT stay anywhere close to the Guacamayas Bar. It is extremely loud until very late.",50,222

The property is HUGE and has some many different pools, hammocks, beach getaways, restaurants, etc.  I never felt trapped and the restaurant options made each day feel a little different.  The restaurant by the beach felt like an island vacation.   There were 3 total resorts and you could walk down a beach path to all of them.  It was really great to have the different options.  The property is absolutely beautiful and well maintained.  Loved all the landscape.  I would go back here in a heartbeat.   We enjoyed the spa one day and were very happy.",30,222
"I recently stayed at El Dorado with family and a friend, the resort is gorgeous, well maintained and the staff very attentive.  We had a fabulous time, but had a few frustrating moments during our stay. The right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing. We booked Bali beds( bed reserved for extra $ by the pool), but when we went to locate our bed and start using, a staff said we didn’t have it reserved, This was extremely frustrating because our concierge booked the Bali bed and said it was taken care of for the requested days. Then the champagne that comes with the cost of the bed was  charged  again and we had to argue about the charge.  There were several times where we had to sign off 2-3 times for the same thing. So much paper is being used and if communication was",50,222
" better the resort would be that much better. When you have to be unnecessarily bothered for silly things on vacation it takes away from the experience. Also, things like spending 10 minutes picking out types of pillows and essential oil scents and then never received the pillows. Check out is very time consuming, so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to check out and look over bill. There are definitely hidden charges if you are not careful.  The staff was very kind and worked hard at making our experience wonderful. Rene Perez, our butler was amazing, he took care of our every request big or small. He even changed out our tv that was not working properly and brought us ice twice a day, along with many other requests. He is a big assets to the El Dorado Royal  Some other notable issues, lack of signage to where the Covid test area is located. There is little to no signage and it is on the back side of the lobby building. We were charged $25 for the test, but no instruction on where to go. It is a necessary evil to travel to Mexico, but it is a gigantic pain to have to worry about on vacation. Also, seems shady to have to pay for a test that is mandatory to leave.

The red flag was out for the duration of our holiday so a swim in the sea was out. The part of the beach you could use you had to vacate at about 4.00pm as the staff would turn the area into a restaurant for later in the day.

Location - at the edge of town nearest the beach (a 10-15 min bike ride), opposite a huge supermarket, and close enough to restaurants etc. The property has a small  but welcome pool, a friendly bar and some food. The staff are friendly and helpful. The outside garden common area was useful for our small group.",30,223
For the price this was good value .Depending on which beach resort you want to go to its 80 to 120 mxn taxi ride .There are some good restaurants nearby but the restaurant on site was very good as were the cocktsils .There is a very small pool which is refreshing . The garden was lovely and there is a shared kitchen area  with a fridge .,40,223

"We only stayed for 1 night and the hotel is very well located, only 2 min from the main street, rooms are spacious. The A/C is a bit noisy and white curtain will wake you up early.... Competitive price. For a short stay I will book the same hotel.",30,224
"We are beginning a 4 month travel stretch in Mexico so we don't have the budget  to stay in the hotels beachfront. After much research we decided on Tres Palmas and we could not be happier, not only is the price right, but the hotel ambiance, the treatment and even the employees, you feel exactly how you would like to feel at a hotel featuring the best Mexico has to offer- it is clean, affordable, has Mexican charm and al staff greeting buenos dias with a smile.  Great location in town, easy to get to the beach and to the center of tulum too!",40,224
"The owners treated us like honored guests (we're we?!) and you can't beat the location.  The room was clean, the bed was firm and the price was great.  Plus each room has a kitchenette with a mini frig.  Can't wait to go back!",10,224
"Tres Palmas did the job just fine.  It was basic, but very clean and cozy.  The location was the best part for me.  So close to everything you needed - all my fave restaurants and amenities.  It is quiet enough (quiet for Tulum...there will be the sound of howling cats and barking dogs, but there is no escaping that) being off the main strip but close enough to be convenient.  The staff were lovely, hot water worked as did the AC.  Be prepared - regardless of how you book - to use Paypal to pay your bill.  There is no credit card and communication isn't great to let you know about payment expectations.  Also, if you plan to use bikes in Tulum, do not plan to get them at Tres Palmas.  They ask $180 pesos with a $500 peso deposit.  You can literally go around the corner, walk one",50,224
" block, and find a bike rental shop that will rent you a bike for $80 - 100 pesos with a passport of drivers license.    That said, for the competitive price, I would stay here again.",40,224

"We had a reservation for one night, for myself, my husband and our two small dogs. This was our first visit to Tulum and we had driven a couple of hours after a 4-hour flight. When we arrived we told they only accept pets on request, which we thought we had done. As such we were stranded in an unfamiliar place. Not a good experience although we did ultimately find a place to stay.",10,224
"This is my second time here. I stayed last year. Thus is very nice property What I like about it is the location.It is not on the main , loud street. It is in a nice street not far away from many places to go .And the rooms are very nice and big. It is very clean and i love the big bathrooms. It is better than last year because there are more movie channels now at the tv. The bed is very comfortable and big and rooms are fresh and nice. I have a nice balcony which i love because i love listening birds in the early morning. There is kitchen so it is very good plus if you are gonna stay longer. And the girls who work here are vry kind and nice. They boy who looks after the things is very nice person .Oben , Oben is very good at what he does and he is very kind and helpful.I think",50,225
" the management should increase his salary__::)).oVER ALL i LOVE THE LOCATION ,I love how rooms are big and I love the balcony and the beds. I found this place from Frommers guide book which is tHE best trustable guide book in my opinion.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Well, here is a very popular fish restaurant near by and now there is nice garden bar restaurant at the corner and there are many many corner stores near by if you wanna by something at the late night. Also , this place is very silent not bad sounds .Only wonderful birds in the morning.i DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO ADD. It feels like you are staying in a nice studio apartment.  Thanks Oben for you rhelp.",30,225

"Located a bit out of the way, but that's why it is decently priced. 15 minute walk from ADO bus station & main strip. 20 minute taxi ride from Playa Pairiso. Free breakfast offered is scrambled eggs & toast with coffee & juice. No safe in the room. When we were there, they had freshly painted the room. There were still paint odors from the work, and later, someone came in to spray for bugs. We are easy going so it wasn't a problem, but if you aren't a flexible or easygoing traveller, please consider that the hotel seems to be undergoing upgrades. The TV did not work. The wifi worked very well when it was turned on, but it was off during the second night of our stay. I would stay here again if push came to shove as it is a great value, but I would opt for a place closer to the",50,225
 beach the next time around.,40,225
…,30,225
"Located in a residential area, the place is quiet with spacious rooms and  a nice ambiance. However,  since it's away from the center, you will need a cab to go anywhere which can sometimes be inconvenient. There are no restaurants,  shops  or an ATM machine within walking distance. I arrived at night and the young fellow at the desk couldn't  speak a word of English which caused big problems. I  urgently needed  information (for example, where to buy water from or get a meal) and he was, of course, unable to provide it.",40,225
"We spent 14 days in this beautiful hotel during our spring vacation in Mexico. Good staff, nice rooms, quiet and good sleeping. Tasty breakfast. Nice place to go scuba diving in cenotes, discover Tulum, Mayan ruins (highly recommended to rent a car) and beaches.  Good and cheap restaurants are nearby.",50,225
"Easy walk from the ADO bus station. Located just one block off the main strip in downtown Tulum, toward the further end of town. I was fine walking that one quiet block with my boyfriend at night, but if you're by yourself or not a comfortable traveler, you might taxi instead. Room was clean and comfortable, ours was spacious too. Breakfast was basic - toast and eggs, coffee and juice - but that's all we needed. AC worked great! TV in the room. No in-room safe. Front gate gets locked at night though so all felt secure. Great place to rent bikes right by here too.  Nice place for the price! If I come back to Tulum though, I may stay on the beach side of town vs downtown. ",30,225
"I found this place through a guide book's online page. It sounded good. But the review was a little bid misleading about the location of this place. This place in town and location is if you wanna stay in town for a longer stay not on beach is very good.  The rooms are large and clean . However there is not much natural light. But it is nice that you have a big room. The pillows were very hard ,that was not good. but the bed is comfortable. The boy who was working foe thunders were really really nice. I think he was the nicest part of the hotel. He was kind and helpful and caring.   However I have some some question marks of owners sincerity. I had two not very ethical confrontation with the female owner. She is the boss. I first wanted to stay for a mont ,she said for a mont it",50,225
"This was absolutely the worst hotel experience we've ever had - DO NOT book here.   We booked Arena Blue for our wedding because they were one of the few hotels that let us do a full buy-out of the hotel and get married on the beach.  Thankfully, we hosted our reception at Gitano (and had a wonderful experience there.)  When we arrived on-site for our wedding, they told us that they had re-booked half of our guests to another hotel which was at the other end of the beach - about 20 minutes away to drive.  Not only that, they didn't let anyone know in advance, so everyone had to make their way to ArenaBlue first, get dropped off, only to find out they had been relocated somewhere else.  That left the onus on us once we found this out to try to get in touch with these ~20 guests,",10,226
" apologize and explain the situation.  They also rebooked them all somewhere significantly less nice than the rooms they booked at ArenaBlue, and would not offer any kind of refund.  As a bride the first day of an exciting but stressful wedding weekend, this was a horrible first impression for us and our guests.  They were terrible to deal with onsite and gave us the runaround on this issue the whole time. They finally agreed that while they would not provide any refunds, they would allow everyone to come back and stay for a few days for free, and offered us a week stay for our honeymoon.  While we knew no one would take them up on this except us, there was no decision to be made - they left us no other options.  Many of our guests were left disappointed with their new accommodations and uncomfortable, some even rebooked new hotels and paid out of pocket on top of it all.  As icing on the cake, when we went to book our honeymoon stay, they told us great, send the dates, we'll book you in.  You can imagine what happened here... they went dark on us completely, and never followed through on their promise to host us for the terrible trouble they caused us and our guests at our wedding.  Additionally, we paid for a brunch with unlimited mimosas and beer, and they completely stopped serving alcohol and created a false line for our guests, taking 5 minutes to open each beer so as to stall the flow of alcohol. We had to go next door to buy more alcohol for the brunch so that people weren't just standing in a line for no reason.   Totally unprofessional, really got the impression they are just trying to make as much money off tourists as they can and don't care about right and wrong.  We ended up staying at The Beach for our honeymoon and had the opposite experience - best service, totally professional, first class. Overall, we had a great wedding weekend, but it was very much in spite of Hotel ArenaBlue.  I hate writing negative reviews but I hope I can spare others from wasting their money here - there are so many more worthy establishments in Tulum!",50,226
…,10,226
"I cant say enough about the staff at Arena Blue, they were so acomidating to anything we needed and very polite and friendly. We moved to another resort after a week because they were full over newyears, which may be a bit fancier but here your just another number and I luved the personal touch at Arena Blue. Thankyou so much for making our stay so special! :-)",10,226
"We had a good stay with them in July 2018, but to our big surprise out of nowhere in June 2019 they charged our credit card $2000, we NEVER booked a stay with them in 2019, they are criminals and rubbing people. We contacted the hotel at least 8 times. they ignored us and then we asked our credit card company to contact them, they even lied to them and said that will return the money within few days, it been 2 months and we still did get our money back. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!",30,226
"I THOUGHT I had a nice stay at Arena Blue Tulum with my family last November. When I booked the hotel in September 2018 I was asked to pay a 100% deposit to secure the 2 rooms, which I did. We had a nice stay and paid for our extra meals etc at check-out. End of story. Imagine my surprise when on 15 July 2019 I see that Arena Blue have taken money out of my account - more or less the same amount I paid for the reservation in September 2018.  When I contacted Arena Blue to ask why they had taken money out of my account 9 months after my stay I got a 2 line email saying this money was payment for the second room, “which was pending”. I replied to say this made no sense - my reservation said I had paid for both rooms in full and their own website terms and conditions says you pay",10,226
 100% upfront. They are yet to reply or explain taking this money out of my account despite me and others from my family sending them multiple emails and even calling them. Sadly it looks like we’re going to have to get a lawyer involved. What worries me most is that they still had my card details on file 9 months ater my stay and are yet to confirm that they’ve taken them off their system. It’s a shame that such a nice-seeming hotel should be cover for a scam.,10,226
…,10,226
"Very simple small hotel, no TV or phones on the rooms. Quiet place right at the beach, comfortable but luxury at all.  Friendly staff. It is pricey for what has to offer. They are very close to and have ocean views, but should bring prices down a bit.",10,226
"I just came back from Tulum and want to share my HORRIBLE experience with Arena Blue Hotel. I came with a group of 4 other girlfriends, and we rented 3 separate rooms. The Hotel itself is Ok, nothing fancy, but what I really want to share with anyone who would put a thought into choosing this pace – DO NOT!!! BECAUSE THEY ARE THIEVES!!! On the last night of our stay all 3 rooms discovered that Cash Money is missing from Safe Boxes. All 3 safe boxes in all 3 rooms!!! No, it was not left open by us, and it was not broken, all 3 boxes were locked when we discovered that money is missing. They took total of $1,400 USD. It is so obvious that the stuff that has main key to all safe boxes came to our rooms and took the cash. They knew that our entire group left rooms, they actually",10,226
We had a short stay of 3 nights the room was clean and quiet breakfast was just a minimum oaks coffee and a toast but enough the personal always gentle first night a problem with the AC of neighbor soo much noise the next day they fixed it and change our room,50,227
"It has big rooms and a variety of choices in rooms. The beach spot is small but nice. They have a great restaurant and a small but friendly staff. They have keeping you cool while you sleep, figured out! They are focused on ecology but not so much you get cold showers.",40,227
"Am going to go straight to what any potential guest might know:  - dirty rooms - AC working just for a few hours - NO WIFI neither in the commun areas nor in the rooms - staff not always available - no help from the staff - SUPER BAD QUALITY - EXPENSIVE for the service received  We quit it before our departure date and booked another hotel, and we lost 350euros which they reject to reimbourse at all.  Dont go!",10,227
"The location of the hotel is great, right on the beach.  This is a ""no frills"" hotel with all the basics but nothing more.  The room was clean but we had trouble with the air conditioning. Luckily they had another room available and we were able to switch.  The restaurant/ bar  had very poor service and was extremely overpriced for what it was.",20,227
"Facilities are nice and simple cabanas with great  helpful Staff, great beach and beyond great restaurant, our waiter was very attentive, the food and drinks were very good,  The sea food and fish were fantastic. We would highly recommend this place and will return.",40,227
We strongly advise not staying here. The rooms weren't great but the worst thing is that all our money was stolen from our room. There was no forced entry and a safety deposit box was not offered to us on arrival. Even worse was that on trying to report the theft to the reception staff their attitude was uncaring and even obstructive. The manager refused to come and speak to us staying that they were too busy and the reception refused to call the police telling us to wait on the road until the police came past and flag them down. Both the attitude of the staff and the fact that the room had obviously been entered with a key can only lead us to believe that the staff are aware and possibly involved with this theft. They obviously do not care about their guests. Thank God for the,10,227
" concierge at a different hotel who went above and beyond her duties to help us. Thank you to the police who were also amazing. If you do decide to stay at the ironically named ""OM"" tulum DO NOT LEAVE ANY VALUABLES IN THE ROOM.",50,227

"We just spent the day at the OM beach club.  We had originally planned to go somewhere else but did not like the vibe.  This beach club was great, our waiter was very attentive, the food and drinks were very good, and when a downpour came and everyone went into the restaurant, the manager/owner (not sure which) was very attentive to everyone and very friendly.  The pizza was fantastic.  We would highly recommend this place and will return.",20,227
"I've been going to Om Tulum for many years to enjoy at a day at the beach. I read the reviews before heading there this year. I was surprised at all the terrible comments but I decided I'd go regardless since I was going for the beach beds and drinks. I also had some friends from London that were staying there and to my surprise they were pleased with their room and the price they paid for it. As for me, the drinks were good, well priced and the service was quick and the waiters were all very polite and took good care of us. There's room for improvement and from what I can see, they are working on revamping the Om. One thing for sure, I'm not so sure about all the negative reviews they getting. This isn't The Ritz, they are the Om Tulum Cabanas, so it's clear that you are not",10,227
I cannot express enough how enjoyble our stay was at Luu's place on the beach! This is how Tulum should stay but it is growing too fast. Only the rich will be able to enjoy it before long but I was lucky enough to get to visit this little slice of heaven before it is gone. No there isn't any AC but the ocean breeze kept us nice and cool in JUNE! It was a great open air experience listening to the ocean all day and night. Talk about relaxing... We were directly on the beach with our own private piece of Tulum beach that was raked nice and clean every day by the staff.  We didn't want the commercialized experience. We got exactly what we wanted. There is private parking with gated entrances both from the street and the beach so we felt our belongings were very safe when we left,50,228
" which was important because I had over $10k in camera equipment with me. We stayed in the second story single bed loft type of room and it was wonderful. Luu's place is centered around many good places to eat and drink. It was an adventure we will never forget. The staff didn't speak English but we were able to communicate well enough for our needs. Our room was cleaned every day. I would stay here again in a minute.  What more can I say, it is just a beautiful space to enjoy the beach environment.",50,228
…,50,228
"I stayed in Lu's house in Tulum and it was amazing, the location is perfect for Tulum, you are in the center of the beach so you can get to the restaurants either south or north super easily. The staff is amazing on the property, I never saw them but when I needed anything, they seemed to magically appear.  The property is perfectly clean, super spacious, comfortable. I highly highly recommend this spot. The kite surfing is out your front door and the coolest hippest bar a couple of doors down. You can sit on a swing while enjoying your sunset cocktail!",50,228
"The Villa was perfectly located with close access to everything we could possibly need!  This was our first trip to Tulum, didn't really know what to expect and couldn't have landed in a more perfect spot.  The rooms were spacious, and comfortable and had fans that kept us plenty cool at night.  When there was an issue with the hot water, a team was swiftly deployed to come fix the problem.  Our maids came every day and were lovely!  The beach access is outstanding, with both a private deck near the house with lounge chairs and also loungers right on the beach.  The only thing that would have been really nice would have been a change of towels midweek as the salt and sand becomes pervasive.  But we made it work! I would definitely stay here again.  It was more than comfortable,",10,228
 and had parking and a wonderfully gracious host!,20,228

"I rented Luu's private villa for my 40th in October. I've been to tulum 8 visits and this wasn't far the loveliest accommodation I've had. Thoughtful decorations, huge rooms, a communal dining table and full kitchen. Maid came everyday. The most special part though was the beautiful back deck on your private little section of beach. Really a slice of heaven. There was private parking for our rental car. All of my favorite restaurants and cafes are a quick walk down the beach (no shoes necessary) If you're traveling with a group or family don't hesitate to stay in this gem. Give Luna, the house dog a pet for me :)",40,228
"We stayed two nights (prepaided) and would have left earlier. No electricity or water in the rooms and our roommates were crabs and cockroaches. The receptionist didnt understand any english and didnt provide any service. No meals, drinks or snacks were avaiable and it was not allowed to bring your own...???? Overly priced - seemed abandonded. ",50,228
"I too stayed here during the yoga retreat in March. I was trepidatious because of the reviews here, but because I was with a group I had no control of where we were staying. Negative review are spot on. The owner is a flat out liar and tried to get extra money from the group claiming we needed to make an extra security deposit (bless our organizer who somehow found a way to deal with her). She shhh'd us at 8 am when we stood outside talking in normal voices, saying there were people sleeping in the cabana next to us. Later I checked and it was empty. She stated we couldn't change rooms because the 'resort' was full. It was not. 4 cabanas were empty. This is NOT a resort. She wouldn't let us move to a larger table at breakfast saying it was reserved for a larger group (that never",40,228
The owners are really nice people and the beach huts are great as you get your own private hut with fly nets over the beds which are needed in Tulum. Complimentary breakfast of waffles banana and coffee was great too. Would definitely stay here again if we visit Tulum again!,50,229
You feel very welcome. We just spoke English and one on the owner only spoke Italien and Spanish we still had a lot of conversation and he tried the best he could to help us and to answer any questions. The dogs was amazing and I loved the fact that is was raining mangos. ,50,229
"I came across this hotel by sheer fluke having met the owners son on a night out. The location is literally a five / ten minute walk to the centre of Tulum which has all the bars, clubs and shops you could need. Therefore ideally located. The facilities are a little basic but for the price I paid I simply could not grumble at all.  The hosts and staff are the main factor here. They are so very welcoming, inviting me to their thanks giving and overall making me feel as if I was part of their family. I’ve read the other reviews and I can agree and disagree with some of the points made however I can hand on heart say that this is a beautiful, heart warming experience and one which I hope to repeat soon.",50,229
"Plus: Living room: great couches, comfy, with a big TV + Netflix, open until 11PM ish.  Kitchen: it has all you need to cook and nobody uses it!  Breakfast: pancakes or waffles with a piece of fruit or two is cool (you may ask for more fruits as sometimes you have a tiny piece, but I was never denied a ""normal"" portion).  Staff: always present until late, which is useful if you need anything.   Location: Not too much of a walk to the city + they rent bicycles.   Minus: Room: we had a cabana, the bed hardly fits 2 people of regular size, the mosquito net had holes and the door too, so mosquitoes/outside light were coming in!  Wifi: not working in the room, we had to go to the reception/living room to get it.  Noise: as there are holes in the door (middle, top and bottom) plus",30,229
" between the walls and roof, the outside noise was quite loud - road and people talking/partying til late.   Showers: there was no hot water unless once they turned it on for girls who had an early check out.   If you are backpacking or just need a place to stay and socialize without needing comfort, it's great.  Beds are really small for 2, keep that in mind for longer stays - or you might hate your partner in the morning for having to sleep all night half way out of the bed! If you like your sleep, comfort or need to work online (like we did), it's not great. I don't mean to talk bad about the place, a lot of people seemed to love it, we just have different expectations. For the price$43/night, I expected more :/ ",40,229
…,30,229
"We stayed 3 nights in here and in general we liked it. The wifi, the breakfast, friendly staff, location to Ado busses were good points. Our only complaint was the quietness of the hostel. Its right on the highway so be ware if that is something bothers you. And this is what they cant influence but there were chickens and roosters making noises starting from 3am. Literally we felt them next to our beds.",50,229
"The breakfast at the hotel is amazing, and the staff was really caring and friendly. They even prepared the food earlier in the morning for me and my girlfriend, as we were attending a language school. The hotel area itself is also quite beautiful. However, the rooms/huts are very small with little space for clothes. Further, it's a hut where a lot of mosquitos can get in. During our time there, it was raining a lot and our clothes were wet all the time, with no possibilty to dry. In addition, bathrooms were not clean and showers were cold with little pressure. Prices are high but for Tulum it was totally fine, it's just an expensive little town.",40,229
"It's walking distance to down town. Good restaurant around. 3 type of rooms tipy style rooms, cabin style and bungalows . The staff there are really nice and friendly love staying there. Rancho Tranquillo they do include a breakfast every morning. ",40,229
"We stayed in this hostel for nearly 4 days in April and loved the place. It’s simple, basic,   Very relaxed. The hosts are helpful, cooking nice breakfast of waffles or pancakes with fresh fruit, there is always fresh squeezed fruit juice in a jar for morning. Breakfast included into the cost. We stayed in a small casita with shower and toilet, it was quite spacious and comfortable, with TV inside! Just 5 min walk to the left you will find a great restaurant Barracuda with fresh seafood and many local dishes - you will love the place. From minuses - as in any hostel there was no cleaning and no one took the rubbish once, and hostel is quite a distance from the beach - 25-30 min cycling or 15 min by taxi ( price will range from 80 to 150 pesos depending on a day time and",50,229
"Almost no water flow. Receptionist could not find a toilet that worked. Man at desk held us up for 750 pesos for a crud room, then only returned 730 when we refused to stay there. In my opinion this is not a habitable place to stay.",10,230
I think we were the only people staying at the hotel. Didn't see any other guests there our whole stay. Staff were trying to rip us off buying water and ice cream so we decided to go across the road and got it for half the price. Restaurant didn't look like it was functioning. Pool definitely wasn't functioning but would be awesome if it was finished. It's huge! No water for showers which was a huge bummer. They seemed to try and fix it but it didn't happen. Had to sit in the lobby for wifi. There was a nice roof top which was good to watch the sunset but needs hammocks up there. Bathroom was dirty especially the toilet. Positives were the beds were comfy and clean and the air conditioning work. Not sure if I would stay again. This place has so much potential if some work was,30,230
 put into it.,10,230
…,30,230
"Its hard to find anything good to say about the place except the sheets were clean and the air conditioning worked. The location is good but the rest is dire.  The room was full of small red ants, the price was too high for the quality and the man at reception is terribly unhelpful and unfriendly and sleeps in the foyer at night. The food was grim we only ate there once despite having paid for three meals.  The pool water was brown and the whole place filled with building materials and rubble.  All very disappointing!",10,230
"The hotel's location is ideal, as it's located at the entrance to Tulum's Archeological Zone. The rooms were very clean, the air conditioning and Wi-Fi worked, but if you want to charge your devices or computer up, bring your own adaptors; all the outlets that worked were the old two-slotted ones with no ground. The three-prong outlets had no power, and the hotel couldn't resolve it. There was always hot water with good pressure. The pool they advertise is filled with scaffolding, as a matter of fact, when you get past the pretty entrance, you're greeted with lots of construction and renovations in progress. So no swimming even though they said there was. This hotel is in the old Mexican 20's hotel-bar style, lots of pictures of Marilyn Monroe and a topless mermaid in the",10,230
" restaurant-bar fountain. The employees' performance varies greatly. There was a young woman and a young man who were as helpful as they could be, and were splendid; but the (perhaps) owner and an older employee of trust showed they knew nothing of customer service or of the hotel-restaurant business. For example, I reserved our room beforehand. The hotel management was supposed to follow up with payment information. They never did, so I called the morning that we were due to arrive. Not only had the owner and older employee never heard of me (didn't recognize my name), but they didn't recognize my email or know we were even coming. Since ""their credit card machine was broken"", they said I could pay in cash on arrival, or by PayPal, and gave me some guy's name, a bank, and an account number. I had no way to know if this was legitimate. Later, when we arrived at the hotel, no one recognized me or my name, and I had to give it and my email all over again. They accepted cash in Mexican pesos, giving me 11.5 pesos per dollar, an exchange rate worse than I've seen anywhere. The next morning, things did not improve. I tried to buy a coffee at the hotel's restaurant, but their two coffee makers were broken. The owner sent me to a competing hotel-restaurant to buy it. Since we had stayed there, and I had tried to buy coffee there, I asked the owner about leaving my truck parked in the hotel's lot for a few hours while we toured the ruins. He replied angrily asking me ""Van a almorzar aqui?"",""Are you eating lunch here?"" I said yes because it was obvious that he still had no idea who I was, that I was his hotel guest, or anything else. When we came back, we decided to just eat a sandwich, and apple, and drink some water in the lot, and leave. He saw us and was pointing at us, indicating to the three employees that we had fooled him, used his parking, and weren't eating lunch at his restaurant. So staying at his hotel and trying to buy coffee in his restaurant wasn't enough to park for two hours in his lot. This guy has a lot to learn about customer service and the hotel business. If you stay there, deal with the nice young man and woman. Avoid the owner and old employee. They won't remember you the morning after. They promised to email my receipt; it's not here yet.",10,230
…,20,230
My boyfriend and I were excited to see this hotel as it was ranked in our travel guide as a good budget friendly option. We went into the reception area and asked if we could see a room before paying. Simple request I think.The man at the desk didn't even look up at us and just pointed to a poster at the front door with photos of the outside of the hotel and a room. I asked again in disbelief if we could see a room and he flipped us the middle finger. WOW. DON'T SUPPORT THIS PLACE.,10,230
"I’m not generally motivated to write reviews without some sense of reason. My stay a few nights ago at Hotel Acuario, Tulum Mexico was so disappointing, I feel quite motivated to alert others. I’ve been driving across Mexico for days (Guadalajara to Cozumel), and was in need of a decent shower and some sleep. Read about the hotel just across the street in a travel quide and stopped in to check their rooms.  What I was shown was clean and simple and quite resonably priced at 400 pecos (about $30). But I was hoping for something a little nicer and asked the desk for advice.  They suggested the Acuario as having nicer rooms.   Their price was 700 pecos (about $56) and I should have looked closer then my routine 30-40 second glance into the room, and I’ll nitpik to explain… On the",10,230

"I came here on my own whilst diving with Protec. It's a great location (1 street back from Main Street, couple of blocks from Protec) the rooms are very basic (no fridge, sketchy wifi, no wardrobe) but they are clean, decent AC and good bathroom. Staff are friendly although limited English spoken so be ready with your best Spanglish if you aren't fluent!   I'd think of it as a motel or hostel more than a hotel. Breakfast is simple - you have two options eggs and chorizo or eggs and ham. But you are so close to loads of restaurants I wouldn't worry.  In short - I'd come again for a dive trip. I wouldn't bring my wife here for a ""lovely"" holiday. ",30,234
"Good location, about one block from the main street, with lots of restaurants and local taco stands. Basic breakfast included was eggs, toast, coffee and juice. Room was a little worn and dated, especially for the price.",30,234
"If you're away from your room being an active tourist, this place is for you. No frills, great AC, nice flat screen TV and hot water. Spanish-speaking only front desk staff but friendly and helpful (140 lbs of dive gear up to the third floor). I'd stay here again if there was a small refrigerator in the room. It was close to where I needed to be for diving.",30,234
"This is a good hotel and close to the dive centre and rooms are basic but very clean and tidy so this was great for me. There is a large courtyard area and wifi, although it comes and goes. The breakfast next door was basic but good. Down sides: only one safety box in reception, lots of noise with drills going on until 2200 but that seemed to stop when I complained but as I say if your primary goal is diving and not staying in a fancy place, this is ideal",30,234
"We stayed here for a week during a dive trip.  The hotel's location was great.  It was several blocks from our dive shop and a 2 to 10 minute walk from most of the restaurants we visited (except a few on the beach and I would not recommend going to the beach to eat).  While this is not a hotel that I would take my wife, it was perfect for my dive buddy and me.  Rooms were small, the mattresses were hard but the rooms were very clean and the maids did a good job tidying up the room each day.  For a dive trip, this hotel is a 4 but for your spouse, it would be a 2 at best.  The front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  Also, there is a grocery store next door and a small fruit market 50 feet away.  A breakfast is included in the price.  They served OJ and/or coffee and either",40,234

Second floor room was wonderful which a plenty of light and a little balcony. It was clean and comfortable too. I enjoyed being able to open the windows to both directions for fresh breeze.  The service was friendly, wifi worked in the lobby and there was complimentary drinking water and bicykles for rent, too.  Good value for the walk-in price.",10,234

"Convenient, clean, comfortable, and courteous.   The courtyard setting welcomes the traveler.  Staff readily shares knowledge of the area in multiple languages and finds ways to individualize suggestions tapered to the tourist.  Staff also extended themselves beyond expectations.

Matias was really helpful The breakfast was grand - the coffee is ace!the atmosphere is great-the safety factor is tops and the whole experience is fabulous ! And it’s close to everything- I’ll return!!,50,235
"Incredibly beautiful, great service from the staff, especially Jorge. Perfect little oasis at a very reasonable price. I think at this level of hotel the breakfast should probably be complemented with fruit, but it’s a small gripe, it includes only bread, jam, cereal, orange juice, milk & coffee . I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",50,235
"The room was clean and nice, decorated with love, just few blocks from the mainstreet and 20 mins cycling to the archealogical zone of Tulum. Jorge was a very helpful and friendly host. We will recommend this place to all our friends.",50,235
"This is a little budget friendly gem in centro. It is scaled down to the basics but it makes up with ambiance. The garden shared space has packed in many Instagram worthy pic moments (think green vines, bikes, Buddhas, swings and hammocks). The staff was more than accommodating providing recommendations for food, beach and transportation.",40,235
"We stayed for three nights and really enjoyed the Secret Garden. Once you enter the gate the ambience is like a little oasis. It was quiet and peaceful, the other guests we met were friendly. There was no wifi while we were there but Matias was a wealth of information and also directed us to the sister hotel to use the wifi there. It was only a 2 min walk to the main street, try the taco restaurant on the corner, it’s great. We would definitely stay there again.",50,235
"We enjoyed our stay at secret garden hotel. The front office team is very kind and helpful and the location is quiet and very close to Tulum's city center. The room was confortable, but I would suggest to put more hooks and shelves especially in the bathroom, to help the guests to keep their stuff in order. Recommended!",40,235

"A friend and I stayed at Hotel Secret Garden in early September. The hotel is tucked away on a quiet street, a short walk away from Tulum's major road filled with restaurants and shopping. Beautiful cenotes and the beach strip are a short drive away. (Many people bike, ask the staff). The Tulum bus depot is a 5 minute walk.  The hotel has a beautiful courtyard filled with plants. The rooms are reasonable in sized, with stylish but minimalist decor and very very clean. The beds are comfortable. (Our room had an AC.) Drinkable water is readily available and the staff are extremely nice and helpful. Every room has a lockbox but the staff is small and the entrance and exit are closely kept at all hours.

"My experiences at Hotel Mamazul was incredible. The moment we got to the hotel felt an amazing welcoming and heart warming experience. The location and architecture of the hotel is so unique and beautiful.  The people working are so kind and had a high quality service, I felt so comfortable reaching out to any of the staff members. Food is incredibly unique and was very happy had a detail explication of how it is prepared. The mezcalitos were my favorite drinks ever. The best ones I have ever tried. Overall, I had an amazing experience and can’t wait to come back any time soon.",50,236
We loved staying at Hotel Mamazul…the hotel staff were so helpful and friendly. Juan gave us lots of recommendations and suggestions. The food and drinks were also amazing… a lot of thought and  quality put into the menu. We rented bikes from the hotel to travel into the beach and town. We would definitely return.,50,236
"I stayed with a friend at Hotel Mamazul Tulum from 01/13/22-01/17/22. Words cannot adequately express how pleased we were with both the hotel itself and the service we received but I will try.  Mamazul is a boutique hotel with only six rooms. If you want a mega resort with tons of people this is not the place for you. We stayed in the Quiote, it was just the right size for us and the décor was tasteful. Literally, up a flight of stairs and you have access to the lovely rooftop pool. Down the same flight of stairs and you’re in the reception area slash dining room slash lounge area slash Mezcaleria. The food is so good here people from other hotels and passerby pop in. The included continental breakfast is fabulous; sometimes I wake up wishing I could eat the frijoles (beans)",50,236
" that come on the side. The drinks are to die for, ESPECIALLY, the Mezcalita’s – try the maracuja (passion fruit) or the pepino (cucumber). Even though there are tons of options for eating and drinking minutes away we chose to eat at the hotel most of the time. The hotel is situated in what can be best described as a community of other small hotels, villas and apartments. If you have kids, fear not the whole area is family friendly but not in an intrusive way as we seem to find with larger properties.  The hotel is about ten minutes from all the best beaches in Tulum, minutes away from cenotes, minutes away from Matcha Mama (for those in the know), minutes away from the main strip of restaurants, bars and shops. You can walk, bike, take a taxi or rent a scooter to get around. We chose a scooter because it was economical and lets face it, fun to drive. The hotel can coordinate your rentals or you can do it on your own. The best way to get anything done and not waste your precious vacation time is to ask the concierge at reception. They will manage whatever you need and make great recommendations.   Speaking of concierge – lets talk service. The best part of the hotel was the service we received. Everyone from the cooks, the bartenders, to the concierge were warm, friendly and attentive. We didn’t get everyone’s name but we want to highlight the exceptional service we received from Juan, Lalo and Marcela. They are great people and definitely deserve some praise and maybe a raise.  My only critique is that one day there was a planned power outage at the hotel and we wished that this would have been communicated to us so that we would have planned accordingly. Even still, the hotel staff made sure we were comfortable during the outage.  Book this hotel.",40,236
…,10,236
"Beautiful hotel that definitely gave us the Tulum ""vibe"". Breakfast was pretty good! Marcela and Juan as well as the rest of the hotel team were amazing! Very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to navigating us around Tulum. They have bikes and motor scooters available to rent for the day, and a beautiful roof top! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was for two things, the bathroom had a bit of a smell randomly and there was no iron. Other than that I loved every moment being there!",50,236
"I'm sure the owner will reply with a politically correct response and not own up to their shortcomings and exploitation practices of tourism and locals.  But first Tulum we thought might be a nice place to visit. We did some research, my partner wanted to go from what she sees on ""social media"", me on the other likes to travel wherever whenever. We are world travelers an have stayed in nice places, old run down places, and bed breakfast hostel places. But out of all of the places we have visited, we never felt exploited, disappointed and left early like we did with Tulum.   But anyway this is our brief experience with hotel mamazul...  I just wanted to reach to you about our visit to mamazul. Visiting Tulum for the first time, as well as mamazul. We initially were delighted to",50,236
" make it to Tulum, also to mamazul. The place nicely down, and off the beaten path. The staff was inviting and communicative, well mainly the afternoon evening staff. They left flowers for my fiance, that was nice. So initially we were pleased with Mamazul. We knew that Tulum was a little different from other towns from word of mouth, videos and reviews. But once getting settled in, we realized how excessively overpriced, and lacking Tulum is including mamazul. Although your bartenders are awesome, and make good mixed mezcal drinks. The food we felt was overpriced and lacked the gastronomy taste pictured. Breakfast was included but was very bland and basic, coffee was like water. The next day of our visit, before leaving out for the day. We decided that Tulum so far wasn't what we expected, overpriced, empty, and just hypocritical of what the theme is about it's oneness and nature. So we decided to leave early and visit somewhere else. We spoke with your morning host, who tried to be understanding. We asked her about getting possibly a refund for atleast one night. We were within the 24hr of two nights but thought atleast one night would be accommodated. She checked but told us unless it's for health reasons or something happening with the hotel, mamazul can't refund. We figured this would be the result considering the hypocritical mentality and business practices in Tulum. But it was worth a try. So right after this decision, we relaxed for a few before heading out. But then our water was not working, so we couldn't shower. So that's one issue with the hotel. Thankfully we were going on a boat adventure so it worked out. The temperature of our hot water for shower was unpredictable and the shower head is obsolete. After deciding to leave the next day, we just made the best of the night in town which was fun. Upon returning in to mamazul, the next morning by 6am we had NO POWER AT ALL. Now I'm thinking maybe the power is out for a bit, and went back to rest. By 10am their still was no power , no AC (whatever), only cold water with low pressure, no generator, nothing. the lobby restaurant was closed basically although they offered drinks and something to snack on. But it was basically desserted. The was just hanging around waiting, as if this happens all the time.  So we asked your host again about the refund and issues, and she blamed it on the town not the hotel. Staying at Mamazul although a nice hotel and facility in concept. The money we paid for, for accommodations advertised was totally misleading and not up to par. If we would have known that issues like no water, low pressure, no electricity for hours... we Would have not stayed there. Maybe Tulum isn't for us, but for what is charged and advertised, we were completely disappointed. Fortunately we booked another hotel for Sunday and on, so we didn't have to stay at a powerless hotel that we paid for.   Tulum is a town full of hotel and restaurant chains, well off properties own by previlage foreigners and US/Canada people. Who have come to Tulum to take advantage of a situation and it's people. Ultimately turning the locals into corrupt people themselves. The whole idea of being one with nature, and preserving the natural beauty of the landscape is total BS. Nothing says respecting nature by development and exploitation of a land...",50,236

"Marcela and Ana were the best. This was my first time in Mexico. When I tell you these ladies went above and beyond for us is a understatement. The room was so beautiful, the breakfast was made from scratch every morning. Being in a place you have never been can be scary but when you walk in to nothing but smiles and courtesy every day it’s amazing.  The view from the rooftop was the best.  I was there for my sister in law and friends birthday and they put together fresh flowers and more all personalized.   The bed was comfortable, the rain shower was beautiful. If I ever go back I would stay here again.",50,236
My wife and I spent our Babymoon at Lamat and couldn’t have been happier with the service and experience. It started at the front desk with David making us feel very welcome and continued with the grounds staff continuously helping and ensuring that we had everything we needed. We stayed in room 204 and had the best views every morning waking up to the ocean and sunshine. Yoga each morning was a perfect start and the vibe was exactly what you would ever want when staying in Tulum. Would definitely and will definitely be coming back to this place,50,237
"I stayed here for my wedding week & had a block for my guests here as well. The location is great, it's along the quieter end of the hotel zone but still easily accessible to other happenings. We stayed in the ocean deluxe room. I don't know if we'll ever be able to stay in different lodgings - the balcony opens to this beautiful ocean view & the room itself was nice & spacious (the lights are pretty dim, but it tends to be the norm in most hotels here). The staff was very accommodating, & even if there was an issue it was handled with patience & understanding. The restaurant is shared with Hotel Panamera next door, it was an easy & delicious option if we felt like we wanted to stay close (My favorite was the shrimp tacos). We felt safe & cared for the entire trip. It was also a",50,237

The staff of course is the best as it’s associated with Panamera. We like to call out David, Fabenny, Jesus, Alberto as they all provided service to us. Our favorite lunch was the fish tacos and green salad. The event staff was fabulous with special events like Paella meal, Sangria and Mezcal tasting. We would recommend staying at either Panamera or Lamat to anyone.",40,237
"Amazing and relaxing. Our room faced the ocean and every detail was perfect! We need to find out what ingredients are in the Mr Green juice drinks we had every morning so we can continue to have them back home! From breakfast to lunch on the beach to dinners, everything was perfection.",20,237
Me and my friend stayed in the hotel for a week in December. It was a really amazing experience since the moment we arrived. David was a great point of contact that helped a lot during our stay. The only thing I would recommend is increasing lit in the rooms. Apart from that  all great.,20,237
"This hotel is advertised as ""chill boutique hotel"" but it was very hard difficult to chill and relax after a disappointing first night.  Granted I booked the least expensive room ( $1231 for 4 nights including IVA and service fee - $307 per night), there were numerous issues that were just unacceptable.  The bed linens were so old that one can feel the pilling .  As the room was very poorly lit, I thought it was indeed sand but it was actually pilling.  One hand towel was dingy, almost light brown with frayed edge.  The following day, the manager checked how my stay was so I mentioned the bedsheets.  Subsequent sheets had less pilling.  I also brought up the issue that  the room did not have any chair or drawers / cabinets.  I was told that the boutique hotels in Tulum are",50,237

Bunk beds don’t shake and offer privacy.",50,238

They were on sth all day long, but not in the relaxed way but in a very unfriendly, not reacting, super slow, annoying way. I felt like doing sth really bad by asking questions for instance. It's not allowed to drink your own alcohol in the hostel because they have a bar, but the cocktails at the bar taste like sh**. the breakfast is good that's true but I would never recommend the hostel to anyone. Maybe with other staff it could be ok but I really never felt so not welcome and not at home as here.",10,238

"This place is located in the jungle around one hour by car from Tulum and even though it’s a bit far from the main road (which is also a huge plus) it’s quite easy to find it coming from Francisco which is a little town located just next to the Tulum-Cabo highway. The place is isolated and surrounded by amazing nature which was super important to me after spending few weeks in Tulum that can get a bit exhausting after some time.  Energy here comes from the solar panels, water is fresh and clean, coming from the underground river. There are chickens and 3 amazing cats (one of them comes to sleep in my cabin and is the cutest cat ever) and I had a chance to see the parrots and there was also a tucan.

The electricity is solar, so no noisy generators running all day. They have a well with delicious water sourced from an underground river. Delicious organic fruits from trees that they planted with their own hands (papaya,banana, lime, coconut, guanavana and more than I know)  They provided at various times chicken, turkey and pork from the property - the animals are fun to watch and live a happy free range life. One thing I enjoyed particularly was mimicking the turkeys gobble when I walked by them to hear them respond in a chorus of gobbles.  The variety of birds that visit the property is vast.",50,239

The kitchen bar/is a great place to gather, with slabs of local wood fit to create the tables/chairs and bar. It's a nice place to sit and watch the birds in the morning with a coffee and a pair of binoculars.  Patrick and Cecilia took me on a tour of a private cenote with a friend. It was huge and we had the whole place to ourselves. I went on a few adventures with Patrick - viewing the local Azulik hotel display which is only 2km from Fransisco Muy and dipping into Tulum and Playa del Carmen a couple times to check out the city/nightlife.  The WiFi is surprisingly good for the middle of the jungle. (Obviously not as good as a major city, but enought that I could walk around the property and show my family the animals and the set up)  Patrick recently installed energy efficient ceiling fans in the guest house I was staying in and that really helped to fend cool the place down at night. They aren't too noisy so I still had the comforting sounds of the jungle wildlife to hum me to sleep.  It is really a gem of a place and Patrick and Cecilia were very gracious to me.

Great place! Clean and accesible. Really close to Tulum Mayan Ruins archeological park. Making a road trip around the peninsula and this place is the best so far. Though it has no parking place there is plenty of space in the street. It's a very safe place.,40,240
"Stayed here for 3 nights in a private room with my boyfriend. Absolutely loved this place! It is so clean and comfortable, close to everything in tulum but in a nice quiet location! Mario was so helpful and gave us so many good tips. Would definitely stay here again ",50,240
We had a private room that was clean and stylish. Loved that the hosts spoke English and that they were very helpful. Handy to the bike path to the beach as well as close to a large market and the action in the town. Great place to meet other travellers.,50,240
"Mpre like a family than staff, made some great friends here. Perfect if you want a bit of a party or to chill. Best rooftop view in Tulum! Cant speak highly enough of Quintana Roots! Also a great dive shop!",40,240
"We are so grateful to the staff at Casa Altamar and especially Javier, Erik and Arturo, for matching the beautiful setting with first-class service. My husband and I left Casa Altamar feeling nurtured by the delicious food and drink on the terrace, the simple comfortable rooms, poolside massages, rooftop area for star gazing, and kayaks for cruising around. Casa Altamar is also just a 5 minute walk to a cenote where we did some snorkeling and you can take a taxi to the Tulum Ruins for around $20USD. I'd also note that we traveled without our children this time but would love to bring them back with us.",50,241
"I stayed there for 4 nights and it was incredible! The rooms are super comfortable and have everything you could need, great beds, pillows and a safe! Also, a great view from every room. The location is fantastic! Views to die for and very quiet! A 5 min walk from a cenote if u ever get tired of the beach. The service was absolutely fantastic! Probably the best service I've ever had in a hotel. The food was delicious! A wide variety of options and at a reasonable price. They also have an excursion center runned by Matias who was extremely friendly and helpful. I went diving with him and totally recommend it. Casa altamar is a truly hidden gem! ",50,241
"This was a wonderful place to stay. The staff was super helpful and friendly - I had some lovely conversations during my solo trip. Many reviews have said it before but the food was excellent, and an incredible value. The restaurant has a balcony with excellent views of the beach. They are also very accommodating to dietary restrictions. The room was very comfortable and everything worked well. The weather wasn't great during my stay so I didn't do any swimming/kayaking, but the grounds were still beautiful for beach lounging and watching the storms roll in. Would definitely stay here again!",50,241
"This is the third time we have stayed at Casa Altamar. This time with the whole family! Me, my wife and two daughters (4 and 8 years old), brothers-in-law with two sons (6 and 7 years old) and like the other times we had exceptional service! Everything works very well and the beach is calm and idyllic! This is without a doubt our hotel in Tulum! We know 29 countries and this is one of our main indications to friends!",50,241
"My friends and I loved this hotel! We stayed over my birthday in May, and I can not say enough about the staff, location, food, amenities and more. The team at Casa Altamar felt like our longtime friends by the time we left, as they constantly greeted us by name, knew our ""usual"" orders, and went out of their ways to help us - I think every one of them individually even knew, and wished me a happy birthday, on the day.   The food was AMAZING! I often thing that food in Mexico is a little too ""gastronomic"" and not just simple, great food. Not at Casa Altamar, from the wood-fired pizzas and freshly-made ceviche, to the catch of the days, freshly baked bread and home-made granola, it was all simple, just incredible. We took a ceviche-making class with the chef, who was a hoot, and",50,241
" booked massages under the palapa - and nothing could have been better. Valentina, one of the servers, kept us well hydrated with margaritas and entertained with jokes!   It's about a 20 minute drive from the craziness of Tulum, which was perfect for us, as while we enjoyed popping in a few times for dinner at Heartwood and The Kitchen Table, we preferred to stay outside of the ""scene."" I would highly recommend this hotel, and can't wait to come back.",50,241
…,50,241
"Casa Altamar was so great on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. We arrived late for our first night and the staff was waiting for us and had prepared a meal in case we were hungry. The room was perfect: hot water, working AC, clean sheets and amazing shower + products. The food there was constantly great. My friend travelling with me has many food allergies and they went the extra mile to account for it. The staff made us feel at home from the very beginning. They were so kind and always offered the best service and advice. The beach had constantly azure water. They let you borrow gear (shoes, kayak, surfboards, paddleboards) so you can go out and enjoy the pretty water. The little wooden deck also allows you to go swim without having to worry about the seaweed. I",50,241
" could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you're thinking about booking nights at this hotel, just do it. You'll have an amazing time. Note that the hotel is about 10min by car away from Tulum and is in a very quiet and peaceful setting. Team Altamar, Thanks for everything:) Louis & Mans",10,241

"Absolutely wonderful! My wife and I stayed here in May 2022 and it could not have been nicer. The room was private and perfect down to every detail, especially the cleverly designed shower. And the food was absolutely superb. We will dream about those meals for years. The cenote was an excellent place to swim in crystal clear water with fish and hammocks. Don Carlos, Ana, and all of the staff were impeccable and kind throughout. We liked it so much that we decided to stay on-site our entire stay. This is an absolute gem and we could not recommend it more!",50,242
This review is LONG overdue as my fiancé and I stayed at Ajal in May of 2021 but here we go! Ajal is pure magic. Don Carlos and his entire staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was absolutely perfect. Every single detail of our time there was flawless. The location within the jungle is out of this world. The food and drinks are to die for and experiencing sunset from the sky table is an something we will never forget. Don Carlos pours so much of his heart into Ajal and you will feel it from the moment you step foot on the property. He even went to our car rental company in town to help us when our car broke down! Our only regret from our trip to Tulum was spending any time away from Ajal at all. We adored our time there will surely return for years and years to come.,50,242
 ,50,242
…,50,242
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. We were fortunate enough to have the whole place to ourselves for the first 2 nights. Boy, did we take advantage of that. We had an in-room message, cooking class and Sky Table dinner. The place is so peaceful and romantic. John, the owner hand-picked his outstanding staff. Each treehouse has been appointed with local art, and the wood for the treehouses comes from the area. I cannot say enough good things about this hidden gem. We will be back! Thank you Ajal Tulum for such a memorable vacation!",50,242
"Wow, where do I even start. If you want a special and unique 5 star experience without the hustle and bustle of a large resort,  I highly recommend you give Ajal a try. Everything was perfect, staff was wonderful and so helpful with anything we needed or wanted. Don Carlos (GM) went above and beyond to make our honeymoon unforgettable. Anna and Lux (massage therapist) provided us with the best massage of our lives right in our treehouse. And greeted us with soothing hot tea to follow. Try a private cooking class with chef Darian, such an unforgettable experience. Be sure to book a private rooftop dinner at sunset as well! Also Diego makes some unreal cocktails and is very knowledgeable on tequilas/mezcals. We even were able to meet and share some special conversations with the",50,242
 owner John!! I could go on and on.. but do yourself a favor and book your stay now! enjoy your stay with the Ajal family! We will be back for sure.,50,242
…,50,242
Wow wow wow! Possibly the most unique experience I've had the opportunity to do in all my travels. Our visit started with a private couples massage and cocktail in our tree house room followed by a sunset looking over the jungle from the lookout tower. Dinner in the jungle was amazing too. The next day we had a private swim in the amazing nearby cenote. We were the only people there! All staff were amazing especially Don Carlos. The owners were lovely too and we had the perfect holiday in the jungle.,50,242
"This place is amazing!!! It is located 1.5 kilometers down a gravel road in the jungle just south of Tulum. It is private. There are 4 tree houses but we only saw one other couple there. The treehouses surround the jungle cantina where they serve fresh, delicious food and drinks. Don Carlos, the general manager was so nice. He helped us reserve electric motos and gave us tips on things to do. Everyone there is so nice and friendly. Don Carlos made our cocktails in the evening with fresh squeezed lemons and limes. The treehouse was so awesome. It was an amazing experience. It's not air-conditioned and there are bugs but that is all part of the fun. We want to come here every year now. Thank you Don Carlos!!",50,242
"I just love Prana.  From the owners to the staff to the wonder ambience. The beautiful oasis atmosphere. the nice pool, bar and restaurant area. Great comfort food. Very helpful staff.  Always available to grab me some hot water for my tea, or a refill on my drinking water.  Can't wait to go back next year!",50,243
"Prana is an absolutely gorgeous hotel in a stunning setting. The staff is amazing and the lady at the front desk is a sweetheart!! We rented the suite which was huge and had an amazing plunge pool on our deck. The deck felt like you were sitting in a treehouse. Loved the free breakfast and all the food and drinks we had at Nido was excellent. Their cat, Nikita, hung out with us in our room and on our deck in the sun. So cute! Beautiful pool and very chill vibe throughout. Met the owner who seemed like a great guy. Can get a bit noisy on Sundays around the pool as they do also allow locals or maybe family of staff to use it. A wonderful gesture on the owners part....we just weren't aware and maybe should have been told ahead of time so we could have booked to go out for the day",40,243
 which we ended up doing. This particular day there were a lot of screaming kids running everywhere. Might have been an unusually busy day. The staff were very apologetic and we were compensated for the hassle. It was super quiet the rest of the week. This was my only reason for giving Prana 4 and not 5 stars. Great location off a side street and walking distance to the town of Tulum. We really liked Prana and wouldn't hesitate to go back. ,50,243
…,50,243
"An event i was attending for 5 days was based here.  i met one of the owners on a trip a few years ago and he told me about this place. Not sure why it took me so long to visit, but i am already scheduling a trip back for next year. The food was not too fancy, but really excellent.  The atmosphere was  how i can best describe as an Oasis.  The surrounding neighborhood is not fancy, and it does not look like too much on the outside.  However, when i walked in to Prana,  i felt as if i was transformed to a new, beautiful place.  An Oasis.  Lovely sitting and eating areas, pool. etc.  Can't wait to go back. From the Indian traditions i believe ""Prana"" can loosely be translated as ""life force"".  This place has plenty of ""Prana"".  Highly recommended.  Bob, from United States",40,243
"Prana Boutique Hotel was the perfect respite in the midst of Tulum. Upon entering this walled oasis, chill music greets your ear, a cat (Nikita) says hello and a dog (Flaca) chills out. The rooms are simple, comfortable, and private. Large showers, two sinks, and eco-friendly soaps, along with a pitcher of bottled water await you.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We got amazing recommendations for restaurants in town and on the beach, as well as beaches to visit or just great places to see the sun set. The restaurant in the hotel serves a delicious breakfast I still dream about. Two options are included in the very affordable room prices, one savory Mexican breakfast and one continental breakfast of fruit, yogurt, homemade cake and marmalade, and a blended fruit",40,243
" drink, always different each day we were there. Seriously, if I had that breakfast every day of my life I’d be happy.  The pool was small and cool and refreshing. World music playing was chill and not at all like some of the club music playing on the beach.   My wife loved the ambiance and thoughtful design. It feels more special than the average hotel or B&B. It’s a very peaceful nook, a home from home, and I cannot wait to return to Tulum and stay there.   Like others said, the free bikes are a nice touch, but mostly the friendly and helpful staff who are present but not in-your-face. The 24-hour security/staff presence makes coming back late at night feel safe as well. ",50,243
…,50,243
"We stayed at Prana for 2 nights and we had a great experience. Their pool is open for all night which was great to keep our little son enjoyed until his bed time. The atmosphere of the hotel was amazing, it makes you feel like you are in Tulum!  Their  included breakfast has 2 options: One option was Mexican style egg breakfast and the other one was yogurt and granola with dried fruits. Their options was ok for us but I feel like they could make it more flexible for guests. If you select something else from the menu then you have to pay for it. There were some other little things that could go better ( we booked the suite room with hot tub in the balcony but the hot tub never get hot and worked as expected. The owner tried to help us but we weren't able to use it.) but overall",50,243
 it was a great experience because of the atmosphere and the friendly staff.,50,243
"I stayed in a private room in Hostel Sheck, now Malinche for 8 days. My room is as advertised, clean, with plenty of storage space, and with AC. Good facilities, there is common space you can chill at and cleaning lady cleaning your room everyday. Good location yet quiet at night. Love the staff here, receptionist Gustavo is super friendly and helpful and speaks good English, we became friends by the end of my trip. Overall is a good BnB experience.",50,244
Staff friendly giving lots of good advise on things to do Room was cool and comfortable with air conditioning  Friendly dog included plus great breakfast  Bar was quite as off season not so many traveler's  Realaxing  spot but bring your ear plugs,40,244
"Booked Hostel Sheck because of the reviews and photos on Hostelworld. In the Hostelworld description it says “towels for hire” and guess what? There’s NO towels to rent. I had to walk to DayTripper Hostel to rent a towel as the staff is a lot more accommodating/friendly. WiFi was horrrible at the Sheck. Bathrooms? Bring a flashlight!! Walking outside in the dark is difficult! My bed had small bugs that would randomly appear on my sleeping sheet in the night. Not sure if they’re coming from the grass roof, or the big gap in the door. Either way i wouldn’t book this hostel ever again. My top bunk did not have a ladder, but all the other bunks did. To top it off there was a cockroach in our room. I hardly ever leave reviews but i felt everyone should be aware. Go to Lum hostel or",10,244

"So so awesome place to stay at Tulum, clean and nice facility... The best staff ever... Very friendly you really feel at home (or even better), awesome bar prices and the grill man! The grill!!! Such delicious and affordable food... Awesome place, awesome people, awesome grill and awesome bar prices... Just AWESOME!",50,244
Best place in Tulum for price range! We had a great time here. The rooms are clean. And the staff is great. The location is amazing. Great place to spend few days and absorb the atmosphere of Tulum. We will be happy to be back soon :) ,50,244
"Already in my first steps at the hostel, I've already felt very welcome by the place, with a pretty nice green deco full of trees and wooden furniture.  The staff is very helpful and friendly, they put an effort to make you feel like part of the family and gather together with them, which is what I enjoy a lot in a hostel atmosphere! One of the crew members celebrated her birthday during my stay, and everyone invited all the guests to take part on the party!  I definitely would like to come back there and enjoy the great vibes of the place!",40,244
"I was happy with my stay here. It was clean, good value, all the dorms have fans and some even have a/c, the WiFi is really good, nice breakfast, good beds, good rooms and very kind and helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again.",20,244
"We stayed in a private room for two nights, enjoyed the hearty breakfasts and found Miguel behind to bar to be super helpful in planning our daily activities. Though the staff (and friends?) tend to hang around in the common area which creates a weird vibe, like you’re interrupting something. But no qualms about the room.",10,244
"Awesome hostel, best in Tulum! Amazing activities organised every day and great clean rooms with privacy curtains. Free breakfast included which was also incredible. My three nights here were not enough. I shall definitely be returning. 5/5",50,245
"This was my first trip outside of Canada in many years and first solo trip. I stayed at two other hostels on my entire vacation. This hands down was the best hostel I've been to so far. The others I stayed at don't even come near the overall experience I got here.  I truly feels like you are part of a family here. There's usually somebody at reception you can chit chat with. Lots of the staff are volunteers. They are involved with the day trips and events themselves. Everything is planned adhoc, so never formal with schedules or transportation. It makes for some adventurous experiences. This all makes for other travellers being more open with talking to other travellers there I believe. The other hostels I went to it was much more difficult to connect with anybody since most",50,245
" where travelling in groups. This one it was more solo travellers or very small groups.  Complaints would be is I think the breakfast is a bit small, looks around 500-600 calories. But, it doesn't seem common to get a free breakfast either at hostels. And the kitchen feels small if you wanted to cook your own food.  It you are staying in Tulum, this is the only place you should be staying at. If you want to check out the other hostels, go there in the day to drink and party. ",50,245

"After renting a penthouse in Playa Del Carmen for a month, I finally came to my senses and took the advice of one of my most respected & favorite travelers (@karlwatson18), who stayed here while visiting Tulum himself (pre-covid times). I decided to make the move and cannot recommend this place more. The staff are enjoyable, warm when you need them to be, and always helpful. As you can imagine, running a hostel during these tumultuous times has got to be one of the most challenging jobs in the travel industry. Still, the crew makes everything enjoyable, safe, and you become instant family at Mama's Home. If you are planning a trip to the Riviera Maya and trying to decide if you should stay in Cancun, Playa, Tulum, Puerto Morelos, or wherever... I can in full volition say that",50,245
" this is where I want to rest my head, meet new people, and spend my time. I skipped their notoriously delicious breakfast every morning and still have the fondest memories of this very special place. I hope you all get the chance to travel and visit soon - stay safe out there!",50,245
…,50,245
"With all that is going on in the world at the moment, I had a chance to reflect on the places I have been. To this day, when I think about my favorite hostel I've ever been to, Mama's Home comes to mind. I have been here twice, once in January 2018 and again in March 2019. The first trip could not have been more perfect. I met amazing people from all around the world, visited beautiful places, hung out at the beach and danced all night. It was so amazing, I decided to come back a year later.   The most recent trip was even more spectacular. The people are always friendly, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is relaxed and exciting. This time around I met a boy that lives 10,000 miles away from me. A year later, we are making plans to live together in the same country.  ",50,245
" This place has a beautiful way of making you feel comfortable while providing you with opportunities to experience the culture of the area. If you are traveling here in the future, stay at Mama's home. You won't regret it.",50,245

A really pleasant stay. We were 2 couples from Ireland and spent 5 nights here for New Years. Christian and his mum were excellent hosts and made us feel so welcome. The home baked Italian cake with breakfast was a real treat! The rooms are very spacious and perfectly clean. All newly decorated and a lovely vibe. Would def recommend howlita for a budget friendly stay in tulum.,50,246
"Howlita is a simple hotel in Tulum, but very cozy, well located (nice to use bikes). The staff is so kind and helpful and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Breakfast is very nice too... I would definitely go back there!",50,246
"Excellent place to stay, feels very quiet and out of the way, but near the city centre. Very friendly, professional and helpful staff. Loved the building style, feels like in the middle of forest. Good sized room, good facilities. ",50,246
"Lovely place to stay, we really enjoyed it. Nice, spacious and clean rooms. Good bed and we had a nice balcony. I am glad we decided to stay for 3 nights instead of 2. Very friendly and helpful staff!  The pool is really nice and clean. Good beds to chill for a few hours (even after checking out).   We enjoyed the breakfast, every day fresh fruit, yoghurt, toast and good coffee!",50,246
"It is a really charming place, perfect for couples. Breakfast is included and really nice. The pool is very beautiful as well and the rooms are very clean and have an AC. The Hotel is very close to the center and you can rent bikes. The staff helps you out with a lot of recommendations! ",50,246
We had a great time at Howlita. We went here on recommendation and we were not disappointed. Our room was nice and clean and the breakfast was great. What we liked most were the people at Howlita. Jesus and Joshua were very friendly and helpful. They took their time to show us around and inform us about Tulum. It felt really personal and it really made us feel welcome. Thanks guys and hope to see you again in the future!  Vishaal and Raveena,50,246
Great stay at Howlita! A friend of mine had stayed there 3 months earlier and recommended. 0 disappointment. We had such a great time by the pool and really enjoy the quietness in the room. Loved all the tiny details in the decoration.,50,246
"What a wonderful stay we had at Howlita Hotel.   We travelled for good three weeks through the Yucatan and Howlita was by far our favourite stay. Warm welcome, very pretty and clean room, friendly staff and a delicious breakfast - what more could you ask for!   Walking distance from the center and restaurants.   PERFECT ",50,246
"The hotel is beautifully decorated. The swimming pool (area) is great. Would have been even more great if there were cold drinks available at the pool bar (bringing your own is also possible ofcourse!). The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's very nice they have a lot of tips to make your stay in Tulum worthwhile (despite of the seaweed problem). The room was very beautiful as well. The mattress isn't very comfortable (you can feel the springs in your back), but you get used to it. Although it was nice to have breakfast included, it was quite boring to get exactly the same every day. Different fruits every day will already be an improvement. The hotel is quite far from the center, but the walk is safe and doable. We're not a huge fan of Tulum, but this nice place made up",50,246
 for a lot!,50,246
I have stayed at Xcanan since 2006. It was the best kept secret with a shaded beach and an amazing staff. Early this year (2021) it was literally taken over by new management. The vibe completely changed from warm and friendly to cold and icy. Blaring music all night long that made the concrete blocks vibrate. The staff from the old management that everyone loved has moved on.,10,247
"I stayed here for a week and was blown away by the entire experience. Fabio and staff were incredibly welcoming and extremely friendly. The location, not only in proximity to the beach, is as good as it gets. Its located close to all the best restaurants and bars. If I had a question or needed help with something (clothes washed, etc.), they made sure it happened. Can't wait to stay here again. See you all soon!",50,247
"First time we stayed at Xcanan was 2016. We were exactly or even more satisfied this time. Its a nice coozy Place with nice rooms. First time we stayed in the bungalow on the beach and this time in the suite one floor up. Both rooms very nice but higher standard in the suite of course. We really love this place. Fabio is so very nice, kind and serviceminded and so is his staf. Allways serving breakfast on the porch at the time we wanted. Also xcanan is very good located with many good restaurants nearby. Good everyday cleaning of the room. Will go back again.   Thanks Fabio!  Mikael and Anna",50,247
"We had such a wonderful time at Playa Xcanan and it was because of two things - Fabio is the most wonderful host we’ve ever encountered anywhere, and the room was wonderful. Quaint and quiet and only steps from the beach. Home made pancakes and fresh fruit and juice and eggs for breakfast every day included in room rate - so good! Make sure to ask Fabio for lunch and dinner suggestions and any other question about what to see and do while you’re there in Tulum - he’s been here for over 20 years and knows the area very well. Thank you, Fabio and team, so much for a wonderful visit!!!  -Christine & Bob",50,247

Fabio the owner was incredible!!!!!! Thank you so much for having me!!! It was home away from home!! U r such a hard worker and ur staff are incredible! The location is unbelievable and the room was incredible! I never leave reviews but it was just such a wonderful experience I had to leave a review! I’ll be seeing u in December x,50,247
"Tulum has grown so much since our last visit and we were a bit overwhelmed by the change. Every store and accommodation trying to be super chic and so eager to charge you for it.  Thank goodness for Fabio who’s been there twenty years and keeping it real. He could have overbuilt the property to squeeze more people in but didn’t. There’s space to breathe and just lay out. The cabana we had was front and center with a spacious porch and postcard view.    The other reviews are spot on when describing Fabio as a Super Host. Always positive, energetic and personally delivering a delicious breakfast. Fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh mango, ..... just see the photo.  Things to consider in June. No AC and even with the beach breeze it’s a sleep on top of sheet experience.  I may just",40,247
" string a hammock on the porch next time.  Check the sargassum seaweed report before booking a flight. It’s along the entire coast. It’s blooming from all the nitrogen US and Brazilian farmers are pumping into our rivers.  While sargassum is a great base to the sea food chain, it’s way too much and is ending up on Yucatan shores.  Fabio says “winter” is best time but that’s also high season.  But if you’re going to Tulum, you couldn’t ask for a better host than Fabio.",50,247
…,50,247
"I have to agree with the other reviewers: yes the site is nice and central along the beach (La Zebra and the Mulberry Project bar close by, and our best meal of the entire trip was a new restaurant Bak Nul right across the street. Had the best octopus anywhere around Tulum, and creative dishes), but the friendly helpful Fabio kicked everything up to another level. Our room was fabulous: 2nd floor overlooking the beach through the palm trees (see attached pic). When we were shown the room, we just stood there with our jaws hanging open. It is NOT a 5 star place; it is relaxed, a bit funky, and you have to time your warm shower wisely, but who wants to stay at a Hilton everywhere you go? Here’s a typical Fabio story: we had to leave for our flight home at 7:30 AM, but the shuttle",50,247
"My boyfriend and I took the tour to Casa a tortuga cenotes from Tulum. Overall friendly service, but really all they do is pay the entrance fee and take you there and back. We had rented a car for the trip so there was really no reason for us to go through iTour but you live and you learn. ALSO upon arrival to Casa Tortuga they will stop by a tequila shop at the entrance next to the other souvenir shops. Whatever you do, don’t be fooled and buy the $250 El Jefe Reserva that they try to push on you! They claim that it is a aged for 10 year Remy Martin barrel but this product is completely fraudulent! Don’t waste your money like we did. BEWARE. The iTour guys must have a deal with them because they stopped there for us to do a tequila tasting. So shady!",20,248
"Stayed here for 1 night on our way to Bacalar. Location is closer to the beach, about 15 mins walk from the Ado bus station. Room was clean, shower was hot. Service was friendly. Amazing breakfast. Good value for money.",40,248
We just arrived at the hotel and Miguel knew out names before we even checked in.  I liked him right away because this never happend before and I travel a lot. I speak spanish and love the latin culture so I really felt like at home. He always ask if everything is okay and helps you out like a tourist guide.  I was so sad that I left after 2 days because I booked another hotel. It was not the same at all. Plus the Itour is kind of at the main street close to the center. At Itour we could use bikes for free wich we could at the other hotel too but we always had to say our room number and sign up for the bike unlike at Itour they had much more confidence same as me with them. I missed Miguel so much that I came back there a couple times just to talk to him. I never write reviews,50,248
 but Miguel deserved one. Couldn‘t do it short because he is just great.  Gracias Miguel Te quiero mucho ,50,248

"I'm So thankful to the staff at this hotel. They were very friendly , helpful and provide great advice. Everyday we returned to a clean room with towels beautifully arranged on the bed , air conditioning and ceiling fan. I had rented a car and the parking is in direct line of sight of the concierge and the staff keeps watchful eye. Every morning there is a light breakfast and coffee available to prepare you for the days adventures. The hotel is located on the Main Street. Directly across the street is a yummy taco stand , a market and next door a Mexican restaurant with live music. They have bikes and lock available for use which makes it super easy to get to the beach and not worry about parking and to explore town. The hotel provides the basics of everything you need. It's",50,248

"We booked the Sian Ka'an Deluxe Tour by boat and it was defineteky worth the money! Our guide Abraham was great! We had a really great day, saw dolphins, alligators and sea turtles. Lunch at Punta Allen was also delicious and well organized. Thanks to the entire itour team and especially Abraham for an unforgettable trip off the beaten path.",40,248
"Playa selva was such a nice, hidden gem in a perfect location around the hustle and bustle of tulum but still nice and quiet. It was walking distance to everything we needed! I searched and searched for a decently priced place in tulum and they are few and far between in the hotel zone, especially for what you’re getting which is why o was so stoked to have stumbled upon Playa Selva. Spacious Bungalows on the beach for a reasonable price that are quiet and have a private beach. You can’t beat it!",50,249
"To attest to how wonderful and helpful the owners and staff are - we originally came to Playa Selva because we were directed here incorrectly by a site where we’d booked a different place. Pepe, the owner, let us park our rental there and did everything he could to help us find the place we’d booked, but after futile hours of searching we gave up and asked if he had any rooms there… thank God he did! He and the staff were responsive, helpful, and kind. The location is perfect - right on the beach on the south end of the main hotel zone, within walking distance of everything you’d want but away from the hubbub, and right on a great stretch of relatively quiet beach - and for that, the value is FANTASTIC relative to other hotels in this area. The cabanas were nice, clean, and",50,249
" comfortable. The drawbacks are things that are ubiquitous in the area and that the hotel has no control over - sometimes unreliable WiFi, and construction in the area. The only thing was that our thatch roof did leak when a storm came through, so be aware of the weather, but - overall a fantastic treasure of a find on Tulum Beach with excellent value. We’ll stay here next time we’re in Tulum.",50,249

"The Playa Selva is a wonderful place to stay Tulum. The bungalows are great and the location is in front of the sea next to the main attractions of the place. In addition, it has a communal kitchen. Considering Tulum's prices are pretty high, this is a wonderful option to save on food. I loved the place, the atmosphere and highly recommend it.",50,249
"The houses are clean and not to close to each other which makes it really nice. there is sand all around the houses and you don´t need shoes to walk around. there is a kitchen for everyone to use with an icebox for every house so you can put your food inside. Mauricio is one of the nicest people we´ve ever met. He is the owner of Playa Selva and with Bebe he can help you with every need. We had such a great time talking to him and his brother. Playa Selva is one of the rare places in Tulum which is not a Beach Club or Club. That´s the problem in Tulum right now: BeachClub next to BeachClub. Loud music until 1 am. it is awful. Tulum was such a quiet and relaxed place 5 years ago and now Playa Selva is almost one of the last places which is just beach, palm trees and no music. A",50,249

"We were in Tulum 12 years ago and have fond memories of our quiet beachfront room, listening to the ocean and birds and walking along the beach. We decided to come back for those reasons but did not realize that Tulum is very different and commercial now.  What a shock it was for us who are in our 60's and were looking for another  relaxing beach experience. Playa Selva to the rescue!  Playa Selva is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Tulum beach. It is located at the quiet southern end of the beach within easy walking distance of the restaurants and nightlife if you like that. The resort is very well maintained by Mauritio and manager Pepe who make you feel very welcome. We stayed in the La Duna room which was very nicely positioned near the beach with clean and comfortable",50,249
" amenities. I loved the communal kitchen where we met other fellow travelers and could do some light meal prep. Loved the vibe, its small size and oceanfront location. The beach is wonderful and we appreciated the comfortable beach beds and quiet location. Please do not hesitate to book Playa Selva if you want to come to Tulum but do not want to be in the middle of the party scene. It is the only place left that we could see that would give you this feeling of what Tulum used to be. Thank you Playa Selva for keeping our memories of Tulum alive.",50,249
"The ultimate property for your Tulum travels. This is my 2nd time staying at Mahayana and it is a true oasis. This is a one of a kind experience especially for the typical bustle of Tulum. Mahayana feels like it's own little universe and dreamy beach escape while being in a prime location. Every little detail from the room decor, to raw wood of the mirrors and the outdoor showers is exceptional. I can't recommend this property enough.",50,250
"We stayed in Casa Bonita! It was an unforgettable trip. Pictures do not accurately capture the magic of Mahayana. I was blown away when we arrived. Chabely was extremely helpful in arranging our airport transport. Miriam was a delight to work with as well. She arranged a private chef, massages and was always available for questions. We felt very welcome and at home. It is a short walk to town but far enough away that you can sleep in peach and quiet. We will absolutely be back!",50,250
Stayed at Zorba for 6 nights What an amazing experience Everyone was very nice and helpful  Food was amazing at the Taco Shack that’s right on the premises If we return to Tulum we would definitely stay there again. The views from the house of the ocean was beautiful,50,250
"We spent a week at Casa de Las Palmas for my wedding, and it was such a magical time. I can't speak more highly of the on-site staff (Miriam in particular) and how accommodating they are. Mahayana is a very special, unique place which allows you to feel secluded while having all of the attractions of Tulum nearby. I highly recommend staying here.",50,250
"As soon as you pass through the gate to Mahayana off the busy hotel zone road, you know you have entered a very special place,  We were fortunate to have rented Casa Gaia which is situated only 50 to 60 steps from the sea and yet it is very private. You would be hard pressed to find a more relaxing and romantic spot.  From the spectacular sunrises to the sound of the waves lulling you to sleep at night, this is an incredible oasis.  The staff are second to none from pre-trip communications with Snow through to the welcome and helpfulness of Chabely & Miriam during our stay.  Although we did not get to know their names, the security, groundskeepers and housekeepers are extremely attentive and friendly.   We highly recommend taking advantage of the breakfast / taco stand on site",50,250
" where Chef Juan prepares delicious breakfasts and probably the best fish tacos we have ever eaten!  All in all, a wonderful stay.  We are already planning our next trip.!",50,250

"Mahayana is a perfect place to stay in Tulum.  We rented three of the five homes:  Casa de las Palmas, Casa Bonita, and Casa Gaia and couldn’t have asked for anything better.  Other family members rented the two remaining houses so we had the entire property for our week long family gathering.  The location of Mahayana is ideal.  We walked everywhere, both by street and beach.   Before our arrival, Snow, Miriam and Chabely were so helpful and responsive in everything, from choosing which houses would be best for our extended family to coordinating the shuttle to/from Cancun airport.  During our stay, Miriam and Chabely were always available to help in anyway.  Upon arrival and departure, the security staff quickly and efficiently handled all our luggage.  We ordered groceries",50,250
" ahead from Riviera Maya Grocery, so our refrigerators were stocked when we arrived after a long day of travel. (We highly recommend this additional service.)    The homes are beautiful, spacious, unique and comfortable and the property is designed with natural vegetation for privacy between houses.

Words cannot express how wonderful Zorba and the entire staff that work at Zorba are. My fiancé and I rented out the entire group of villas for our friends and family to celebrate our wedding. It was INCREDIBLE!! Every villa is STUNNING and so unique. The taco stand serves the most delicious food and drinks (you gotta try the ceviche and fajitas). Juan and Javier were excellent chefs and so kind!!   Miriam and Chabely were so attentive and answered any and all questions promptly. They helped me craft an incredible weekend with unique touches for our group.  Jesus helped us bring soooo many pieces of luggage and groceries and packs of beer to and from the entrance of the villas. He was the kindest soul!   Everyone in our group shared how much they didn’t want to leave. Zorba felt,50,251
 like home. It was the best four days of my life and I will be reliving all the memories in my mind forever.   Thank you to all the staff at Zorba. You are one of a kind. ,50,251

"Our family of four stayed in Villa 1 for four nights and had a fantastic experience. The villa is right on the beach, the architecture is gorgeous, everything feels brand new and the service is phenomenal. The homes are very secure, gated with a security guard patrolling throughout the night, and the water heat and pressure, air conditioning, WiFi and other services are all top notch (better than expected given the eco nature of Tulum). The swimming pool is large and relaxing, and the grounds are beautiful and spread out with more than enough room for everyone (hammocks and chairs at the pool ,chairs and bean bags at the beach, boogie boards and other ocean toys). The taco stand is amazing with great food and drinks and very reasonable prices ($8 margaritas at the beach less",40,251
" than half the price elsewhere). They made off-menu smoothies for my daughters from the fruit sitting in the boxes at the stand that our girls said were the best they ever had.  Tulum does have a major seaweed problem, and your experience will depend on the clean up efforts of the property where you stay. There were some properties on the north end of the beach where the beach was completely covered and the stench was unbearable. The boutique hotels along this strip of beach (far south near the nature preserve) - Be Tulum, Nomad, Casa Malca, Gramercy - all clean the seaweed and the beach is gorgeous for a long way. The first two nights we stayed, Zorba didn't clear the seaweed, but we sent Snow a note (with photo) and she promised to have the seaweed cleared the next morning (which happened). One of the prior posters noted that this coincided with the owners coming to stay that day, but I believe Zorba will clear the seaweed if you ask. Note to Zorba - please just clear it every day without asking :)  It was a fantastic stay. I wouldn't stay anywhere else with a family or group if Zorba were available. As a couple, I would only pick the boutique hotels mentioned above - it's the best part of Tulum and very close to all the action (Hartwood, Arca, Gitano Jungle, etc.) plus all of these hotels have nice restaurants on the beach (La Popular at Nomad, Maresias at Be Tulum, Philosophy at Casa Malca plus others).  You don't need a car, but Zorba has excellent parking (one space per villa) if you have one, and parking is easy in ""town"" in reasonably-priced parking lots near the restaurants.  Thanks for an amazing experience!  Tulum is magical and Zorba is the best place to stay to enjoy it!",10,251
…,50,251
"Zorba is larger than life in it's unparalleled beachside beauty. The property, the pool, outdoor space is absolutely breathtaking. This is the ultimate destination for a girls getaway, family trip or couples trip. It is so spacious and gorgeously designed.   The property is owned by the most incredible family and Chablez is an absolute saint - the host manager - the rooftop is accessible to all guests and the most incredible spot to watch the sunset. I can't recommend this property enough.",40,251
"Our recent stay at Zorba was very nice. We were in town for a wedding and chose to stay at Zorba to accommodate our party which included three generations of guests :)   Our 3bd villa was accommodating and spacious. We appreciated the en suite bathrooms, the long breakfast table, balconies and the overall aesthetic of the home very much. Zorba is located an approximate 8-20 minute walk from “the action” depending on what you’re looking for. The quiet location was wonderful for our family lifestyle and we very much enjoyed the swimming pool as the ocean does bring in plenty of seaweed this time of the year! The on-site restaurant open 9-4pm is a wonderful bonus to Zorba as well. We cooked most meals in the kitchen (thanks Chabely for coordinating our transport and grocery store",50,251

Super service and in first line Mrs. Jana - always with smile, always with tips and information for activities in Tulum and Yucatán, great great, great, ... This is Mango hotel. We lived here 4 days only, but feld like at home from first minute. You don´t want go ahead, because you know - better place wil be not. Speciálně pro Čechy a Slováky - s Janou je supr pokec a navíc se jen tak mimochodem dovíte naprosto zásadní věci pro trip po Yucatánu.",50,252
"My girlfriend and I spent some days in Tulum back in January. The service at Mangos Hotel was awesome. Jana was very attentive and always had great recommendations for restaurants, bars, grocery stores and for pretty much everything about how life in Tulum works. She was really helpful. If I come back to Tulum I’ll definitely be staying with them again.",50,252
"Good location, everything in walking distance. Jana, the host is extremely nice and helpful: she responded to all our questions and concerns immediately! If you visit beautiful Tulum I can only recommend staying there!",50,252
Jana is definitely an amazing being and manager. She hosted us like prince and princess  gave us tips and many super useful hints about how to deal with Tulum ! Very recommended place ! Safe and clean atmosphere ! Very fast responding on social media ! Thank you !,50,252
"We spent 5 days at the mango tulum hotel and it was very amazing. The hotel was close to the mains restaurants and bars of the city. Also close to the beach and the archeological site of tulum. Jana was very attentive and she answered all our requests. She also gave us some very nice adresses. If you go in Tulul, you must to go at mango hotel.",50,252
I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Mango Tulum hotel in town. My room was so clean and comfortable including the bathroom. I found the location to be very convenient and central to everything i needed. I rented a bike from just around the corner and loved riding it around to anywhere i needed to go including the beach area. Mango Tulum is just off of the road to the beach where the bike path starts. It really is a great hotel in a great location with an exceptional value. Jana the manager was always there to help with anything i needed and the housekeeping staff did a great job. I highly recommend this hotel of you are staying in town and i will def be staying there again!,50,252
Really nice owner who helped us a lot with her good tips. The hotel is perfectly situated at the entrance of tulum in a quiet street. Nice jungle patio with pool and not a lot of rooms in the hotel which keeps it intimate!  ,50,252
"We booked for just 1 day and stayed 4 days at Mango Hotel.  Everything was perfect, Jana and the team are very kind, always here to advice you for our trip.  The bedroom are clean and very comfortable.   We will came back !  Thank you again",50,252
"Jana, the manager, is awesome and so helpful- she was able to organize a taxi for a fair price which I really appreciated, plus gave some great recommendations for cenotes. Mango is located really well, right in town, but off the main road so not too loud. The rooms are comfortable and come equipped with aircon and a mini-fridge. The free drinking water is also a nice touch. Although I didn't have time to use the pool it was nice to have it on the property. I would definitely stay again!",50,252
We had a wonderful stay at the Mango Tulum Hotel.  Clean rooms. Great service.  The secluded pool/garden area was very nice.  Quiet part of town and a short walk to restaurants and bars.  Will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Tulum.,50,252
"Hotel very well located in downtown Tulum. Very clean and close to everything. The receptionist, Bety, was just amazing, so helpful with all our needs. Thanks again! : ) Breakfasts are healthy and served fresh. Sunsets on the rooftop are a must!",50,253
"We came many times during our stay in Tulum to use the rooftop pool. There is a 100 pesos minimum consumption charge, which is incredibly reasonable. Also, since a beer is only 50 pesos, that can go a long way. The pool was a perfect temperature and the chairs were comfortable. The waitress was super friendly and hospitable. I would recommend a visit!  ",50,253
"This is a wonderful hotel in a really central location. Betty was so helpful with advice on where to go, hidden cenotes and booking taxis and trips (although options often more expensive than elsewhere but very easy and helpful).  The decor is really nice and the rooftop pool and bar are great. Air con is v good.  This hotel is noisy but I think all in this location would be. It wasn't really a problem for us. Only real negative is we found the shower quality/toilet/water pressure very poor but again not a big issue.   The beach club they are partnered with is amazing - such a nice place and great staff there too.  Thanks for a really great stay in Tulum!",40,253
"ARUMA Hotel staff was amazing!!! In specific Bety(she’s a start) all her recommendations made our trip a lot more fun!! Her advises every morning before to leave the hotel about all the activities and places to visit in Tulum and around were AWESOME. Food and location was amazing as well! The rest of the staff was really helpful and kind as well, Oscar was an amazing guy! ",50,253
"Hotel is great for location in town. Close to all restaurants and popular bars.  The staff are lovely and have us some great recommendations of restaurants, cenotes and the lagoon.

Bit of noise at night ... the party doesn’t start until 1am .. but if that’s what your after this is the perfect spot.  We had no problem getting to sleep on the nights we weren’t out late just a bit of background noise.  Room was very clean although smallish & basic but we were really only there for sleeping so we didn’t need any more space and had comfy beds to sleep on and great aircon to keep us cool.  We had the breakfast a couple of days which was yum & used the rooftop pool one afternoon to cool ourselves down.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.",50,253

Sorry concierge service I got more the feeling Bandito service !!!  First of all just send me a list of different transportations incl prices  I booked 2 nights and changed my travel plans so I booked 1 more night then I get an e mail I should cancel my bookings and re book a total of 3 what is the problem ? Due to Im a genius member at Booking.com I would get a free upgrade and breakfast then they start to say they can NOT guarantee my upgrade   PLEASE then you need to be super clear in writing on Booking.com and more strange was only 2 rooms buisy so,50,253
 why create a problem ? A REAL PROBLEM next door is a night club so my first night no earplugs in the room  very hard to sleep so when I told them next morning - Here earplugs I solved your problem sorry what a strange why to deal with the problem + bad attitude The reception/concierge service didn´t know where there own Beach Club was located for real it becomes ridiculous I told them I will rent a bike a go to the Beach  -Why not tell me you can´t swim the sea is full of seaweed,50,253
"We stayed here for 5 days to explore everything that Tulum has to offer. As all young couples we searched the internet in advance in order to fill our stay with great restaurants and tours. However nothing beats the local advice. Every morning we discussed with the owner (Erwin) and never where we guided wrong. Erwin gave us the best tips, where to eat and where to go! The room is big and cleaned everyday. It is a bit outside of Tulum pueblo but easy to park our car and you can even rent a bike here for 100 pesos. The price quality is perfect here! But especially the staff is worth mentioning, they really go the extra mile for the best experience! Solera is on the top of our hotel list.",50,254
"We loved our stay at Solera Tulum!  Th Hotel is like a little paradise. The atmosphere is cozy, familiar and relaxing. Everything is nicely done and decorated. There are plants everywhere and swimming in the pool feels like swimming in a cenote.  The room was really spacious and so nice. There is even a fridge with water every day.   The breakfast is delicious!   The hotel is located a bit outside, but that’s not a problem at all. With a cab you‘ll need 5minutes and pay 50 pesos. We rented a bike for a day which was amazing! Like this you’re super fast in the city for activities.  We got good advices from the owner where to go and what to do.  Hopefully I‘ll be back one day! Can only recommend staying here!",50,254
Stayed 10 days in the hotel and never had such great hospitality before. Owner and the whole team are incredible. We will definitely come back again. It was so great and we get many support from everybody.   Best grade A+++,50,254
"The owner of the hotel was extremely nice and helpful to recommend different attractions and restaurants in the area. The hotel has great aesthetics, both inside and outside the rooms, and the breakfast was simple but great with made-to-order coffee and fresh fruit. There was a construction site next door but I couldn't hear them working from inside my room so it was no issue. Unfortunately, the way that the hotel is designed, you have to keep the curtains of your sliding glass door (which is the only source of natural light) closed in order to have any privacy. There was also a woman working in the ""office"" in the evenings who played movies in the evenings fairly loud which made it difficult to relax at the pool. Also, our bathroom door, which was a sliding barn door, was",40,254
 broken. It wasn't properly aligned and so it kept sliding back open.,50,254

"I had a truly awful experience at this resort - I would not go back even if someone paid me. Essentially, the hotel management lied to us multiple times - most egregiously about the club next door (which played EDM so loudly the walls shook until well past 3am). The wifi was not functional, and when we wanted to leave early, they agreed and then scammed us. I ended up paying thousands of dollars extra and trying to remove charges from my credit card. It has been awful. I did see some of the bad reviews but there were also some good ones and I figured well, I'm not too picky, it will probably be fine. It was not fine. Please save yourself and avoid this spot!!",10,255
They canceled our reservation and didn't tell us until we were checking in. The hotel uses Booking.com so you can't contact anybody at the hotel until you are there. Good luck trying to get through on the phone or a response via email. Turned out for the best I guess because the hotel is not well kept.,10,255

Monica reassured me to come up until the day before my arrival and that everything was good there after the storm.  On the day of my arrival the money for the hotel was withdrawn from my account and when I arrived at 7pm there was a crazy security guard at the desk that spoke no English.

We did not expect to have to spend close to 1 thousand dollars more because of what Azucar did to us but we were grateful that Kanan hotel helped us out because they felt sorry for us and was well aware of the poor service at Azucar. Kanan even gave us a discount because they knew Azucar was known for terrible service. I still have not received a refund  and was told by Monica the manager that I needed to call my bank to dispute the charge instead of her just giving me a refund!!!!!! This was the worst travel experience with a hotel that I have ever had!!!!! I will never forget this horrible experience and if you don't want this to happen to you do not book here!!!

We booked for a week and were forced to find another hotel costing us HUNDREDS more because the hotel inventory went down and prices went up. 100% would NOT recommend this headache of a place, they clearly don't know how to run a hotel and are not trustworthy. I wouldn't risk ruining a vacation booking here and not knowing if they will change their minds about you staying. (Very bizarre situation)",50,256
"My neice and I stayed for a week, we loved our unit (flat). Martine is an amazing host and very knowledgeable. We loved staying in Tulum and would highly recommend staying here. We did many day trips to the ruins, cenotes and beaches.   Martine is very friendly and has great suggestions. We did a tour with alltournative to Coba.   I would suggest renting a car, but don't purchase insurance outside, purchase it when you pick up your car as they will charge you insurance whether you have it covered through your card or purchased extra through your travel insurance. ",50,256
"We enjoyed our stay at Residence Robinson tremendously. The rooms are very clean, the bed was comfy and the atmosphere is relaxed. It was nice and quiet so no problem getting a good nights sleep. When we had questions the host Martine was super helpful and she offered us the house own bicycles to use free of charge to get around town. We had a wonderful evening with a potluck BBQ with the other guests one night - overall a great place we can recommend to anyone that is looking to have a relaxing holiday with all the comfort and support you can expect while travelling.",50,256
"Although the first room we were placed in was not fully air-conditioned, and had a weird smell coming from the bathroom, once we moved to a different room, everything was so much better. The air conditioning was much cooler, and the room felt cozier. Although the breakfast service was a bit slow, we really enjoyed the Mexican style eggs, as well as the fresh fruit drinks. It was a wonderful way to start each day. The workers are also extremely friendly, and we enjoyed our time with them. A definite highlight was the Terrace where we could sit outside, and enjoy the warm air in a somewhat private matter. The hotel is located in an amazing location. You are within walking distance of everything. There are so many restaurants, as well as a market that is close by. We also rented",40,257

"We got off to a rough start with this hotel upon check in, just in time for bed after a late flight:  -A/C was not working.  Room was humid and hot.  We thought slept terribly the first night. -No hot water for shower. -Smell of sewage in the whole room as we slept, coming from the washroom. -No black out blinds.  The lights on the veranda were automated, the the light shines brightly through the window coverings.  I woke up at 5am thinking it was sunlight.   -The room even seemed 'old' and 'tired' despite this being a newer hotel.  The above-mentioned points made me regret booking this place within hours of checking in.   This took place in Room #8.    Other things that did not help:  the wi-fi stopped working a couple of times, for hours (this means no TV and not internet);",50,257
" lack of storage space for clothing/items; no beach towels to take to the beach; room safe not user-friendly; not the easiest place to find for cab drivers/transfers.    The next day we got our room switched to the ground floor, in Room #4.  Our stay got much better after that.  A/C worked very well; complete black-out blinds were perfect; no smell of sewage.  [although for some reason this room had a regular supply of mosquitoes, even though no window was open - I even got a bite on the hand in the night].    My favourite part of this place was the breakfasts and the room balcony.  We enjoyed the breakfasts enough to go every day for 8 days.  There is not much of a choice (two altogether), but we always enjoyed the Mexican style scrambled eggs.  And I always looked forward to the freshly blended fruit drinks.  The balcony was a great respite after a day of travels.  The ground floor balconies are grown in with tall plants, which I prefer over direct exposure to sun and heat on the upper floor balconies.",50,257

Fraud! We booked online and came to checkin. They gave us a shared bathroom which we refused. The lady asked for 50$ to cancel the reservation (She took the money and cancelled one room).

We were 'greeted' by a member of staff who didn't believe that we had booked, and then quibbled the price we had paid via booking.com. He showed us into a lovely room, asked us if that was suitable for us, and then said we couldn't possibly stay in it because we hadn't paid enough. He then got out the receipts of other customers to show us how much they were paying in comparison to us (pretty sure that's not allowed).   We stuck to our original price and he eventually showed us another room (which was also nice). It was getting late and he decided that we could stay there.

"I spend a day in libelula, it took me back to 2015 when first I introduced to this magical place. This is not your luxury hotel you see in social media but you have what you need, This is the place to be in real.  This is a place you enjoy the nature, meeting great people and real tulum.  I wish i knew about this place before and I would definitely stayed there!  By end of my day i felt i know everyone forever! Last,Food is unreal!",50,259
We came for lunch at this fantastic serene place and to us Tulum should be like this. The food (fish taco’s anf guacemole!!) are yum! Combine it with a beer and you are all set. The setting is lovely and relaxing. One of the best lunches we had in Tulum. We will go back for sure.,50,259
"Libélula Tulum is like the old Tulum from before 2007 or so, which means awesome...pristine, peaceful, rustic, and beautiful, with few people and no neighboring hotels. I went in November 2021 and am going again in November 2022. You can walk on the amazing beach forever to the south and see hardly anyone. I made the mistake of going out to eat in the evening...because I realized too late that Libélula has the most delicious food of the highest quality, so I recommend just chilling out at the hotel the whole time and not dealing with the insanity of the beach road and the loud restaurants. I have a video on YouTube from my visit. Just search for the name of the hotel and my name!",50,259
"First of all, I have no idea where these 4 and 5 star reviews came from. If you are conflicted (as I was) weighing the high star reviews coupled with the beautiful beach photos and stellar treehouse architecture with the fact that “Glamping” is included in the brand name, allow me to clarify: there is minimal to no customer service at this hotel - there are no phones in the rooms. If you want food, ice, a fresh towel or your room cleaned, you have to find a staff member on the property and there’s a 50% chance that you will get what you asked for.

There was one day when we had none, unless you asked for it to be turned on, because allegedly the city supply was shut off, yet, we were at Yaan Spa, earlier that morning, having a beautiful couples bath. If you book this hotel, and I have no idea why you would for the price, you will be disappointed. We paid $834/night to have inconsistent hot water, sand in our sheets, awful customer service and depending on where your room is located — loud footsteps in the morning and night above you, guest blaring music and the best part - guests having sex and your whole room shaking. We had to find the comedy in it. This place is an SNL skit. I kid you not. Its just not worth what they charge and pretend to be. It’s worth $250/night - max. I recommend Papaya Playa Project. That is where we are now. With actual service on the beach. As I write this, we are enjoying margaritas and fresh oysters. There are servers constantly walking back and forth in uniforms, our room has a view of the ocean, there are phones in the room, the beach is equally beautiful, there is hot water and staff is everywhere to be found for $657/night.

"We did tons of research to find a relaxing, simple and elegant place to stay in Tulum this year. Neither of us had been in over 12 years and we had heard that Tulum had grown out of control. We were so fortunate to find Libelula!  Our host, Jorge, was calm, attentive, pleasant and always happy to share whatever information we wanted, be it political or social questions about Tulum/Mexico, or just a good place to eat dinner (though it is hard to beat the food they offer there!). He was the perfect host, in our opinion! The rooms were perfect for us, though be aware that this is elegant simplicity. Don't go there thinking you're getting satellite tv and a jacuzzi in the room. Everything a person truly needs is there and well curated. The staff is very nice and efficient.  The",50,259
" beach and property are both amazing. Nature at its finest. We were there in early December, so there was no seaweed in the water (I think in summer months it can be a problem). I would not call this ""glamping"" as you are in proper cabanas, not any sort of tent or yurt. I would also say that it is pricy, but you are paying for an environment that does not exist in Tulum anymore. All in all, the experience was magical and I hope that Libelula can stay as it is as long as possible...  The airport transfer service that they recommend was very well organised and fairly priced... just keep in mind that it is 1.5 to 2 hours ride to Tulum form the Cancun airport. We were so sad to leave but hope to return soon!",50,259

People! Do yourself a favor and if you are traveling to Tulum book a few days with Libelula. A small and cozy paradise with a great beach and bar. You rarely find such nice hosts and the food was heavenly. We were all happy and will be back! So don't miss it!,50,259
"First, the rooms/suites are very nice. Rooms are nicely furnished and looks fresh and clean. Toilet and shower immaculate. Even looks like designer basins.  Now to the BIG problem. The rooms/suites are located next to a well trafficked road ( feels like a motorway). There are trucks/lorries that starts, stops and accelerate. There are cars, motorcycles and scooters/mopeds that pass. It seems like all or next to all are lacking mufflers/silencer. There are no sound barriers to the road and the road is just 10-15 meters away (like 40 feet). You can even hear people passing as they walk by talking. Staff/Owners mails me (not on the premises) that they never heard this before. That has to be some of a version cause otherwise they’ve just housed hearing impaired guests. On the other",10,260

"We arrived in the early morning from an overnight bus-journey coming from Palenque, but eventhough we were there hours before check in time, our room was being cleaned at that moment and 30min later we were able to move in. We did mention our early arrival in advance, so it was nice that they reserved the room that would be available the earliest.  The additional 5% for payments by credit card is a bit passé, in my opinion.",40,260
"Recently stayed at Maya Pax with two of my close friends. The place is gorgeous and we were very comfortable in our little apartment. The location is good, walking distance from the town center and there is a gas station/ convenience store just a couple of blocks away. Chiara, who is in charge, was very kind and if she wasn't at the reception you could reach her through WhatsApp. Avianca had broken my luggage and I needed to fill out a complaint form, she was nice enough to print it out for me and scan it once I'd filled it out - I really appreciated this & was very grateful for the nice gesture. I definitely recommend Maya Pax & will have great memories of my days there.",30,260
"Stayed 9 nights here in March 2019. This was our 3rd visit to,Tulum so we’ve stayed in other hotels. Everyone was really friendly and the manger very helpful when we needed advice. The rooms were spacious with a king size bed. Cleaned daily. Self catering and just enough equipment but no kettle so we boiled in a pan. Fresh water is provided in each room for free in 20 litre containers with a pump on top. The grounds are well kept. The pool was the best we’ve had in Tulum. Not massive but they aren’t in Tulum. Spent a few days just lazing around by the pool and most of the time there wasn’t any one else around. It’s a hike into town so hiriing a bike is a good idea but it is walkable too. All in all no issues at all (except no kettle)",40,260

Unfortunately we didnt get much sleep as there was a club pumping music every night or dogs barking or road traffic (so bring earplugs). It is quite far out of Tulum (20 minute walk) and at night felt un-safe walking down the dirt track to the main road (especially with our child).   Although the room was lovely, the surroundings didnt really seem like the photo's and there was dog poo on the grass.",10,260
"My husband and I stayed at one of the cabanas for 3 months, and it was wonderful. The property is easy to get to, and it's gated so it is very secure. Pavlina is a wonderful host, and I fell in love with her dog, Negrita. I spoiled Negrita with lots of belly rubs. Corazon de Selva is just a short walk from the main square andthe  main road in Macario, and I took morning walks around the square almost everyday. There are many places to eat nearby as well. The collectivo stop is at the square too. The property has a very large palapa in the middle of the property where there are comfortable hammacks to lie in to just read and enjoy the silence. If you need any help with the area, Pavlina can help you with anything. I highly recommend this property!",50,261
"If you are looking for an awesome, calm and very relaxed place away from busy Tulum, but just the right amount of time to get there, look no more. The location is perfect, colectivo goes from Tulum to Macario Gomez and back every hour for 25 pesos and if you are renting a car its just about 15 minutes or so. The place looks wonderful, its set in the jungle away from the road, its very peaceful and the atmosphere is indescribable. Pavlina is the best host you can wish for, always cheerful and very helpful. She really made us feel like home. The pets are amazing. Photo of Osho the cat attached. Looking forward to visit again as this place is really special.",50,261

The change of air and the confidence and clergies of her massage transported me to total relaxation and renewal. The only thought I had left over in my head during and by the time she finished was how soon I could come back. The treatment was holistic and wholesome, relaxing and restorative with the sounds of the jungle and gentle Indian music playing. The smells and aromas she used by alternating creams and essential oils kept it dynamic and the stretches while releasing the joints and reaching in to articulations always protected your privacy and modesty.

"First, I need to preface this review with the fact that our family is a ""stress test"" for everywhere we go. We have 3 younger, extremely spirited boys (nicknamed The Wolverine Monkeys), and we basically booked the whole hostel for 2 weeks to use as a home base with friends and family who met us in Tulum.   This is the best hostel I've ever stayed in and I travel the world for a living. The accommodations are clean, super cool in style (Lucha Libre, Frida and Tattoo themes!), with every amenity you need.   Clean comfy beds, fluffy towels, good showers, a pool for cooling off, great free breakfast in the mornings and the cheapest bike rentals in town. The hostel is small with only two private double rooms and three bunk rooms, which makes it cozy and helps avoid the party",50,262
" atmosphere of some hostels I have stayed in.   The kitchen is well stocked with basics and is vegetarian only. There is a grill up on the great rooftop lounge for carne y pescado. We're not vegetarian, but we really didn't miss cooking meat, at all. When we craved meat, we went on ""taco walks"" (the torta/taco stand in the AKI Supermercado parking lot is fantastic and CHEAP!). We had a great BBQ on the roof one night!  Alcohol is not allowed to be stored in the kitchen, which is another great feature that prevents a party atmosphere. We kept a cooler in our private room and the staff provided us with ice to keep it cool.   The hostel is at the Coba/Tulum crossroad which makes access to two supermarkets, the beaches, cenotes (Gran Cenote was our favorite, an easy bike ride away at 3km) and the Tulum main drag, super easy.   All of that is enough to make for a perfect place to stay, but the real magic of this place is the amazing staff. Javi and Don Fermi and his family are just beautifully kind and patient and could not have been more helpful. Fantastic suggestions for day trips, advice for avoid the seaweed scourge (FYI, cenotes are the new beaches!! Amazing clear water swimming/snorkeling with turtles, fish, bats, owls and all UNDERGROUND!!!) and genuine caring and assistance. They simply made every problem we had while here disappear. Our vacation was a beautiful success, primarily due to their patience and assistance.   Don Fermi also runs the car rental service next door and has the best prices and services in town.   We just passed Hostal Chalupa in the ADO bus to head for the airport and everyone groaned in sadness. We already miss it, and everyone who works there.   We will be back. We loved Hostal Chalupa.",20,262

"Stayed in a private twin room. It's described as new, but the hostel and room felt pretty run-down, with no charm. The location is convenient to the beach but on the edge of town. The room was a bit stuffy, poorly lit, and the a/c was weak. The staff spoke little to no English. Breakfast was very basic - some bananas, cornflakes, and bread with jam. We like stying in hostels to meet other travelers. But the place was half empty (during peak season) and people seemed to mostly keep to themselves.",30,262
Very Chilled hostel. Family run. Everything is kept clean and tidy. There's a decent kitchen but bear in mind that it's a vegetarian only kitchen. Dorms are really spacious with bathrooms. The bunks are extra wide with decent mattresses and there are lockers in the dorms. Nice pool and roof terrace to mix with other travellers. The only bad thing was no lock on bathroom door.,30,262
"Pros:  - Right off of Carr Cancun - Tulum, which is full of shops and restaurants..lots of options and things to do at night  - Owner was very friendly and had some great suggestions for a tattoo place and even invited us to a private BBQ  - Free parking nearby for our rental - Pretty quiet, for us a pro  Cons:  - Place could use a good cleaning, bathrooms were dirty, room was damp and smelled a bit  - Lack of facilities.. no breakfast, washer/dryer.. just a pool that no one was using",50,262
"There's nothing particularly good or bad about this place, it just kind of coasts into the 'ok' category.  Good points: the room was spacious, had 2 double beds and the pressure of the shower was good. Bad points: the water supply to the taps and toilet didn't work at all for a couple of hours every morning, the pool was just a stagnant pond which I think played a big factor in the mosquito problem that we had! The location is ok if you don't mind a bit of a walk into the town for food etc.  Bonus: you get discounted bike rental from a shop across the road so can easily cycle to the ruins and Grand Cenote which are both worth a visit. ",40,262
"Good hostel and a really fair price. Basic breakfast included but more than enough. Really big double beds to yourself in the dorm rooms. Javi, the manager is really friendly and gives great advice on where to hire bikes, get your washing done, eat some local food and more. Great backpacker hostel atmosphere in a great location. ",50,262
"The place was really clean, staff made sure to leave everything spotless if the guests didn't. We stayed in a room for two with a private bathroom and although it was pretty dark, you can't expect too much from a $30 room in Tulum, as it was $15 each and that's just a bit more than you'd pay for a dorm anywhere. AC was on from 9 pm to 9 am and that seemed enough for us to keep cool during the night. There's no bar upstairs anymore so even though our room was right next to the common area, we could sleep well since the hostel was quiet. Don't expect much from the breakfast: some fruit, bread, butter and jam, coffee and cereal, but just enough to start the day and it's served until 11 am (although by then there isn't so much left). The kitchen is really clean and tidy with",40,262
" everything you might need but they're pretty strict about it being vegetarian, which wasn't a problem for us anyway. They also have a pool in the common area which you can use all day! Unlike previous guests said, we had sheets. The room gets cleaned everyday which is nice but they should really tell you about that, which they didn't. The location is not so amazing since you're quite a few blocks from the town of Tulum and a 30 min walk to the beach, but it's not terrible either. But all in all, great value for money.",50,262
I really enjoyed my stay at Tropicalito. The hotel is located in a great area surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The rooms are very spacious and clean. I highly recommend renting a bike from the shop next door and exploring the surrounding areas. Would stay here again!,50,263
"Fine little hotel right on the hotel strip and beach. Funky vintage design has some charm but some of the basics are just not looked out for. Curtains barely block light from coming in, the AC did not really cool down the room enough, the hot water took about 15 minutes to arrive and was somehow salty. Overall an interesting concept but the hotel basics are somewhat sketchy.",30,263
"Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the penthouse, which was very spacious and had an amazing view of the ocean! The design of the hotel exterior and interior is very cool, modern with a retro twist. Breakfast was included at a restaurant just a block away and was amazing! The staff was very nice and helpful. The location was perfect.... near the action but away from the craziness of the south end of the beach. I would recommend this hotel to adult travelers looking for a really nice, budget hotel.",50,263
"The hotel is really noisy as it is set right next to the main road and next to two restaurants that play really loud music. The hotel does not have the proper infrastructure to block noise, also, rooms have no privacy at all, anyone walking by the hallways can peek into the rooms, so you have to have the curtains closed all day.   It would have been good to know this before arrival, we had to cancel and find a new hotel last minute. It is a lot cheaper than the rest of hotels in the area for a reason.",20,263
"We stumbled upon Tropicalito for the high season (December holidays) and it offered a modern, clean and affordable stay tucked away in Tulum beach. A small spot with only a handful of rooms and immediate proximity to the beach, food and nightlife. Beat the resort crowds and stay closer to the beaches and local Tulum town.   Can get a bit loud at night due to the lively bars and food nearby. Ditch the car and rent bikes for sure! A/C blows cold, friendly service and great views.",50,263

"What a great time we had! Great view, great service, near the beach...  it exceeded my expectations. Congrats to the staff, specially to the manager. I'm definitely repeating. The price is reasonable and the location is as centric as I anyone would expect. Thanks u guys! ",50,263
"Three words for you: GO THERE NOW  This place is amazing. It has just some kind of magic that is undescribable. You have to go there and experience to know what I mean. It goes a category beyond boutique, it's a hand-made experience  Of course nothing would be possible without Eduardo the GM who really made us feel at home in this hidden treasure in Tulum, away from the crowds of Cancun and Playa del Carmen and within the mystical Mayan ruins  Go there before TULUM gets massive crowds.

We stayed for a week and we just couldn't get over the perfection of the flat and of the beautiful surroundings. The kitchen has everything you need, the shower is paradisiac and the terrace gave us the chance to relax in the warm breeze in the evenings. The owner and his family and all the staff at the hotel were amongst the nicest people we could meet - they were helpful, discreet and always smiley. They helped and assisted with any sort of request we had - they really felt like a family towards the end of the holiday.

It was beautiful,well designed, clean, and bright(except the  bathroom). The staff was extremely kind when i voiced my complaints and removed the charge of one nights stay that went unused.    Here were my problems with the spot: 1. Wifi was abysmal. I could log on long enough to find an address but not long enough to book a flight, make a transaction, or even read an article. Its nice they offer netflix, but you cant watch it with wifi that poor 2. Less than 3 minutes of hot water in the shower and crappy water pressure.

No taxi driver has heard of hotel and so they charge inconsistently. 5. There was a family of spiders in my bed.  6. I assumed as a condo rental, nobody would enter the unit. I left out money, my passport, credit cards. They did enter to empty trash but not to clean or replace towels.  7. There is a table that functions as a reception thats only open during the hours of the day youre most likely to be sightseeing. Theres no telephone in the unit.  8. I tried to get an early arrival and they rigidly declined my request. Its clear to me now that the rejection was wholly unnecessary.",50,264

How wrong it proved to be it is just a small beach cabana hotel with typical beach dining area prolific along this coast menu purporting to be Italian is as far removed from Italian cuisine as possible apart from pasta dishes. The lobster tostados was good, the lobster spaghetti was dreadful any Italian restaurant would serve this in a white sauce not a dreadful tomato based one overdone with onions!

We only spent a couple of days here but I could have stopped and put up permanent residence in this place. All of my time was spent lazing on the beach hammocks. With a view of the open sky and endless beach and a great little restaurant at the end of the bay. This was my all time favorite travel experience.,50,265
"First of all I want to say the photos of this place couldn't be more inaccurate, this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. The cabana that we were placed in first looked like a murder took place recently, when we inquired about this with the manager John Pierre, he proceeded to tell us Tulum has a ""Boho vibe"" and offered to move us to a different cabana because apparently they don't refund payments. During the middle of the night in our new cabana we had hotel staff outside our room yelling and making noise..Upon waking up in we were greeted to bed bug bites covering our bodies, cockroaches the size of a mouse exploring our room and a black cat meowing at the door. The manager wasn't in that day and the on site staff was clueless to what bed bug bites were..I do",10,265

The ceviche was awesome and Raymond makes the best margarita I have ever had!  Nothing but freshly squeezed lime juice, agave, etc!",10,265
This is by far the worst hotel in Tulum and it’s not even close. The whole place is a dump. The owners don’t care about this place and it shows. Not a single bartender can make a cocktail. The absolute worst mojito I’ve ever had in my life. I got stomach pain from one sip. The day beds on beach and entire property are trash. And if it couldn’t get any worse they have a deranged untrained wild dog on their property that literally runs up on people on the beach and bites them. I’m not kidding and they don’t care that the dog bites random people. This place should be shut down for good. Go stay literally anywhere else in Tulum.,10,266
"We rented the private cabana right on the beach and it was amazing!  It’s a comfy king size bed with your own private bathroom. The front porch is nice to sit and watch the ocean. It had a roof top deck also for an even more amazing view!   The cabana is a bit rustic and not “air tight” so be aware of the possibility of bugs. The wind was nice and breezy when we were there, so there were none!  The only other thing to take note of is the water in the bathroom. Not sure of how they get water or filter it, but the shower didn’t appear to be 100% fresh, it had some salt in it. But that wasn’t a huge deal to us.  The staff were all very friendly and helpful.

The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable; we slept extremely well, even though the music from the nearby food cart park could be heard until 11pm... after that and during the day it was super quiet and peaceful. If you rent a car there is a parking spot provided, and they also provide bikes for use.",50,267

Next to the pool there is a lounge, many hammocks to relax, and books. The decor is beautiful, such a great place to take amazing photos!

Free bicycles to use. Comfortable king-size beds. Access to a shared mini-fridge if you are in one of the cheaper rooms. The hammocks were very relaxing.   Only slight negatives: The Palmas Central food truck park next door often played loud music until 10 pm, making it hard to read (something that would not have bother us if we had been out at night). The distance to bicycle to the beach was greater than expected, yet fun when not done at midday.",50,267

"excellent rooms and food, but our group was promised three boats with lean bars, and we were told we could have only two. vigorous protests got us the third boat promised. our guide liked long boat trips that did not put us on significant numbers of fish.",30,268
"We only went to Grand Slam for 1 full day of fishing. In one day the whole family combined caught 2 permit, 1 lemon shark, 7 bonefish and 3 jacks. The lodge had clean rooms and 2 king size beds. The fly fishing guides (We had Luis and Jose) new the waters like the back of their hands and could find you bonefish, permit, tarpon and snook. The restruant made great food and the waters Cristobal and Victor were very friendly. Grand Slam Fly Fishing Lodge is a great lodge for fly fishermen of all adges. We would recomend it to anyone who wants to get a grand slam. We had an awesome time at Grand Slam and want to come back again.",50,268
"We spent a week here in August for a combination of fishing and relaxation. Located deep in the Sian Ka’an biosphere this lodge is pretty remote and requires several hours of road and boat travel to get too. However, once there, it offers impressive levels of comfort and facilities and remarkably high quality and varied food options. Meals are taken in the central dining area with a very cool bar and plenty of outdoor seating to gaze out over the Caribbean. Our room was enormous with air con (much needed) comfy beds, cable tv and a veranda with a hammock and day bed. Wifi was available albeit pretty slow and spotty. The General Manager Mike oversees a team of friendly and professional staff and fishing guides and was always available to offer help and advice both before and",50,268
" during our visit. A special mention must go to Christobal whose happy and professional demeanour marked him as a standout amongst the crew. We missed him when he left for a family visit part way through our stay. The fishing was challenging due to a prevailing and strong easterly wind throughout the week, which made fish spotting difficult for my aging eyes on many of the flats. However, our guide Gaspar worked tirelessly to find fish and get is in the right position for the best shots. I confess that my skills often did not do his efforts justice, but nevertheless we caught plenty of Bonefish and my first ever Permit on fly - a true highlight for me. I also dropped 5 other Permit, a huge Tarpon and a good Snook due to my instinctive tendency to “trout strike”, much to Gaspar’s despair and frustration. I’m not sure which of us was more disappointed! August is far from peak season here and apart from a group of Texans on the first couple of days, we had the lodge to ourselves for most of the week. A shame as the Texans were great fun and excellent company. We were sorry when they left. The whole area, and indeed much of the Gulf was also badly affected by great rafts of Sargasso weed at the time we were there. It clogs outboard motors, snags flies and piles up in huge decaying mounds along the shoreline where it emits a pretty unpleasant smell reminiscent of sewage. Apparently this phenomenon has become significantly worse in recent years affecting many tourist centres around the gulf depending on prevailing winds and currents. It’s thought that warmer water and unusual currents from climate change, combined with agricultural run off are the main contributors. It builds up from around May and is usually gone by October, so visiting outside of that period might be advisable if you want guaranteed clean sandy beaches. In conclusion GSFFL is one of the best appointed and comfortable fishing lodges I’ve ever stayed at. It’s very spouse friendly and can arrange many alternative activities for non-fishing partners. The fishing is interesting and varied and done almost exclusively from well laid out and reliable pangas with a poling platform at the back and a large, uncluttered casting deck at the front. I didn’t wade the entire week, although there were plenty of wadable flats throughout the biosphere. Would definitely go again, but probably outside of the sargasso weed season. ",50,268

This is not a 5 star or luxury resort, but its comfortable, clean and everything you need for a low-key fly fishing week.  Good variety and number of bonefish, tarpon and schools of permit.  Guests were catching all of these while we were there.  Lots of fishable saltwater flats all around in the reserve.  Also, lots of bird viewing while you are fishing.

Excellent service and great atmosphere! The pool and common space is beautiful. Units are spacious and have everything you need. We love it here. The cafe is great too. We will definitely be back :) best place to stay in Tulum!,50,271
"Loved the price, loved the apartment. It was big, very affordable and very easy to get to. Beforehand, I was very underwhelmed at another place I was staying which was double the price, smaller, and harder to get to. My only regret is not booking this place from the start of my trip. There is construction in the morning, and the shower handle is a little bit hard to handle but overall I loved the place. The pool is nice, we were the only ones there, they have a cute jungle area too.",50,271
"We had a great time at Aldea. Quiet, clean, with super WiFi for working. The pool area is amazing, full of trees, palapa, hammocks and a jacuzzi inside the pool, there is also a new Coffee Shop on-site with room service. We loved it and we are planning to come back.",40,271
"We stayed for 2 weeks in Tulum and this was the best place. The outdoors are beautiful, the WiFi was excellent, up to 100mbps speeds so it was great for working and streaming. We really enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi, the bbq area and palapas. The new cafeteria is nice, they have good coffee and baguettes.",50,271
This is a nice and cheap hotel. It works with a small manual wheelchair. Everything is just outside. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  There are two large beds in the room and you can easily be 4 in bed me room. ,40,272
"The hotel located in a perfect location in Tulum (small) city. However, if you want to go to the beach you have to take a taxi or rent a bike which is pretty long way to bike to the beach. The room is under standard for me. It's full of dust and cobweb. The bathroom is sort of dirty and very old and no amenities in the room. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so no breakfast served. ",30,272
"We love staying here! The rooms are clean and colorful and close to everything downtown Tulum! We have stayed here two years in a row & love the artwork, the location and the friendly staff! Tv & AC too! Good prices.",50,272
"This is a great place. Clean, comfortable and secure with good rates. AC and WiFi worked great. Location is central, everything you need is closeby. Prices are comparable to what you would pay at any midrange hostel, especially if there's more than one person in the room.",40,272
"The hotel was very much worth the price. We managed to get a room last minute during NYE and we got exactly what we paid for.   The rooms were clean, the wifi decently fast, the beds and pillows comfortable.",40,272
"Highly recommend this place, its good value for money as a traveller. In a perfect location. The room we had was MASSIVE, beds comfy and the aircon was good along with hot shower. Personally we loved 'Antonio' too! On reception he was a lovely guy, very helpful also and understanding of my need to watch a champions league football match stream on his reception computer too the legend! Would stay here again. 2 of our best friends are gettin married in some high end resort in Tulum next year and I've told them to use Chilam balam fir rooms for guests not staying there as we thought it was perfect. I read a review about the noise, this was probably low season as we heard it too and there is always building work everywhere across Mexico during this time. However the mild noise",50,272
 (doing tiling work) didn't start until 8-9am and finished before 4-5pm. I'm sure there won't be any noise outside of low season as that's the time business to work and expand etc. 9/10 we loved it. Thanks again Antonio abs all the best amigo ,30,272

"Nice location nice  clean spacious  Room  decorated with maya pictures friendly stuff.. ..,, Looks nice from outsite very close to restaurants bars shops...and road ....  But  close to bars  it very noisy. At night I try sleep with earplug .. If you book there bring earplug ",20,272
"Stayed here much longer than we planned as really enjoyed the vibe in Tulum. Turned up without having booked a room and got the Coba room for 650MXN a night which we negotiated down for the additional nights. Room was clean and spacious with possibly the biggest flatscreen TV we have ever seen, although we didn’t use it. Only one day where there was no hot water, not sure what the problem was. Room cleaned everyday and the organic shampoo and soap were a lovely bonus. Bed was comfy and no real problems. You can hear the noise from the bar late at night but it is really faint and didn’t bother us. Only thing I was slightly disappointed in is that they don’t offer breakfast, but the bakery over the road does amazing pastries and coffee really cheap so head over there for",40,272
"I came here a few days and enjoyed the restaurant and the beach club. The owner, Omar, and the manager, Fernanda, are beyond excellent.   The decor of this place is so subtle, yet striking and the pool and beach club are just amazing to have food and enjoy the vibes at.  I had no complaints at all. I highly recommend this location - Claudio",50,273
"I greatly enjoyed my stay at Casa Pueblo Tulum. The hotel is impeccably clean, stellar service, delicious food and conveniently located. You get access to the sister hotel on the beach as well so there are many perks to staying with them. I will be back next year!",50,273
"We stayed at Casa Pueblo for a week starting march 6th, we came from Washington DC just before the pandemic. The hotel is modern and minimalistic. Service is top notch, staff really knows the meaning of hospitality, service is prompt and polite. Everyone from the servers to the room attendants to the front desk was superb. Special thanks to the pregnant lady at front desk, sorry I didn't get your name. There are just a couple of issues, namely lack of storage/shelves in the rooms, and the fact that the windows have a lot of sound leakage and there was a construction site across the street. We sleep with earplugs anyway, but just be mindful if you are sensitive to noise. They have a sister property on the beach which is quieter, but also more pricey. We will probably stay at the",50,273
" beach property next time, where the staff was equally great (the servers were amazing).",50,273
…,10,273
"We can’t say enough good things about our stay. After a few days at an all inclusive outside Cancun the Casa Pueblo was just what we needed - serenity. The staff was helpful and kind, especially when were feeling a little under the weather. Norna was the best!  We were tucked in the back so no real street noise but there was a low hum of club music til pretty late.  Food and juices were fab as was access to the beach hotels amenities!  We’ll be back! ",50,273
"I hate leaving bad reviews especially since this hotel came so highly recommended. But the noise level was extremely high. One night they played loud music until 2 am. We switched rooms to avoid the loudness only to be hit with edm music until 6am the next day. We ordered a taxi through the hotel and were told a certain price only to be charged higher by the time we were brought to our destination. The staff is extremely sweet and accommodating and they will help make your stay better. Unfortunately due to the location of the hotel you are faced with constant noice from the bar next door, traffic, and even construction (that starts at 8am) from across the street. Needless to say we got 0 sleep which did not leave us to start our days in a happy mood.",50,273
"I dont typically write reviews but felt compelled to do so after my stay at Casa Pueblo. I had been admiring the hotel from instagram for a few months before I visited and it certainly lived up to the hype. The hotel is gorgeous (a photographer's dream) - super minimal so dont expect anything lavish in the rooms but its everything you need. The staff are all lovely - everyone from the servers at the restaurant, the cleaning ladies and the receptionists upon arrival - Violet and Norna were both so lovely and helped us with anything we needed throughout our entire week duration.  We even met the owner one day which was nice to know he is around and involved. The location is a great spot if you want to be in town and you have access to their beach front hotel as well which was so",50,273
 nice to have as an option.   The hotel can be a bit noisy since you are in  town so if city noise bothers you i would bring ear plugs. The power did go out one morning which was not ideal but again that was a city issue and out of the hotel's control.  I was dying for coffee that morning so they ended up making me a special Mexican version on the stove stop which was so nice!,10,273
…,10,273
"Initially was very happy with this hostel however when we checked in we asked to extend our stay a second night which was approved. They didn't ask for immediate payment so we asked if we could pay our second night the following day. We repeatedly confirmed this as correct and they said 'yes,yes,yes'... not the case. We got back from a day of activities to find our bed stripped, all of our belongings moved around and a string of nasty emails stating we hadn't checked out. They repeatedly blamed us for this mistake even though they had clearly confirmed yes multiple times. They then gave us no option but to leave and pay for a more expensive room. Staff are not helpful and communication is POOR.",30,275
"Really couldn't fault this accommodation, and was probably the best place we stayed (for a good price) throughout the whole of Mexico! The private rooms were exactly what we wanted, with private bathroom, fridge, towels and free water all at a reasonable price.  The staff working there were great, and location was slightly out of the centre but within walking distance of the main strip.   Although the hostel was great, we wouldn't go back to Tulum as there is next to nothing to do, and far nicer places around Mexico to visit! The place has more of an American tourist strip than an authentic Mexican city. The Ruins are also of the least impressive in all of Mexico and beaches can definitely be topped!  Saying that, we loved this hostel, so if you're heading to tulum, stay here!!!!",50,275
"Nicely located, only 3 blocks from the main street, but far enough to not hear crazy loud music all night. This was great! Convenient.   This property is set up like a hostel with about 8-9 private rooms and a small garden.  There was someone on the property all the time, it felt secure, and there was a bottle water refill area. Staff did not speak English, which was ok with us. There was a safe in the room, and of unlike the past reviewer who had been robbed, we used it. I recommend you always do, of course.   The room was nice, however very basic. Bed was small, we asked for extra pillows as they were also small/flat, but they didn't have any. We did not find it comfortable to sleep on, which wasn't great.   The air con worked great, shower had hot water, bathroom door did not",40,275
" close however. The kitchenette was really nice to have, we were able to keep our drinks/waters cold and there was a small one burner stove with some dishes, as well as a fold out table and chairs.   All in all for the price, you get a pretty good value with this place. Oxxo is across the street.   Tip - this is not on/near Tulum beach, you need to take a 130 Peso taxi to get there as it's not close enough to walk to. Beach is closer to the end of town the hostel is on, so no need to walk far down the main road to get a taxi, grab one in front.   We asked to go to ""Ziggys"" on the beach, it's a 400 peso per person minimum, but you get beach front bed and chairs, and a nice tropical drink and food menu, use of washrooms/showers etc. Highly recommend if you want a beach day in lazy comfort, we stayed the whole day. Bring sunscreen!. Beautiful! Tulum Town is closer to there, and we did look around, hotels *average $300 USD a night. If you are on a Budget, stay in Centro where this place is, tons of great restaurants and shops all around there, very fun town.",10,275

"I stayed in Tulum Naa one night, and wanted to stay longer but money was taken from my private room (which was locked) while I went out to take a quick breakfast. That same morning, other guests were missing money too. The owner is extremely manipulative and dishonest. All my other experiences in Mexico were great, but this guys is just so unpleasant - that is why I do not recommend this place.",50,275
"I stayed 3 nights here & had an absolutely comfortable stay. First, my bus from Belize City arrived at 4am so they were able to receive me & check me into my room at that time.  By then, I was in need of sleep so was glad when I saw my room.  It was big, very clean, and the bed was comfortable.  There was also an AC and fan, much needed to cool off from Tulum's heat.  The bathroom, which was nice & clean, also had an overhead fan.  The room has a big space with a refrigerator, a sink, and dishes.  There are fold out chairs & a small folding dining table that you can use.  Then just outside each of the rooms in the open patio, there are chairs & your own hammock to relax in.   The place is about a 15min walk to the ADO bus terminal or a 25-30 pesos taxi ride.  It's in a great",50,275
" location, on a street lined with several restaurants.  Right next door is Azafran, a great place for breakfast / brunch / lunch.  There's also an OXXO convenient store across the street.  It's close to the main street where there are several more restaurants & stalls selling souvenirs, crafts, etc..  There's also a bank at this corner.  This main street is where you can catch the bus to the Tulum Ruins, which is only a 10min ride away.",50,275
…,40,275
"stayed here for four nights and after being out all day adventuring in the heat this was the perfect place to return to. perfect AC, comfy bed, cleaned daily and a chilled little hammock spot right out in front. the crew that works there are really nice. good location near the famous 25 peso vegetarians nightmare street burger. recommended",50,275
"Large rooms looking over a pretty, grassy courtyard right near the center of town. They rent bikes. There are many restaurants and juice bars within walking distance. Bed was comfortable. Some noise from next door restaurant prior 6pm--8pm, but otherwise quiet. Cheaper than staying right on the beach....front dest folks speak good english.",40,276
"I stayed there for a week and could stay there for longer if they wouldn't rase the room price. The hotel located in the best area in town, the rooms r big, with a kitchen well equipped. The stuff that work there is so very nice and helpful and there is a great energies there. I stayed in room 25, which is my favorite room (he has a little balcony to the Main Street), but it can be a little bit noisy in weekend night. There r more quite rooms in the hotel.  The only problem I had was that the cleaning isn't that good (they don't really clean well, but if u tell them exactly what to do, they r ok) For summery- great cheep hotel, good located, good wifi  signal, and great stuff ",40,276
"We stayed here for three nights whilst visiting the sights around Tulum.  It's a really good little hotel, we had a high room which was spacious and clean. We didn't use the kitchen for cooking but it was adequate for budget travelling!  The wifi worked really well inside our room for one day but otherwise we had to use the courtyard which is shaded for most of the morning. Our air conditioning worked great and the bathroom was fine!  We rented bikes for a day which cost 60 pesos as we were guests of the hotel, (80 if not) I would say if you are short maybe rent from elsewhere as the seats only go so low! I did struggle a bit.  No complaints about our stay, nice staff and the coffee and pastries in the morning were great. ",40,276
"The room was dated and the bathroom sink leaked so flooding the bathroom. It's way over priced for what you get.  The lady on reception in the mornings was not helpful at all.  She kept giving incorrect information.  However,  the man on reception in the evening was very polite and knowledgeable. ",30,276
"we had a great stay at Hotel Vera Sol. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The room was awesome for the price we paid. we had 2 room, one with a full kitchen, fridge, microwave and then the bedroom. will deff stay there again!",40,276
"We had a great stay at Hotel Vera Sol! It was very clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and it was close to all amenities and attractions. Bike rentals were an added bonus! Having baked goods, fruit, and coffee was a nice touch in the mornings also. ",50,276
"Everything was really good. We enjoyed our stay! Clean, freindly staff and close everywhere. Good location on the main street. What can I say more, I will for sure come back again to Vera Sol. If You looking for a budget place there is nothing bad I can say about this hotel.",50,276
"We had the pleasure of visiting Vera Sol. Location is perfect, room was spotless, hot showers, bike rentals, great friendly service. We biked to the beach today, twenty minute bike ride was beautiful. Visited the shops and restaurants. No complaints, room was clean, spacious, AC worked great! Safe and quiet. Wish we could stay longer!",50,276
"We were quite happy with Vera Sol, if for no other reason than that it provided super-strong A/C for good value in steamy Tulum. The staff was exceptionally friendly and the room was really big... and kind of a strange mix, where we had a stove and sink but no fridge or utensils. Odd, but unimportant. Half of the lights and the ceiling fans didn't seem to work either, but overall, we were happy to have a frosty cool room and comfortable bed. Very quiet at night, even though it was on the main road.  Obviously, don't stay here if you're looking for beachfront... like most budget hotels in Tulum, this is in Tulum Pueblo, a short taxi ride from the beach, but close to tons of affordable restaurants.",40,276
"We loved our stay at Vera Sol. A budget friendly hotel with a great location in town. Only five minutes taxiride to the beach, or 15 min with bike (that you can rent at the hotel). The rooms were simple but big, and included cable-TV, A-C, fans and a small kitchen with fridge. Don't trust the old rewievs, the new management started in august. Very friendly  and helpfull staff:)",50,276
"Very friendly and chilled vibe. Hopefully they will do more work on the terrace. I stayed in a private room with a friend and the room was spacious but a bit sticky. Possibly because the only small windows could not be opened. Room and enclosed bathroom as well as common areas were spotless clean. The original price was too expensive for room and location, but we could bargain it down forgoing breakfast. What I did not like is that on the last night I asked about our deposit as we would leave town with the first bus in the morning (7 am). They didn't want to give us the money back in the evening, but assured us someone would be up in the morning. Of course nobody was there when we had to leave so we lost our deposit. Looking around and calling for the person in charge is not an",30,277

"When my boyfriend and I’ve got in the hostel, the guy in the reception sad it was included a continental breakfast, but in the next morning that was just 2 slices of bread, hot water. We stayed in the hostel for 2 nights and we had a bus to catch in the end of the 3rd day. We asked if it was possible to let out luggage there and have a shower after the checkout. The manager sad there was cameras in the place and for that reason they need to charge for that even the place was empty. We accept but when we are setting up our things, she said that we should leave. The worst staff ever.  There’s better deals in Tulum. ",40,277
"I think this was the worst breakfast I´ve ever had, 2 slices of bread with jam and butter and bad coffee. The girl who cleans was constantly following me turning off the lights and fan, which I thought not nice since it was super hot and also pretty dark on the dormitory. The key of the front door downstairs was not working properly and once I had to wake up the manager keta to open it, she was rather rude. I think more love would be necessary in this hotel. The positive thing was location, it is in the main avenue, I had a locker in my room and that the fact that it was quiet.",10,277
"After a shaky start (we arrived very late at night and spent the first day in dorms) we found the MayaYoga hostel to be a pleasant, affordable and well located option for overpriced Tulum.  You are opposite the nicest road for food in town.  The family room was really large and just fine for a 4 night stay. The kids loved the bamboo bunk beds. The guys at the hostel did all they could to accommodate our family while we were there.  Tulum is a hard pace to leave.  Enjoy your stay.",50,277
"When we arrived we thought it looks really nice and cool. But after we got the room, we had to tell the guy that we need two towels (2 persons) and the WIFI password. He wasn't helpful and showed us the hostel at all. Than the water missed 2-3 times in the whole hostel, dirty bathroom (full of hair), broken shower head. Also our toilet leaked and everything was full of water. I know this happens sometimes but they called two times the plumber and it wasn't fixed. Anyway on the last day we came home from the beach and our door wasn't closed with the key!!. Than we saw that the plumper was there, our bathroom was dirty like hell from the shoes of the plumber and they didn't care to clean it afterwards. As a hostel manager you cannot send foreign people in a room with cellphones,",50,277
" passport and cash in it without waiting there!!!!!! This time we were lucky but you never know.... We were so upset and angry because we tried to speak with the managerin of the hostel. But she didn't really care and we demand a partial refund of the price. But we ""talked"" about the translator on the phone half an hour and finally they gave us ridiculously 200 pesos back from the 2100 for 3 nights. Also the breakfast were two slices toast, jam and butter. I really cannot recommend the hostel. They don't know how to handle clients, clean rooms and how to lead a hostel!",50,277
…,50,277
Great hostel with friendly staff and quiet mellow vibes. No yoga is offered as mentioned in some of the advertising but there is still space for you to do yoga at your own free will. There is also a natural juice bar and bike rental just below.,10,277

"We really enjoyed our stay in the ContainME Eco Chic Hotel. The containers themselves are really well thought out and comfortable. There is a surprising amount of space for two people w luggage, the air conditioning worked really well, and they were equipped with screens to prevent mosquito invasions! The bathroom was nice too, with an excellent shower! Don’t get too drawn in by the name “chic hotel” though. This is not a hotel and more a simple accomodation. Also, heads up, it is a 15-20min walk to the main strip in Tulum centre and about 25-30min walk from the ADO bus station. It’s about a 45 minute cycle to the Tulum Ruins, and while they do offer a few bicycles to hire (100pesos per day per person), the bikes had very questionable brakes (ie none) and weren’t the sturdiest",40,278
" or most comfortable. There are a number of bike rental places in town and if you want to explore by bike, it might pay to investigate these.

We stayed here for three nights and our dust bin was never emtied. There is only salt water for the shower and the tap altough there a waterbottles provided. When it rains it is very loud because of the metal roof and in our Container #4 it was even leaking. Everthing else was ok and Juan Carlo did the best he could. The hostel is located aprox. 20 min. walk from ADO bus-Station. With a Taxi 30MXP. The best next Restaurant is El Camello.,50,278
"We stayed here in a private room for 5 nights and loved it.  Great a/c, hot water, room is cleaned every day, breakfast included and close to the main street.  Staff are very laid back but also available and helpful.  They also speak English which is a bonus if you want local advice and the breakfast is more substantial than many. The bar is almost open as well with normal price drinks and good music  but is not a party hostel.  Thanks for a great stay. ",50,279
"I did enjoy Tulum as it's a city that'll make most feel at ease and you just want to take your time to just do you. That's for the city this hostel is located at. La Malinche is a creat hostal with the friendliest staff you'll find. All under guiding sight of the man that will make your stay worth your while: Gustavo, man of the hour. Hear hear!",50,279

"Nice pool area and studio was equipped with coffee and water, which was appreciated.  King bed was large and comfortable.  However, getting to the place over the potholed roads was a challenge, especially after rain.  The location is away from the centre, which should have meant it was quiet, but as it backs on to other properties, you will get a lot of noise if others come home at 4 am and decide to have an impromptu party (as happened to us).  Sheets were not big enough for the large bed and had stains (but were clean).  Shower leaked, so the entire bathroom floor got wet after each use.  For the price it was ok, but I might look elsewhere if I ever am in Tulum again (which is unlikely). ",30,280
"For everyone who says they should update this place, they literally were as we stayed there. Electricity was on all day as their are renovating, changed the name/sign to La Diosa, adding hot water heaters and doubling the price.  We stayed here because it was the cheapest place on the beach and we knew what we were getting into. We called it  'glamping' to get the kids in the right mindset. We loved the location and had everything we needed-bed, dry place to keep our stuff, bathrooms and free parking. The restaurant was not open the times they had advertised.  It was great to walk right to the ruins and beach. The staff wasn't around much. They were very friendly at the beach cafe and we traded out towels when we needed to but we had to track someone down to pay and it took over",40,281

He only left me alone once I got my Mexican husband on the phone and he figured out his scam wasn’t going to work.   He put the band on my wrist while I was in the process of asking him if they accept cards, just after I arrived and set my things down.

Can't beat such an ideal location. 24/7 beach access + the archeological ruins and a fun outdoorsy shopping area within walking distance. Staff had varying levels of English (some none at all) but were generally friendly and helpful. Restaurant Coral Azul, attached to the hotel, has really nice, good food, but they close around 8 pm. I wish they stayed open past 8 pm.

We spent 4 days there and went for the basic cabanas that have a private loo, shower and sink (only cold water FYI) with a surprisingly comfortable bed and a minimal fan.  If you’re looking for luxury accommodation, this is not for you. But if you’re looking for a place where you can spend all day on the beach and just use your room to sleep in, this is perfect.  As it is one of the last places on the beach, it’s much less busy than other places, so it’s far away enough not to be bothered by people selling snorkelling trips all day but close enough to walk there in a few minutes if you like. The restaurant is also one of the cheapest on the beach with some",40,281
"We loved Casa Chachalaca.  We were stoked when we got there, because our  accommodation in Tulum last year was super sketchy.  This place is beautiful--extremely clean and everything looks practically brand new.  The people that took care of us were super friendly as well, and helped us arrange a bunch of activities including kiting, paddleboarding, and a cenote.  They also gave us good tips on restaurants and beach clubs.   Loved hanging out in the garden spotting tropical birds--including a Toucan!",50,282
"Place to avoid.  We found hairs in beds, bed covers dirty,  kitchen with really old equipment not to use, broken cups, skretched pan, living room smells of moisture and fungus, shower with cold water!  In reality nothing looks like on pictures they present. We booked for 7 days but after one night we decided to move out. For one stinking night owner charged us over 400 eu. It was penalty for booking cancelation but in fact I never had so terrible accomodation in any place ! I could understand to pay one night but rest it was theft.",10,282
"We had a great stay at Casa Chachalaca.  The rooms were very clean- all construction is new and in good working order.  The hosts are very friendly and accommodating, and were eager to answer questions and give us advice on places to eat and local activities.  The pricing is very reasonable.  Overall, it was a great trip!",50,282
"Just stayed in the apartment with my family and friends. We had really good time at Casa Chachalaca. The place was clean, bed sheets changed every 2-3 days, nicely situated and surrounded by jungle. Good location if you planning trips to Coba and Chitchen Itza. Very quiet, walking distance to centre of the Tulum. Owners are very nice and helpful. They also run 'extreme control' kite surf school, I can recommend puddle boarding and kite boarding adventure as I experienced both.  Staying at Casa Chachalaca we had very relaxing and enjoyable time, met very nice people. If we were going to return to Tulum again this will be the place for the accommodation. I can 100% recommend this place.",50,282
"Really glad I stayed here. Nice apartment, beautiful garden, cool dogs. What more could you wish for?! The bed was supra comfy. Check-in was great despite my fairly late arrival.The owners are super nice and they emphasize being eco-friendly and keeping Tulum clean, which is great!",50,282
"My fiancee and I were passing through Tulum, and I booked the larger of the two rooms at Casa Chachalaca just before we left Cancun. We both really liked this place, and ended up staying a second night. As someone else mentioned, this is a few minutes driving south of the Tulum main strip, and in my estimation a bit far to walkv to the beach. If you have a car, this place is perfect, and if not, you can take advantage of the cheap taxi services offered. We actually preferred staying more in a jungle setting, and the appartment we rented was a lot cheaper if we had booked a room near the beach. If I remember correctly, Casa Chachalaca has two appartments for rent. There is a one bedroom cabana style unit at ground level, and a spacious  two bedroom apartment at the second level.",50,282
" We rented the latter, as it has a balcony, which we liked. The owners/hosts live at the top level, but the rental units are very private. There is a kitchen, as well as a spacious living room area. My gf is a chef, and if we were not just travelling through, we would probably have used the kitchen at least on some nights. We only got to meet Marco, Heather was travelling. Marco was an excellent host, available if we needed advice. The do offer several activities, from kiteboarding classes to eco trips, but we didn't really have time for any of this on this trip. In any case, there was a binder full of  information there, but we did not feel any pressure to book any activities. Lastly, the owners are clearly animal lovers, and have rescued several cats and dogs. We love animals, so for us this was only a plus. If you're not an animal lover, I imagine they'll just stay out of your way. For us, it was nice being greeted by the animals when we came and went. All in all, staying at Casa Chachalaca was a very relaxing and enjoyable experience, and we would like to return on a future visit. I might even decide to do some kiteboard lessons next time! We do recommend this place.",50,282

"Just stayed at this lovely apartment with my brother and his wife. Decor is just right, apartment is both clean and comfortable. You need a car, it's 5 mins drive from Tulum and just a bit to far to regularly walk (and too far to get to beach and local sites), that said you can hire bicycles and local taxis are relatively inexpensive. Seen other reviews and it might be hot in the apartment mid summer, but this time of year it's very comfortable. I enjoyed the dogs and cats, although if your are not a fan they won't bother you are are not intrusive.  Would definitely return. Many thanks to Heather & Marco, I hope more people like myself will enjoy this lovely place and feedback. Thanks, Ben",50,282
"We had a great time during our vacation in Tulum. The owners Marco and Heather were really helpful and super friendly. The apartment was spacious and clean and in a quiet and safe area. The furnishing and decoration was really pretty and we had everything neccessary for cooking and living. During our one week stay, the towels and bed sheets have been changed twice. Even drinking water and toilet paper have been provided.   Marco and Heather lead a dive and surf shop. People, who are interested can book courses. Also they provide information for other trips (to all relevant sights near Tulum).  And we had our own house dogs Windy & Sandy, who take care of us and have been really cute and friendly ;-)   We recommend a car during the stay, as the apartment is not directly near the",50,282
The place was amazingly beautiful and the lodge was clean and well equipped. This is perfect place if you searching for a quiet and relaxed place in the middle of the jungle. And there was a great yoga hut. The hosts were really helpfull and nice.,50,283
"Spacious unique villa in the jungle. We really had a great time there. It was a magical secret place to escape from crowded Tulum. There is a kitchen to do some basic cooking and we had a terrace to relax after a long day. The pool is great to cool down and hang around. The road to the lodge is bumpy and can be muddy after rain, so we were lucky that we rented a big car.  The roof of our villa was leaking which was taken care of the same day as we informed the owner about  this. Would be a great if the kitchen would have better appliances as some of the pans were broken and worn, but it worked. There is no cleaning service though. We stayed for 5 nights and nothing was cleaned, we didn't even get a fresh set of towels. Would be very useful, because it doesn't get dry so quickly",40,283
 in the jungle.  It is a place surrounded by dreamcatchers and positive words. My girlfriend loved it and was taking pictures of every cute corner . Because of the remote location it attracts people who enjoy different forms of meditation. We had people spacing out hugging trees and singing in the middle of the night. ,50,283
"I visited Aqua Viva last year at this time as well.   The warm, welcoming, slightly eccentric vibe here is the reason I will keep coming back.   April offers a slower and more chill pace in Tulum which allows you to get to know the locals.   Giorgio the owner of Aqua Viva and his staff are wonderful at making you feel at home in his gorgeously designed hotel. He has great insight into where the best restaurants (Humo is a MUST and is attached to the hotel and vegan friendly), beaches, and sights to experience.    I prefer to stay in the city opposed to the main beach. Not only does this give you a realer experience it also saves you a bit of cash. I would recommend renting a scooter to get yourself to the beach as this place is about 15 mins from the strip. Cenotes and lagoons",50,284
 are everywhere along the one main road in town so it is easy to navigate your way around.   I was fortunate to be able to stay in a few rooms on different nights which all offer huge beds with high quality linens. The bathrooms are STUNNING in design. All the rooms open to a central pool that is breathtaking and always seems to be the perfect temperature. For anyone looking for an instagram worthy spot this is the place.   No TVs but if you need a TV in a place like this there is something wrong with you.    Enjoy and say hi to Giorgio for me.,10,284

"Loved it here, after a couple of weeks of traveling Mexico & Belize this was a lovely chilled final few days before we flew home. The beds are so comfy!   Booked through Booking.com where the pictures showed a partially open bathroom so we stayed in a standard room the first night and the next morning I said to Jose that we were under the impression we were staying in a different room and straight away he moved us to the room we thought we were staying in for no extra cost.  Lovely pool steps away from your door, lots of cool birds and lizards in the garden. The fire pit & Copal incense was lovely to come back to after going out for dinners. Staff were really friendly & theres some good food places near by. We'll definitely be coming back if we return to Tulum, thanks again",10,284

The location is perfect and the whole team is very helpful Jose the manager will go The extra mile to make you feel comfortable and facilitate your time in Tulum. ,50,284
"I booked this place via booking.com which resulted in a big disappointment. The reviews where quite nice but the horrible service ruined our experience there. We arrived at a closed gate and had to ring a bell to get in (including waiting time). The neighbourhood is also not very nice and you need to walk on a gravel road to get to the high way and then 800 more meters to the bus station of tulum (quite outside the city). I’ve booked the cheapest room which resulted in a chamber where you couldn’t even fit a suitcase with shared bathroom but at cost of over 70 USD per night (incl. Breakfast)! The guy who opened the door gave us then an ‘upgrade’ into a larger and more private room but when we turned on the ventilator dust flew on our bed, besides everything else is clean. The",40,284

The owner Guillaume and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. Service is fantastic! We hit this spot almost every night for sunset. The have a menu with food as well and hooka. A must go to spot for your Tulum visit!,50,285
"This place is an absolute hidden gem!  It is by far the best sunset spot in Tulum with great food, drinks and music.  The owner Guillaume (gee yaam) is a great guy too!   Kind of hidden off the Main Street but easy to find if you just ask someone.   ",50,285

The food is delicious, the atmosphere will absolutely charm you, and the small staff will take care of you like family. (Thank you Flo, Susana, Angelica)  On our first visit, Flo took care of us, and when he noticed me swatting a mosquito he immediately delivered insect repellent to the table without me even asking.  That really showed attention to detail and care for the customer.  Flo is amazing!  Angelica runs the Sky Bar operation, and she took care of us like a friend would.

Ciel Rose is a hip beach cafe/ bar on jungle side of road with rooms in back - we had the treehouse double palapa - large comfortable room in a great location. Flo the manager was so nice and fun. If you want glamour not your place....if funky loft like room in a jungle with cool hippy funky vibe - you will love. We did!,50,285

"I stayed here Sept 18-22nd of September.  I saw the pictures and thought it would be an exceptional place to rent for my bday.  When we arrived we noticed that it's located in rare area, which was ok.  When we entered the Villa, it was beautiful just like the photos, but later on things started to change.  First, our entire stay we didn't have hot water.  Now I paid almost $10,000 and we didn't have hot water.  None of the rooms had hot water.  Secondly, while we were cooking, a huge rat came in the kitchen area then ran back behind one of the stands.  I reached out to the booking agent Delaney and Kristie who looks over the house. Kristie reassured me that they later found the rat, which I didn't believe, and discarded it.  Everyday we complained about the water and nothing was",30,287

"We stayed for 2 nights in a private room above the pool.  The bed was very good but very noisy from the busy street leading to town. We were told there is never hot water for showers, and the breakfast consisted of 1 pancake, half an orange and 1/4 banana and a good cup of coffee. A bit small and basic.  The staff was very friendly but it definitely didn't meet our expectations. We stayed out of town (it's also far from the beach) so we could sleep in a quiet place but I didn't sleep well at all because of the street noise.  I stayed one night in a busy hostel in town and there it was much more quiet....",20,288
"Stayed here for four nights at the end of a 5-month trip through south and central america. Stayed in a double room which was great and had good aircon, and the outdoor area was nice too. A couple of glaring issues though:  It's a good 30 minute walk into town, and a 20 min plus walk to the beach, and is located by a huge main road in a total no-mans land that ends up being the worst of both worlds!  Also (and this isn't advertised anywhere until you've arrived and checked in) alcohol is completely banned on the premises- which is a shame if you're looking forward to a beer by the pool in the evening to cool down. Bizarre and frustrating as it means you have to head into town to have a drink. Why this isn't mentioned anywhere until after you arrive is completely beyond me!  One",20,288
" final thing- on our last evening we got in at 22:15 to find the gates locked & unopenable and no-one at reception. It took about 20 minutes of shouting and banging until we were finally allowed in by non-apologetic staff.  In summary- good facilities, rooms and pool, but bad location, slightly unfriendly atmosphere and bizarre prohibition which means I'm unlikely to recommend!",10,288

"The initial impression was lovely, but that's only on the surface.  The place is filthy, the toilet was broken,  they only allow ac after 8pm, the beds are rock hard, you have to pay to use the sheets & the staff walk around smoking all day. They only take pesos and most of the machines in the area are broken.  Our son became violently I'll after one night and they demanded we pay for all 4 nights of our booking before allowing us to take him to the clinic when though that isn't stated anywhere in their policy or on hostle world, they make up their own rules!",30,288
"It's sad to give this hostel such a bad rating of only two stars (Great place and location, friendly volunteers) but...!  All in all I stayed about five nights, with a break of 1 night because I was kicked out by the system, which works a such: Lobo Inn doesn't care if guests which already stay at the hostel wish to stay longer. All beds are available over internet. I didn't pay early enough because I didn't have 180 Pesos at hand, but only Dollars and a credit card, which both they don't accept. The hostel at the other side of the street was completely booked out that night as well, so I decided to sleep for free at the beach - without wanting to take my heavy 50L backpack down to the sea, also for security reasons. I asked if I could let it in the hostel for the night, which",10,288
" was not allowed by the manager. So I had to ask the hostel just over the street (There, without any problem). Another mayor hassle is the bike policy. Lobo Inn lends free bikes (Which is great), but for guests who leave the bikes are no more available the day they depart, even when check out is at 11am, neither are they available after 0.30am. Also other people complained about this rules. To me the manager isn't easygoing and relaxed.",20,288

The place clearly need to be refreshed. The food menu need to be reviewed - lack of taste. It is better to propose mexican food than trying to cook european dishes.   Besides all of this the people working there were nice. ",20,289

"Having arrived here from an upmarket All Inclusive Riviera Resort, our group of 5 were a little dubious about a stay at the Lucky Traveler Hostel.  However, based on it's super close proximity to the Tulum Ruins (like, across the street!) and the fact that it is advertised as the only All Inclusive Hostel in the World, our booking was quickly secured.  Two days before our arrival we received a message to advise of a name change to the Lucky Traveler PARTY Hostel and they certainly did not disappoint in this regard.    The Team here are fantastic and we could not fault the warm welcome from a beautiful Demigod named Raoul. As we soon found out, the party does not start in Tulum Town until much later than expected, so we certainly made use of the hostel bar facilities, with Eddson",50,289
" ensuring our constant hydration via a steady stream of Pina Coladas while we waited.    The town itself is filled with perfect little eateries and bars, as well as some vibey clubs that stay open past sunrise.  Also, do yourself a favour and get to Batey's to watch funky live bands (like Buena Chaplin) and drink fresh-pressed sugar cane mixed with your choice of booze.  All in all, your time here will be what you make it, and we were fortunate enough to spend time with some awesome locals who took us under wing and made absolutely sure that we got the most out of our evenings!    The walk into town was a little long for my liking, so we opted instead to jump on the colectivos (mini-bus taxis) that drop you in town for MXN20 per person and are way cheaper than the local taxis (which seemed to range from MXN100 to MXN200 depending on how drunk we were.  It was only on our final night that we discovered a fare-sheet which is readily available to anyone making use of the local taxi services.  Although the mozzies are a right pain in the arse, it is impossible NOT to relax here, and the hammocks and comfy chairs in the common area are perfect for chilling and socialising.  We opted out of the All-Inclusive option, but the restaurant offers a decent menu, and the included brekkie was always welcomed after a night out on the tiles.  Yes, we had a couple of cold showers and the humid air soon condensed on our air-conditioned walls and rolled steadily down into our suitcases causing every item of clothing to dampen, but the rooms were a good size and the beds very comfortable.  Everything was super-clean and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here!    The Tulum Ruins are an absolute must-see, and being roped in to an unexpected ""guided boat tour"" ended up being a huge highlight of our stay.  The GUIDED portion of the tour involved the words ""Ruinas. Foto."" followed by the amazing opportunity to swim with turtles and sting rays on the Reef, so it is probably best to keep your expectations low about garnering much factual information from the crew.    If you are heading to Tulum, then this is the place to be!   I should also mention that we all work for an International Tour Company and are a very well-travelled group.  With a few of us being in our 40's, there were also some concerns about our fitting in at this (or any) Hostel.  It turned out that this never came into question and I would return in a heartbeat!

You can get a glimpse of how",10,290
" rude the personal that works and manages the place by checking the answers on this thread of reviews. It’s like this from check in to check out. Record & take photos of everything if you do to stay to cover your behind but also as proof.  They completely forgot who is paying for a service and how to give just good CUSTOMER SERVICE.  One example is at check-in the type of apt. I’m off season with property almost empty they thought putting us in a room with construction literally on same wall as the bedrooms with it even going up to where out patio pool was. The wall was vibrating so we went back down to ask for another one as this isn’t what we paid for or came to deal with early AM until evenings not so we want to be sitting in our patio pool with workers on top of it basically.  The receptionist had to call a manager who came & showed us a couple other places but when we decided on a quite one, we went back to office to get keys. Well the surprise came when the manager told us it would be an additional 1200.00 US dollars for it. We were shocked. Why show us that. We said no & then attitudes started as if we were asking for something out of norm that it’s normal for people on vacation wanting to be woken up at 6am to construction noise & vibrating walls plus not be able to even sit in patio pool. They finally found us one that was a downgrade but we took it.  Mind you this place 2nd bedroom is like a closet with no windows & no privacy just a sliding glass door. It’s really like a bat cave & depressing.  They are very confused thinking they are doing a “favor” instead guests paying for their service here. The management team basically said a lot of not appropriate things talking about angry people being like a plaque & tourist thinking they can just And the manager also refers to the customers as “angry people that are like a plague”. Not realizing we could speak & understand Spanish plus English. Although their English is not good. They talk about guests in Spanish right in front of them not knowing if they understand or not.  Another issue was we went out for day on Sunday & when we came back noticed the trash wasn’t picked up that day which they basically offer no services except trash daily. Can I tell you they asked for pictures to prove trash wasn’t take out to handle properly. We were like what? Who takes pictures of that? Never occurred to us to take photos until told that then we video & took pictures of everything to make sure no extra charges were done or basically to protect ourselves.   Everything extra cost from towels to if you have to much trash & more. If you accidentally drop let’s say a plate the. It breaks they charge a hefty fee for a cheap plate. It’s crazy. Makes you not want to touch anything.  They don’t supply proper amount of paper towels, towels, toilet paper, trash bags & treat you horrible if you ask for more.  When doing anything they truly treat you horrible like your bothering them or making crazy request.  This is what we offer   When making reservation there is nothing to alert you of the construction in area or that the place is not close to the beach or any of the key areas. Please note nice area but heavy construction & without rental car extremely difficult to get around.  The hot water in the shower was never hot. Called and basically was dismissed as deal with it if you don’t like it not our problem.  Swimming pool is only open 8-8.  The restaurant (that is next to the swimming pool) supposed to offer breakfast and other food but was closed. Nothing at all offered. The WiFi is not strong at all at pool or in apt. We could barely use it & the TV never worked because of the WiFi bad connection.  We felt very uncomfortable and not welcoming environment at all so bad that we decided to check out early & was told we couldn’t as the receptionist left which was at 5pm not the hours stated at check-in as open from 8am-9pm along with given on card with WiFi passwords. They tried to tell us we couldn’t check out until 8am the next day. I had to threaten to call the police to be able to check out early plus have someone check our apt with us present as to make sure no charges were charges as at this point no trust in them at all. (We recorded all of it to be safe)  They are very rude and they don’t understand what service is about at all. They talk back to customers and think it’s their right to be disrespectful. Even the manager/part owner was onsite but didn’t try to resolve anything all he did was try to intimidate us on final day we tried to check out early. He even followed us on road after getting our bags into our rental car & getting out. We were like what is he doing or going to do. It was unbelievable   We travel all over the world several times a year with at least 4-5 trips to different parts of Mexico including Tulum prior & NEVER had an issue like this ever! It was complete shock. Don’t even know how they are still in business.  I wish I had taken time to read all the reviews & comments as would of chose different. Poor service terrible customer experience.  Ridiculous attitude and very disrespectful manners. Terrible place, don’t waist your money and time. Sadly it’s a beautiful property but owner & management take all that away.  The worst part is seeing how the employees are terrified of the owner/manager & we learned that employees are fired or leave so it’s like a revolving door.",50,290

"Due to Hurricane Delta, we booked a last minute same day reservation since Cancun was evacuated. This was a wonderful place to weather the storm. My family felt secure and safe through the night. Even though, the owners had their own Hurricane preparations they went out of their way for us, including letting us use their garage to protect the rental car.  This is boutique with six apts.  Very quaint, but modern touches away from the glitzy high rises.  The rooftop terrace has amazing views of the surrounding greenery.  The bottom unit we had was a two bedroom with a 3rd bedroom lock-off. The rooms had A/C.  Tip- Take the paved road down Kukulkán Av from 307 and turn right onto Calle 1.  For some reason, the GPS prefers the dirt roads. Technology has a mind of its own sometimes.  ",50,292
Casa Macarena was the place to make memories and enjoy a beautiful time with my family this month. It is now officially my second home and can not wait to come back - shout out to Memo for all his attentions!   Great,50,292
"When I came into Casa Macarena by a friend's advice I was expecting nothing but the best. And it surpassed my expectations,  it literally felt like home and was the perfect combination of joint areas and privacy. Not to mention the amazing staff in the premises that were just wonderful - specially Guillermo who made me feel at home since day one. He even cooked an amazing stake one day! 10/10 will recommend.",50,292
"Stayed there with my wife on a weekend getaway trip. Well located in downtown Tulum, (walking distance to Aguachiles restaurant) fantastic suites (very spacious), great staff and had free access to Tata Tulum beach club.  They provide bikes to ride to the beach, great experience!  Highly recommended!",50,292
"I visited with a group of 6 friends, we all stayed in the same apartment that had 3 rooms, kitchen and living room which made it amazing. Few places in tulum have that space availability, it made the experience richer... filled with shared laughs and late night talks. Everything was beautiful, they served continental breakfast and offered free shuttle rides to their sister hotel tata at the beach",50,292
I stayed at Casa Macarena for my birthday. It is a really beautiful place. The owners are really attentive to your needs. Nice little nest away from most of crowd in Tulum. The pool was never crowded neither was the roof top. Would visit again. My issues were the Wi-fi that barely worked and the breakfast (not that great in my opinion). Everything else was amazing.,40,292
"My stay at Casa Macarena was magnificent.  From arrival to departure the service/hospitality of this boutique hotel was was unmatched.  It is run by a kind, loving, professional family which I loved because it gave a feel of being in a private villa versus a busy hotel.  I had high standards as a New Yorker traveling solo to Tulum for my birthday and I couldn't have chose a better property!  Arturo and his finally surprised me with a birthday cake, and also were there with a driving service to make sure I made it to the main strip safely.  Overall large size rooms, minimal aesthetically pleasing decor/design, kitchen for small cooking, and large patio for a relaxing evening on the balcony.  Not to mention the chic bath tubs on the balconies!  Instagram worthy.  Thank you Casa",50,292

"This should be a great restaurant but without doubt one of the most comical experiences I've ever had.  They had 1 option for red wine, great if you wanted a glass of vinegar, $5 in the supermarket, $45 here!  But the most incredible moment is when my main course arrived before the starter!  And, the waiter didn't seem to understand the problem!  The pasta starter wasn't bad, when it eventually turned up.  The chicken main was sent back for a second time, and on this occasion because it was rare.  Some people should not be allowed to work in the service industry, the clowns behind this place are a prime example.  Simply amazing experience, which after a lot of initial anger we all finally laughed about, but please just don't go here, you will not regret it.",10,293
"I'm pretty sure Luna Maya has now changed its name to Tulum Bay Hotel. We stayed there recently and were very impressed.   PROS: - Great location! Right on the beach and across the road from restaurants (Mateos is great) and a few stores. - A fantastic ocean lookout and a beautiful, well thought out setting (lots of trees, hammocks, banana lounges etc). - Rooms were clean and well maintained. Lots of nice touches like towel sculptures and a bowl of water to wash your feet in. - Staff were friendly and helpful. - The cabana is good value for money (although be aware it doesn't have a bathroom).  CONS: - There are lots of gaps for the Mosquitos to get through in the cabanas. - There can be loud music at night from the surrounding bars.  I read many of the reviews before arrival",40,293

"Luna Maya was our top pick for our destination wedding. We contacted them about renting the entire hotel for three nights, and set the dates with Marielena, who works the front office. After we decided who would stay in which room, she emailed all of our guests to let them know the reservation/payment procedures. We then proceeded to print our invitations. A few days later our invitations arrived in the mail, and I spent the afternoon preparing them for mailing. That evening, we received an email from Marielena stating that she had spoken with her boss, who told her they couldn't host our wedding after all because it was high season (we were looking at Jan 3, 2013). This after all the previous communications, including the email to our guests requesting their payment for",50,293
" reservations! We quickly communicated the change to our friends and family, and scrambled to find another venue (and reprint invitations and purchase postage stamps!). Not only that but several of our guests who were not planning to stay at Luna Maya had already communicated with nearby hotels to discuss reservations - and now they had to scramble, too.   It wasn't the end of the world, of course, and in the end we were more than thrilled with our final wedding location. Marielena herself was a friendly person. But it was definitely an unpleasant experience that could have been avoided with clearer communication & professionalism on their part.   When we went to Tulum on our honeymoon, we opted to stay at Tita Tulum, which was a stunning place with great service & lower prices (not to mention clearer policies & communication from the get-go).  If you plan to work with them, we recommend you get something more concrete than e-mail in writing, like a contract.",30,293

"It is a very beautiful  place to stay.  The beach is beautiful, the staff was great and very friendly. The rooms were beautiful and clean.  Breakfast was great.  I would definately come back again to stay.  The only problem was a loud band in the restaurant across the street one night, but had nothing to do with the hotel. Es un lugar muy hermoso para quedarse. La playa es preciosa, el personal era genial y muy agradable. Las habitaciones estaban limpias y hermosas. El desayuno era excelente. Sin duda me volver de nuevo a permanecer. El único problema era una ruidosa banda en el restaurante al otro lado de la calle una noche, pero que no tiene nada que ver con el hotel.",50,293
"Somewhere between the rock hard bed, the cockroaches, and the scent of raw sewage coming up through the pipes the romance was lost. The value Is good though so if you like roughing it I'd still reccomend it. However you will starve in this area if you are on a budget so it somewhat negates the value. A dinner of fish shared between 2 people at the restaurant next door will set you back 700 peso ($70). And the continental breakfast is just toast and fruit. They charge 80- 140 peso for something substantial. The beach is beautiful but not very swimable (seaweed), the dive shop down the road was the best thing about the location. Overall it's just not maintained well enough, some of the staff were snobby, and there isn't access to affordable food/entertainment. ",50,293
"El servicio del restaurante agua de mar es excelente y Claudia,Rodrigo y Alain se encargaron de dar un buen servicio. El lugar esta muy como y  limpio, los platillos que nos ofrecieron los recomiendo al 100%   Es un lugar al que regresaría sin duda alguna",50,294

"1. On 29-Sep we booked two rooms on the Tribal Tulum website for a 5 day stay from 08-Nov using the non-refundable rate (NRV). 2. On 29-Sep as the booking referred to two double rooms we asked could one of the double rooms be changed into a twin. Manager Geronimo confirmed that was not possible and if we cancelled the booking we would be charged the full cost of the two room booking. 3. Not a good start but conditions of the NRV booking were clear to us so on 30-Sep we booked a third room for the same period due to the inability to change the previous booking without incurring a significant cost.  4. On 05-Nov at 02.25, when we were in Mexico City, we received an email from Tribal Tulum stating “Please accept our sincere gratitude for choosing Tribal Tulum as your choice of",10,296
" stay.” 5. On 05-Nov at 15.25, 13 hours later, we received an email from Tribal Tulum advising “To comment that the reservation you have with us cannot be confirmed since we do not have availability until after January 14, we can offer you the following options: cancel the reservation without penalty or change the dates of your stay respecting the same rate. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we would greatly appreciate your understanding.” 6. Bearing mind our internal flights from MEX to CUN are already booked for three days time, we asked our hotel manager in Mexico City to contact Geronimo at Tribal Tulum (to avoid any language confusion) and ask what was going on and how could it be possible to cancel a booking made 5 weeks previously at such short notice. After some lengthy discussion with our hotel manager, Geronimo at Tribal Tulum put the phone down on our hotel’s manager. 7. On 06-Nov at 10.19 we received an email from Geronimo at Tribal Tulum stating ‘We need you to answer the email confirming your cancellation please’.  In all our travels we have never been treated so badly by a hotel, or hotel manager. Following Geronimo’s email we replied to confirm that Tribal Tulum had cancelled our reservation to avoid any future ‘confusion’. Clearly Tribal Tulum does not honor reservations made and presumably had over-booked or received a better offer for the three rooms we had booked or for some other reason which we were not told. How on earth can a company, with ethics such as this, hope to stay in business? The way we were treated was disgraceful - your rooms are cancelled, over to you! Our hotel booking cost was over US$4600 !   We look forward to seeing the hotel’s response to these comments and the rating we have given, as we have each and every email tracking this dialogue and can support everything we have said here.  To end this story on a good note following the dialogue with Geronimo at Tribal Tulum we went on the internet and found a hotel approx. 38-km from Tulum at Akumal - TRS Yucatán. We had the best 5-Star holiday ever at a far cheaper price than Tribal Tulum (separate review to follow). We were lucky (in more ways than one) as it was still ‘off-season’ - at peak we may not have been so lucky to find another hotel at a reasonable price.  We did visit Tulum during our stay in the area and realized what a mistake it would have been to go to Tribal Tulum - Yes the beach and sea is lovely, but the road into Tulum is awful (narrow and heavily pot-holed) and it was very difficult to get from the beach to the main strip where the bars/restaurant were as each hotel/bar restricted access from the beach through their individual properties with only a few public access points between the beach and ‘strip’. We paid MXN 200 for day-time (only) car parking in Tulum.  A note of caution to others booking on Tribal Tulum’s website - Please do not be taken in by the seemingly endless discounted half-price rates - in our experience the rates are always discounted and are, in our opinion, well over-priced when compared to what is available nearby, although maybe not in the centre of Tulum.  In conclusion, thank you Geronimo for cancelling our reservation at Tribal Tulum -  we had a great holiday but it was not at your hotel!",50,296

Tulum was just what i desired and needed. Although the hotel is new and up in coming with adding the amenities of a hot tub and a restaurant i felt like it was perfect for a getaway and connecting with nature. you do have access to plenty of shops and restaurants on the strip. our room was on the second floor of the hut, decorated gorgeous with wood sink and windows in every side with a porch, steps away from the beach, which you have access to the beds from the neighbor hotel, also have the availability to order food from them even if you have to pay directly to them ( we did not but in",30,296

The place has no charm or character either - a big box. Also it is a legitimate 40 minute bike ride to the beach and the Aldea zama area has construction and one small convenience store - stay in the beach or in downtown close to shops.

Firstly, I paid the requested USD 400 security deposit a week before my booking. They then confirmed that the transaction had occurred. After I checked out, I contacted them to ask when my despot would be refunded, and was told it would be in my account 7 days after I checked out.

The explanation for how they handled the security deposit was very different to how it was framed when I first made my booking. There is still no confirmation number or transaction record showing my deposit being returned, nor any record of a ""hold"" being released. My main issue with The Highline is that they ignored so many attempts to contact them about what to most customers is a very important thing - credit card security and dealing with hotels who are opaque about how they're handling money outside of the cost of the room itself.

The property is very underwhelming. First double check that you're in the room that you paid for. This happened to us where they changed rooms at the last moment and also some parts of the property seemed to have individual owners and others seem to be operated like a hotel. We learned this after talking to other guests so your experience can be very inconsistent.   The pool area has an insufficient number of chairs for all the guests they have at the property. They have counters next to the pool for food & drink we think but there are big empty spaces in the counters which look like they were going to install a sink or a grill but apparently never got around to it. That really speaks to the property as a whole. Good ideas and incomplete execution. You're also supposed to bring,50,297
 your garbage down to a bin area next to the property which was always overflowing with garbage. The location is difficult to find because of general insufficient signage throughout Aldea Zuma.   I would never stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!,50,297

Pro tip: go out during the day to explore and come back around 5pm to shower and relax.. Wifi goes on at that hour as well. Americans will hate that, but I didn’t mind. I spoke to our hosts and they told us that they like to keep it as real as possible. It’s not a luxury hotel, it’s more like really cute rooms that are in the midst of the jungle with basic amenities. They cleaned our room everyday and I really enjoyed that.

Cabs are cheap anyway so spending the cash for a quick cab ride is affordable. The last day I was there it was cloudy so I did take the bike and it's a quick ride into town if this is what you want to do. Riding to the beach would be a much longer ride.   If you are staying for a long time I'd recommend getting a car and taking some quick day trips. I did so based on a recommendation and am glad I did.  My taxi driver took me to the rental car made sure I was taken care off and off I went for two days.   All in all, if you are looking for some tranquility then this is the place for you.

If a bumpy driveway or a barking neighbor dog are problems, you don't belong in Mexico. It's also clear in the online ad that this spot is basically in the 'suburbs' of Tulum...

"I stayed two nights at tulumbay. The rooms were clean  and staff were friendly. The private beach was quaint and beautiful, but I preferred to walk down to other restaurants with private beaches, which were a little more open and less rocky. This hotel was one of the more affordable places in tulum playa ($56 us per night-which was a promotion), compared to many of the neighboring hotels which range from $125-$500 per night. However the no a/c made sleeping difficult and the fans are not that powerful to make much difference. It is a nice part of town to stay in if you're solo, as it is really the only area in tulum playa that has any sort of night life. I was warned (when booking the hotel) that there would be nightlife across the street, and had prepared accordingly (ear plugs",10,308
" etc), but the clubs/restaurants close by 11:00 on-so for me it was never a problem. On one of the nights the bartender across the street at carazon puro mentioned that they also offer piricate Cabañas with private bathrooms and showed me one of them-they were nice and affordable as well (ciel rose were the names). My suggestion if looking for affordable rooms in tulum playa would be to go spend the day there and you will find something-I spent the precious 3 nights in tulum playa for nearly the same cost-and its always better to be at the beach!

The floor was sandy when we got there and the bed is not as big it seems in the pictures, it's not as long as a standard bed which makes it look wider than it is. When I told the management we couldn't stay there they  charged me for the whole 11 days instead of the  standard 5 day early checkout. I paid for two hotel rooms for my stay in Tulum because we couldn't stay here.",50,308

STAY AWAY FROM IT, Thee are much better hotels on the street for the same price or even less.   1) PASSPORT HOLD HOSTAGE BY THE HOTEL  this was the peak of the experience. Their credit card terminal was not working, I booked on booking and so the payment was already locked up, but they still pretended to be paid in cash (1000€). They told me that I couldn't get my passport back until I paid. I called booking and reported it and then took it back on my own.   2) FAKE PICTURES AND ROOM DESCRIPTION  My room was supposed to be see view but what I actually could see from my tiny and crappy balcony was only the wall of the room in",50,308
" front of me   3) ROOM CLEANING  In 7 days stay they only change my bed sheets on the last day. This is OK if the place is an hostel but given I spent 1000€ it is unacceptable.   4) THE RUDE OWNER  Dear lady I am ashamed that you represent Italy in this way in Mexico. You are rude, dishonest and deserve nothing good given your poor behavior and bad manners. You run a cheap place that looks and feels terrible and think that it is the ny Waldorf Astoria. Never had such poor staying anywhere in the world.",30,308
"When we arrived, the person at the front desk said that they no longer work with booking.com so he had no record of my reservation, then he proceeded to write my information on a blank piece of paper and I was not given a receipt.

We stayed for a few hours, however, we could not bare to sleep here do to the lack of cleanliness, no running water, and loud noises. The staff refused to refund our money and when we asked to speak to the manager we were told that we didn’t have authorization to speak to them.

A swim in the small cenote in the backyard is a highlight.   What a shame that there is the ""It Music Bar"" next door and they play extremely loud music nearly all night long. Even with ear plugs you have the feeling you are in the middle of a discotheque. And of course there is the street noise of party goers and  lots of street traffic, which starts again early in the mornings. If you want to party all night it is okay, but if you would like to sleep at night, I would recommend another hotel.",50,309

But the bunks aren't like normal hostel, every bunk has 3 walls, a queen bed and a black mosquito net good for privacy and ... Well mosquitos. This last trip the mosquitoes weren't nearly as bothersome as the previous year.

After eating, everyday I went right to the beach club directly across from the",50,309

Men and women's bathrooms kept separate and clean. Then I would walk the main strip and find dinner. At night the hostel runs A.C. in the dorm so that's nice. There's also pretty good Wi-Fi, I was able to watch movies and TV shows on my phone/ipad with little connection problem. I think this is a great way to get a full beach relaxation get away feel And its super good budget. Everyone I talked to who works at hostel is super welcoming and helpful and even called me a cab for 3am pickup to go back to Cancun airport (roughly 2000 pesos) but that's when I learned they have overnight security personnel in the lobby after hours so that's nice to know too.",10,309

An amazing outdoor kitchen with a bar and tables in the back.  Laura, who runs reception, was such a wonderful host for us.

The owners are very friendly & really nice & helpful.

There was no running water for showers, the wardrobes were mouldy and there was a very strong smell of mould in the room. Also to our horror there was some kind of a creature on top of the mosquito net. The towels were scruffy and stained and the room itself was extremely scruffy and unhygienic. There were exposed electrical wires (see photo), which were dangerous in a building with a thatched roof.

"The Taqueria La Eufemia has been my favorite lunch place on earth for several years now, and they moved into the old Om property a year or so ago. At first it was just the restaurant/beach club part, then they started renovating the old Om hotel rooms. Still doing renovations as they go along, but now they have I think 10 rooms, many with two beds (always a key point for me, often traveling with friends). They have now also opened a new penthouse unit, high up on a deck above the restaurant, with two separate bedrooms (one up, one down), and a truly amazing view of the beach from its very private deck. I’d love to see the stars from up that high as well, especially on a new moon. The hotel is called Cabanas La Eufemia, not sure why TripAdvisor’s listing is different from that,",50,312
" but I figured I’d just put my review here and hope it gets straightened out later.  My room (#8) had two VERY comfortable beds (nice sheets too!), and frosty cold A/C, available from 8:30 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. The beds also have strong fans inside the mosquito netting, and on many nights, that's really all I needed to sleep comfortably. Other than the new penthouse, the view from the rest of the rooms is mostly of greenery or other walls (requesting an upper unit helps with that a bit), but for the price, it's really hard to beat. Hot breakfast from the menu, and they make GREAT chilaquiles, my favorite breakfast dish in general (try it with scrambled eggs with cheese rather than the traditional fried eggs, it was a nice change). Coffee is good, very hot, and with that slight cinnamon flavor I love in Mexico. Breakfast starts at 8:00, as it does at most places along the beach road. The main beach club/bar doesn’t open until noon, so you have a quiet morning to enjoy the beach.   What else about the rooms? Oh, the bathrooms. My bathroom was very, very small, like an airplane small, but I was there in November 2019, and right after I was leaving they were doing the next phase of renovations, in which they’d tackle the bathrooms. So that room, with a renovated bathroom? Going to be great value for sure. The shower was great, almost as large as the whole rest of the bathroom, lots of hot water and good pressure, rain-shower head, nice eco products in refillable bottles. OH, and they have drinking water that comes through a spigot right in the wall! The big jug is hidden in a cabinet below the sink, and the hose runs up to the spigot in the wall, so you can fill your water bottles and brush your teeth right there over the sink. Excellent! This is something I have recommended to hotels for years, it's insane that so many of them are still giving out little plastic bottles and calling themselves ""eco"", so this might be one of my favorite things about Eufemia.   For those who have concerns about sleeping above/behind such a fun party place as the Eufemia bar/beach club, I will say first that they close by 11:00 at night, and second, that the soundproofing is excellent. First, they have built walls on the property out of sargassum (!), covered in some kind of plaster. They used this material to create a hallway/tunnel of sorts along the side of the property for bar patrons only, so they don't walk through the area where the rooms are. This is great for noise as well as security (the reception kiosk blocks the path to the rooms, also adding to security). And the rooms, since you have a/c and keep the windows closed (I discovered, at the tip of a friend, that keeping the windows closed even when the a/c is off actually keeps the room cooler and somewhat less humid than throwing the windows open, which wouldn't help much anyway as there's not much breeze right around the rooms), the soundproofing is enhanced. Even when I went to bed really early one night, I could barely hear the music from the bar, though it was right next to me.   Cabanas La Eufemia is a great addition to the Tulum beach (which I’ve been visiting since 2005, well before the Instagrammification of the place). It is full of the spirit of “old Tulum”, and the most reasonable prices on the beach side of the road.",10,312

About a ten minute walk to town. The beds are a bit small for two people and the locks don’t seem very safe (would be easy to break into the rooms). If you’re not planning to be in the hotel much it would be ok but if you can afford somewhere else then spend the extra money. On the bright side the staff was friendly and there was a guard outside. ,40,314

Our first night there, we decided this just wasn't what we were looking for so we messaged management asking if  our original room could be available for the next day (even if there was no AC).  The next morning we headed to the beach, awaiting their response and told them all our bags were packed and ready for them to move them if possible.  When we spoke to them they finally confessed that there was no electricty in the room we had booked.

With a bad taste in our mouths we sucked up the late fee, took care of the refund and return of the $5000peso security deposit and left.

We booked via Booking.com and it all seemed to be straightforward. On arrival, we were told a number of conflicting reasons why we could not check in to Quetzal: that the room was still being cleaned after air conditioner unit repairs, that there was a leak in the hit water boiler, that the room would be available after an hour’s wait, that the room would only be available the next day.

" that the apartment would not be available at all!  It turns out that there was some conflict between the owner of the apartment and BP Residences Management. The owner had not enabled repairs on the property, therefore the Management were preventing its rental.  We felt like a pawn in this interaction. We were forced to wait for around 2 – 3 hours to successfully get into an apartment. We were told we would get an upgrade to a different complex – the Anah Tulum apartments and then we were shown into the wrong room (a dirty bedroom and not an apartment). By this point, we were quite upset. We, and our luggage and our shopping were ferried around from one place to another, up to an apartment, down from the apartment and finally back up to the apartment. It was a uncomfortable and unacceptable waste of our afternoon and we were left distressed by the experience. However, the apartment itself was beautiful. Floor to ceiling windows (with blinds), shaded by the trees outside, making the apartment private. A great open plan kitchen and living area (dishwasher but no washing machine). Stylish, contemporary design and good equipment (the non-stick frying pans seemed scratched though). The apartment had 2 large TVs with some Sky channels. The bathroom had a wonderful walk-in shower and is well finished in marble. On the roof, there was a sun terrace, a mini pool and another bathroom. The stairs up to the roof terrace had health and safety issues: a gap between the floor to ceiling glass wall, which a child or a skinny person could slip through. In addition to this, the bannister was in 3 parts – so there were gaps in the railing. I did, in fact slip on the bottom of the stairs, at a place where there was an absence of handrails and a huge, swollen terrible bruise was the result.  We did have an amazing time staying at the apartment, though. Having the little pool upstairs was a great place to cool off at the end of a day. What the apartment could have benefitted from was a set of instructions about how to turn the pool filter on, how the tv remote controls worked (there were 4 in total) and dishwasher instructions.  Also, the place lacked attention to detail. Whilst sat in the mini pool, we could clearly see small chunks of plaster on the glass balcony, left over from hasty construction. Come on BP management – get it sorted. I could see the same mess on multiple windows in the Anah complex. It looks rubbish! Finally, we enjoyed being able to use some of the BP resort facilities but didn’t like the many rules – you can use this bit of the resort - but not this - kind of thing. I have stayed at all-inclusive BP twice before and these were the times before the new, extensive rules. It was much more relaxed. we didn’t like the feeling of not being sure if we were allowed in one place and if we were going to be asked to leave. It’s not good for holiday relaxation. I am glad to report that no one asked us to leave the Sian Khan Beach (which the train took us to). I would have been gutted as the Tulum beach was piled high with sargassum seaweed.  As well as this, not having access to drinks, whilst on the beach, was difficult. We tried to buy some but were met with the worried faces of barmen. They were only allowed to give us ice, apparently. This meant that going to the beach for a day necessitated carrying very heavy bags with food and drink in them. My bag was almost too heavy to carry! I’m sure BP could create some sort of prepaid card scheme, whereby a condo dweller could access 3 drinks a day. It would make such a difference. This hitch made it far more comfortable to spend the day on another beach (Akumel) where we could buy food and drinks easily.  To sum up, our holiday was mostly great – but the check in was terrible - because of communication issues that BP has with condo owners – and with customers. Because of this issue, I would seriously consider whether I would subject us to the experience again. From other reviews, it seems like a game of Russian Roulette. You may get an invalidating experience – or you may get lucky.",40,315

This hostel was clean and well kept.  It is about 3 or 4 blocks off the main drag and therefore pretty quiet.  I stayed in a 3 bunk bed dorm room.  It was comfortable.  Other guests were considerate.  Plenty of places to sit and relax.  Free Breakfast. Free coffee. Free Wifi which worked well.  Plenty of hot water.  I liked the place.  Big kitchen for your use if you want to cook. Restaurants nearby.,40,316
"This hostel has alot of potential - its a very nice building with a large, well equipt kitchen, sofa area and nice terrace. However it was extremely quiet and taking a closer look it definitely needed abit of painting and life putting back into it. On the roof there was a pool without water, and the toilet and shower facilities up there were pretty poor - this left only 1 bathroom on the main floor where there was a 10 bed, 2 6 bed, and an 8 bed dorm. Lucky it was quiet really!  Breakfast was very basic - we got toast and jam despite the woman saying there'd be eggs available when we checked in. I would also recommend paying extra for A/C as the fans didnt really do anything.",30,316
"I moved to Hostel Charly's from another place in Tulum, to get away from the noise, and was very impressed with this place.  It's about 5 blocks off the main drag, in a quiet neighbourhood, a BIG place with high ceilings, 3 bathrooms (one on each floor), a quiet rooftop area with a pool that has no water in it (hmmmm...), friendly staff, and a great backpacker crowd.  I booked online for the 10-bed dorm, and when I checked in, it was full, so for the same rate, I got a bed in the 6-bed dorm, with a cool and interesting group of backpackers from all over.  On my 1st night, there was an impromptu concert on the main floor by a band from Mexico City, which was fantastic, and very unexpected. This really endeared Charly's to me, a first in all my travels to have a live band perform",40,316
" AT the hostel.  Wifi was good, bikes were available for use (free), breakfast was hearty, staff were helpful and friendly, common areas were available to hang out, both indoors and outdoors.  Met some really cool travellers here, will totally go back next time I'm in Tulum. REALLY liked being a few blocks away from the tourists on the main drag, in a quiet, hip hostel.",50,316

The hostel is a bit away from the Main Street. Therefore it's very quiet there. They have a nice terrace and kitchen. They cooked me a good breakfast. If you rent somewhere a bicycle you can store it also inside. It was also a clean place.,20,316
"We had a nice air-conditioning room with breakfast included.  The only bad note is that for the whole hostel,  around 30 beds,  there were only 2 bathrooms,  which is ridiculous! And they only cleaned them once a day!  There is a nice common area and a huge,  well-equipped kitchen. ",50,316
"I booked a bed in a girl's dorm for 3 nights and ended up staying only 1 as I didn't like this place one bit. The dorms are tiny with barely any space between the beds to move around or put your luggage.  Guys were staying in my dorm even though I specifically asked if it was a female only dorm.  Only one bathroom for all the guests in the house, no need to say it just wasn't clean (how could it with this many people using it). This is the typical kind of place where owners are there to make money rather than making sure their guests are having a good stay. 200 pesos a night for this place is waaaaay overpriced, there are a lot of places in Tulum that are better and cheaper, much cheaper! On the positive side as it's not all bad : towels are provided, internet is good but only",40,316
" in living room. Common space is huge (which is weird compared to dorm size), kitchen is home kitchen rather than a hostel kitchen.  Maybe I should have slept in the living room for more comfort but there were about 3 teenagers sleeping there on the sofa and floor, weird. ",50,316

"A very small hotel for people who appreciate the quiet! It is at the end side of Tulum and easy to find. The rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is exactly as advertised in the pictures. There is no front desk but the owner in advance send you a welcome email and keeps in touch with you by message so someone can receive you. I like that its very private and away from all the noise from dowtown Tulum. If you are looking for privacy, peace and quiet this is for you. I would go there again. ",50,317
"Vacationed from Feb 16-23, 2018 – We usually do the all inclusive thing, this year we needed to try something else.  I don’t know if I want to share this gem with everyone!  We arrived at Casa del mar Tulum and Luis the owner was waiting for us.  The place is not easy to find as there is no sign outside but Google map brings you right there He showed us to our room and explained how everything worked.  Explained that there was a small convenience store around the corner with eggs, milk, water, basic things.  A small hotel of 4 rooms, we had the room with a kitchenette which was great for our breakfast.  The hotel will be 1 year old in December and is located at about 5-6 km from the beach, we had rented bikes for the week from Ola Bike Rental who delivered the bikes to our door…",50,317
Wir waren für 1 Woche im Esencial in Tulum  untergekommen und hatten eine super Zeit!  Anreise Wir kamen gegen Nachmittag am ADO Busbahnhof an und fuhren mit dem Taxi zum Hotel. Wir wurden bereits von der Rezeption erwartet und hatten ein Garten Doppelzimmer ohne Terrasse.  Das Zimmer Ausreichend groß mit Kühlschrank und funktionierender Klimaanlage sowie einem bequemen Bett. Das Bad war angrenzend an den Raum mit einer Dusche mit gutem Wasserdruck. Generell war das Zimmer sehr schön eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Der Wasserhahn könnte man aufgrund der Optik ausgetauscht werden.  Der Bungalow war aufgrund des Daches sehr hellhörig.   Das Restaurant Es existiert derzeit kein Restaurant mehr in der Anlage. Das Frühstück wird in einem angrenzenden Restaurant auf der anderen Straßen,40,318
 Seite eingenommen. War gut und man konnte aus verschiedenen Angeboten wählen. Am Strand kann man sich an den benachbarten Hotels mittags einen Snack bestellen. Somit ist man auch am relaxten am Strand versorgt  Sonstiges  ein Supermarkt befindet sich 5 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Gerade Wasser und Snacks können gut im Kühlschrank gelagert werden.  Das Hotel verleiht keine Fahrräder. Wir hatten uns diese bei Ola Bikes bestellt (liefern mit Aufpreis auch zum Hotel). Mit dem Fahrrad haben wir die Gegend erkundet und sind auch ohne Probleme zur Tempelanlage gefahren.  Wir waren zufrieden und würden das Hotel für einen Strand Aufenthalt empfehlen. ,50,318

"To be 100% honest we did not book at Esencial.  We booked at another location that over booked us.  They bumped us to Esencial.  We are so glad they did!  It was breath taking.  We had a hut right on the beach.  The room was large enough for our family of 4.  Though we didn’t get to see much of Tulum being there for a wedding, we loved it there. Staff were super friendly and helpful. We would book here again.  The only thing I could recommend is maybe having a broom in the rooms to help with keeping the sand level down. We will book here again!  Loved Esencial!",50,318
"I would have given 5 stars if we didn’t have a little issue with our booking charges. Esencial Tulum resolved the issue, just a bit frustrating in the beginning of our stay . However this place is absolutely amazing . Great location, very quiet and peaceful. Breakfast included was a big plus for us . I definitely would recommend this place if you are planning on visiting this magical place. I fall more in love with Tulum each time I visit ",10,318

They were very professional in pulling off this fraud as they did several things to try an ensure they keep the fraudulent money.,10,321
"In all my travels over the years I’ve never had a bad experience at a hotel or resort. This hotel was very different. From jack hammers and construction starting at 6am every day right next to our villa to constant powers outages during our entire stay. Due to being a beach villa, the fan was the only means of temperature control in the room. When the power was out discomfort was high and a scared infant below us was terrified judging by the cries. This resort was stated to be 17+ years old adults only on Expedia and this was clearly not the case as we were asked to keep our evening(9pm) chatter to a minimum due to a child staying below us. Management and ownership did nothing to rectify these issues when discussed and I ended up checking out early.",10,321
"My ocean-view room at Agua Eco Design was slightly overpriced (most beach hotels in Tulum are...), but I had a relaxing, enjoyable stay nonetheless. I was on the 2nd floor of a casita, and it was flooded with ocean breezes and natural light. (Guests on the 2nd floor must climb about 20 steps and they are VERY steep.) The thatch roof, ceiling fan, and mosquito net all contributed to the laid-back, beachy vibe.  I kept the windows open because the breeze was so lovely - my favorite part!    The king bed was cozy, and I didn't have any issues with cleanliness; perhaps other travelers thought the natural discoloration of the concrete sink and floors were stains?? Some items like the faucet appeared to have some discoloration due to humidity, but this is to be expected in humid",30,321

" right in the middle of the main restaurant and shopping strip in Tulum. (So I heard music from a noise restaurant about 200 meters down the street, but no noisy bars next to the hostel. That is a small town...) Surprisingly, in Tulum, this strip does not close up at 8 pm! It was alive until 11, so you can stroll, shop, have a coffee or a drink, and eat out. The environment looked very safe.  The first floor doubles as an ice-cream (one of two on the strip), fresh juice shop and cafe (they do not have full-scale restaurant). They have a cute little garden area with tables. So you can sit, have a coffee and observe a sunset. Coffee and ice-cream were very good.  Unfortunately not sunrise... it opens later. There is no 24/7 attendance (you get a key from the outer door), so I would give it 4 stars for that. Otherwise, very cool place. Tulum is generally a cool place (the coolest I saw in Yucatan), and there are probably many similar hotels around. (Again, probably for transients, like me, because most people go to beach resorts to the east of the town. Beaches are very close, and the town is full of hipsters, which most probably come shopping and eating out to Tulum downtown.)

"Herman and Fabie welcomed us for ten days on our trip; they were friendly and welcoming (they turned out all the lights on the entire property for us one night so we could enjoy some incredible star gazing), despite the fact that our knowledge of Spanish was weak. The eco-villa is clean and very comfortable. If you're the kind of traveller who likes to get away from touristy crowds (we are), then you might be happy here.   On site, there is a pool to cool off in, if you wish, as well as a 2km walking trail. Herman is a wonderful gardener and the grounds are beautiful. Being a nature resort, there were a few bugs, but not as many as at home in the summer. There are also birds, geckos and bats to enjoy.  Unfortunately this little place is situated right next to a major road, and",40,329
The hostel is really noisy because of the main road just in front. And the cleaning lady don't just change sheets but also search in the closet to steals things. The restaurant is good and the pool also but this problem ruined my stays in this hostel. You can't trust people here.,10,330
"This hotel is a nice place in an affordable place and convenient location, my advice is; do not pay the extra for the breakfast, it just includes fruit. Save some money and use it to take a real breakfast in the near Tulum city.",30,330

"Stayed here for my trip to Tulum. First off, not a private pool. The 2 pools are small and public, yet beautiful. The building has multiple condos within it. There is a guard on the premises all night. Bikes are available if you wish to bike up the street to the supermarket. There many several stores and bars nearby. The main strip with bars and beach access is about 10 min away. The place was kinda noisy a couple nights due to people partying with loud music but overall, I enjoyed my stay. The place was very clean, beds are on the hard side. Wi-Fi is spotty. I would recommend though.",50,332

"That was THE WORST hotel we've stayed in - and we have travelled all around Yucatan peninsula. I don't even know where to start - our room didn't have enough water pressure to take a shower. We let the reception know about this and NOTHING WAS DONE. The second night we complained about shower again as we all wanted to take a shower and wash our hair after a long day of swimming in the sea! And not only water was the problem, we had no electricity at all! Imagine being in total darkness from 7.30pm. The main problem we've had with this hotel is that nobody warned us about shower and we had paid a full price at arrival!  We complained to the manager, who offered us an additional night - very useful since we're returning to Europe! The rooms are without the fridge (and TV, bit we",10,333

Ugh. A cute hotel spolied by staff hanging at the desk from 6:30am daily means you are up when they are. Repeated requests to the same staff did not change their behaviour.   The hotel had no internet during our multiday stay.  Hip straw and stick walls mean mosquitos.   ,50,333

"This is a economy hotel, and it is all what you need. If you are in this area you will not need a fancy all-inclusive hotel with luxuries that won't be used as you will be outside enjoying. The rooms are basic but kept tidy, no AC or TV but no need for these things anyway. An hotel to experience the contact with the nature, you can see birds, racoons, squirrels as it is in the middle of the jungle and have its own access to a cenote. Across the street the beach is paradisiac, access is through another hotel and as are the last hotels in the area, the beach is all but crowded, lonely and beautiful to experience a good rest. If you want to experience an eco-touristic environment and disappear of the radar to get a good rest this is a hotel to consider. This is not the hotel for",50,336

"Usually, when I am travelling, I tend to book boutique hotels, or more well-maintained four-star hotels. However, this booking was made because I wanted a low-key more eco-resort type of stay. If you are looking for a high-end, all-inclusive resort like stay, this is not the place to be. All the hotels along this strip are eco-based hotels, Nomande Tulum would be the luxe option along the strip, but this hotel, in particular, is quite a good option for those would like to have salt-showers, an open-kitchen for everyone to access (which means, if you rented a car, you can buy some food at the market and prepare it yourself in the evening), and also have access to the beach across the street at the Rosa de Viento Hotel. I chose this hotel, in particular, because it offered a",10,336
" Pet-Friendly stay for an additional 150 pesos a night. We stayed here for the week, with my 5 lb little puppy, and two other friends, and it provided all the basic needs we wanted. We even walked down the strip along the beach and spent the day at the beach at Nomade Tulum, and met some friendly guests there. Be warned, the breakfast at this hotel is really minimal, and only offers orange juice, cereal (chocolate pebbles and corn flakes), and coffee. If you would like something more substantial, Nomade Tulum offers a $20 USD all you can eat buffet that is pretty well-rounded. We also rented a car, so that we can get to the cenotes and scuba diving, but also to drive from Cancun airport, and the ruins. If you are not a great sleeper, I would bring a pair of earplugs, as the rooms are open-air and there is minimal to no insulation, and depending on which room you get, some of the rooms do not even have glass windows. Room 4 has glass windows, and Room 7 does not, but the air circulation is much better in Room 7. There are other options within the 8 options, but after we had a room change, Room 7 was much better. There is no Air Conditioning, and the electricity is low-key. If you are more high-maintenance this place is not for you.",40,336

"we stayed just about a month ago, it was quiet an experience, a bit far and hard find, grounds in general are pretty nice and the rooms are fine, except when it rains, and sisnce it rained all night we experienced few problems, bathroom had leaks all over the ceiling which mean our bathroom was always wet.. not too big of a deal. But 4am we had to get out of the bed because we had water coming in from the ceiling, not the best way to wake up... i would have thought that for the amount of money we payed we would at least have room without leaks ... somewhat dissapointed",40,336
I can not say I hate it because we had fun but it was quite an adventure. The pictures look much better that what is looks in real life so that is why we booked it. The first night we were we sweated like crazy with no AC and no fan.  I could not sleep and like at 3:00 am I open my eyes and say a scorpion outside the net ( black and the size of  half my hand). Next night I saw another one. They always are in pairs.  They changed our nets next day and offered us a fans for a better night sleep.  Hortensia who is in the kitchen and makes the rooms is very nice and helpful. The good part is that we only used it for sleeping and the hotel Rosa del Viento where you can go to the beach has great food and a beautiful beach. The cenote needs some cleanup and maintenance but it has,20,336

"Ever since I started coming to Tulum years ago, this has been the only place I would stay. Tulum has been changing, for better or for worse, Marta and Gianluca have been building up their place, and still remain to have the same hospitality, clean and lovely home, and most importantly, keeping the spirit of Tulum the way it always has been, behind the private entrance into the jungle, just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Tulum center it has become.   It may be tempting to stay in Tulum city for cheaper prices, but nothing can compare to being by the strip, especially when you can have it all; the jungle, the beach, and the old and the new Tulum at Villa Feronia.

"We stayed as a family of 4 (including a 4 year old and baby) at Condo Hotel Romaya and it could not have been a better place from which to explore Tulum. It was amazingly good value and we got better rates by contacting Diego directly than booking through a travel website.  From first contact and throughout our stay Diego was friendly, helpful and couldn’t do enough to help us. His English is great. He was brilliant with the kids too and whenever he saw us go in the pool he made sure to come and turn on the waterfall feature which the kids loved. He also waited up late to show us our apartment after our late and delayed flight and advised us about day trips.  The accommodation was beautiful - really authentic in style, clean and well appointed. It was easy to cook for ourselves",50,352
 when we wanted and there were swimming towels as well as bath towels. The housekeeping service was excellent and they even worked around our children's naps. The air conditioning units in the bedrooms were great and drinking water was provided. The balconies and garden had hammocks and outside seating and meant there was always somewhere to enjoy the view/sounds if Mexico. The dawn chorus is worth getting up for to enjoy from a hammock on the balcony! There can be some noise from the surrounding streets in the night but that would be the same anywhere downtown and it didn’t disturb us.  The garden surrounding the pool is exquisite and it felt like a real tranquil oasis in the midst of busy Tulum. We really felt like we stumbled upon a bit of paradise. The swimming pool is lovely and so welcome after a hot day exploring the area.  It’s an easy walk into the town centre - especially through the sports ground which is lovely in the evening and also easy to get taxis for further destinations. There are local fruit sellers and a good taqueria which Diego told us about.  We feel really lucky that our time in Mexico was spent here and we would happily return again and again. We would happily recommend it to family and friends.,50,352

We arrived tired so when to shower to find there was not hot water . We complaint and owner moved us to another complex for the night ( the other place was fantastic) the next day we returned to saasil and we were moved to another apt.

Kitchen utensils were basic but missing bottle opener , can opener ,and wine glasses . No large pots either . There was no tv which for me was a shame as would have made it so much better .

Il problema di questo luogo è che manca di qualunque cosa, non c'è un negozio dove comprare acqua, non c'è un bar, non c'è un ristorante e ancora peggio non ci sono taxi (l'ultimo giorno abbiamo camminato 40 minuti sotto il sole prima di trovarne uno).

Il centro di Tulum è abbastanza vicino, il mare è più distante ma con le biciclette che sono incluse nella prenotazione ci si può arrivare tranquillamente e girare tutta la cittadina.

"From the outside it awakened the feeling of a typcial American motel along the road. It was simply some rooms, no common area, not even a restaurant and still quite pricy. Together with the fact that it was about a 5 minute Taxi ride from the central bus station of Tulum ( when asking 2 or 3 taxi drivers, none of them actually knew the hotel ) we first regreted our choice. We arrived around 7 PM and there was nobody at the lobby. After waiting a couple of minutes and ringing a bell several times we finally found someone who would give us the key to our room. And then the surprise ... the room was actually pretty descent. Clean, solid amount of space, private bathroom, two bigger beds enough for 3 people and WIFI in the room.  Another plus of this hotel is that you get bikes for",30,361
"We stayed there for one night. At 6 am, I woke up, suddenly. One of the staff members came into our shared dorm room drunk and touched me, and not in a nice way. I sat up immediately. When the guy realized I was a man, he was shocked and stuttered something along the lines of thinking I was a woman. Fortunately, my female travel companion was not in the room at that moment. Of course, we left as soon as possible.",10,362
"Posada El Hostelito is really good value if your on a BUDGET, it's safe very clean & the staff are so helpful. The owner & his family are really helpful kind people. I had a room that had 2 king size beds , AC/fan TV, & a bathroom. They do have old rideable bikes to hire as well. It's a convenient location with laundry Cafes supermarkets all walking distance. ",50,362
"I spent two nights at Posada El Hostelito with a friend. If you don't expect a 5 stars hotel (providing you are not paying for that) I think it is good value for money. Victor, his wife and his father are trustworthy, enjoyable people, always happy to help. It could be cleaner, but it's OK anyway, we were provided with clean sheets and towels. There are no big security features, as the lockers are small and not unbreakable, but overall it feels like a safe place, as Victor or somebody else for him is always around.  It is conveniently located near Tulum downtown (5 mins walking) and the beach is few pesos far by taxi. Perfect for easygoing people travelling on a budget.",40,362
"I stayed there 4 nights - because my roommates were so nice. We were like a family. If it hadn't been for this acquaintance, I would have left after the first night. Actually, I stayed there only because I didn't want to walk all the way back to the city centre and because it was cheap, only 100 Pesos / night.  There was a rat in the kitchen, and 4 giant cockroaches assembled on the ceiling every evening. They didn't come in the dormitory. The two owners (father and son) are nice and helpful. But they do not care enough about this place. It looks really run down. There is only one table that almost falls apart. There are only 2 chairs. The kitchen is badly equipped, there is not enough of anything. We ate out of the pots because there were not enough plates (we were maximum 5",20,362

"If you plan on staying out until 5am, this place will be fine for you. However if you're in the hostel from 9pm-5am and want to sleep, you will have festival-loud dubstep-infused-EDM pumping through your room. I'm so tired.",10,364
"The hostel is managed for young guys. They seem cool and friendly, but they're more worry about chilling and smoking pot than about caring about their guests (specially if you aren't a girl). Breakfast isn't included, they air-con didn't work and they just have too many beds per room. They didn't have hot water for a couple of days and when I complained about, the owner did not try to find any solution, he just said that they have problems with the gas company so it's not his fault (maybe's mine?). I also stepped on their dog excrement at the hostel corridor. I like dogs and I understood those things may happen but when I went to reception to warn that their dog had done that, the guy kept watching his computer and said ""yeah, I know"". What does it mean you know? Then clean it!",10,364
" If you knew, clean it! Then, the next day they took the bed sheets from my bed when I was out, so when I came back to the hostel and asked about them, they said they were sorry, but they thought I had left the hostel. I said that's ok, but I hadn't, so I'd like to have my bed sheets again, and they said sorry again, but at that moment they didn't have any clean bed sheets so I had to wait. I did wait all day, and after asking several times and getting as their only answer that it wasn't their fault if the washing company didn't bring the bed clothes to the hostel, the owner appeared around 23:00 and I told him about the situation. He complained to the reception guy, went to his bedroom and took a clean set of sheets from it. Like almost every night when I was there they had a party on the rooftop, it's very noisy and I had to wake up early next morning. I asked to myself what was I doing there. Next morning I cancelled my booking with them and found a better place to stay for the same money. It's plenty of them in Tulum! They say they are the cheapest, but that's just not true, specially since they don't give any breakfast. I think it's one of those places that only get full during the high season, when everything else is full as well. Definitely, I don't recommend it.",10,364

"We left our previous location two days early for Tulum which we were booked into another hostel but not until couple days later so we thought we will just stay here for two nights..  Wish we had access to wifi to look it up beforehand bloody hell. So the best part is having wifi in our room. Otherwise don't bother.. Two of us in a 4 bed dorm with no air con and one fan which didn't do much in the extreme heat. Bathroom was alright.  But sleeping wasn't an option, the extremely loud music was terrible and it didn't stop until around 5am.   Nothing else offered here it's a big no no!   Maybe look into the Mango Hotel it's away from the main busy town section but walking distance (heard it's nice from friends). ",10,364

"This has to be the worst place i have ever stayed at. And I am not a person who needs a lot to be satisfied with accommodation. The place was pretty expensive, considering what you get. The problem was that every other place was booked out. We stayed (2 people) in a room for 4 people. The room was dark, smelled, was not clean. You could literally see the mold on the curtains. Under the bed you could see trash, when going around the hostel we noticed some people doing drugs. We could not get any sleep since there was loud music all night. Really loud electronic music. since there was no real glass in the window it did not insulate the sound even a little. Went to take it up with the staff, but they did not care. We were so happy to get out of that place. Did not get any sleep.",10,364

"My friend and I were already regretting booking two nights at this hostel after five minutes of being there. Where do I start? As soon as we walked into the room it smelled of damp and mould. There was mould on the walls and on the pillows. We were given some bedsheets which didn't smell great either. The room was a TINY space into which they had crammed two bunk beds so you could hardly move. It was incredibly stuffy and boiling hot.  The guy at reception explained that we were only allowed to use the air con for TWO HOURS a day, which is ridiculous in that climate. He said we could ask for a fan if we got too hot during the night. When we went to bed we put the air con on, but realised that two of the glass windows in the room were BROKEN with big holes smashed in them so all",50,364
"Great location for a family of five. Clean, spacious, AC and wifi worked well. Close to the beach and downtown Tulum. It's perfect for a family that will be out and about, at beach or site seeing. Not a place you come stay at to hang out by the pool and in your room like a resort. ",40,365
"I stayed with friends in the bungalow which was off the street and thus more quiet.  The bungalow is three stories and has one single bed on the first floor (although you could fit more) two double beds on the second floor, and two single beds on the two third floor lofts.  While not directly on the beach, you can still get there by going through No Name directly across the street.  A quaint bar, and regular movie nights make Residencia Gorila Films (Casa Luna Limon's new name) a great place to stay without the extreme costs of other places in the area.",50,366
"We came and stayed here my wife and I with our children.  We loved the pool, the flowers and landscaping.  The backyard is a nice place to lay in the sun and tan, or do some remote work by the pool under a palapas or just relax.    One thing we noticed is the caretaker was friendly and welcoming.  Very honest and nice man.  There's a few long term renters who live there and they are also very friendly.  It's a good vibe.   It's a new area so there is new construction around, but it's mainly farther down the road now, the noise wasn't an issue during our stay.   We loved staying here for the convenience of the restaurants nearby.  There are lots to choose from.  You walk out the door and within 150 meters you have 4 restaurant options.  The food was always great.  There are some",50,367

Worst of all was the staff who lied and accused us of stealing from the owners and breaking a door to a storage, that 100% was broken before we came. At check in they didn't do any proper check probably because this way we wouldn't check every little corner of the house before we got there and they can claim us for money at the end of the stay. Awful people!",10,368
Had a great couple nights on the front end of a trip to the beach. Easy walking and safe to access the town of tulum.  Explored the local shops and enjoyed some amazing food!  Perfect for what we needed and our hosts were lovely with great advice on the area. ,50,369
Hice la reserva en este lugar hace aproximadamente 3 meses para el 1 de enero. Ayer me llega un mensaje del anfitrión pidiendo que busque otro alojamiento porque el ya no tenía lugar. Como lo hice vía booking les solicite ayuda y solo envían respuestas automáticas. Horrible experiencia.,10,369
"My wife and I spent a week at this wonderful in-town B&B. Paola and Rick are wonderful hosts. We felt part of their family for the week including Paola's mother and their four dogs (made friends with two of them).  Our room looked out on a small pool which we used exclusively for the week; the grounds are impeccably maintained as was the room. The morning breakfast, which we had every morning under the large palapa, was the creation of Paola and her mother. Any restaurant would have a hard time keeping up with the quality of this breakfast. Somedays we skipped lunch as it was so filling.  Paola and Rick offered great insights into local restaurants, all spot on, and we had incredible meals.  Tulum has become a foodie mecca with so many options and across various budgets.  Rick",50,369
"I and my partner on our 3rd time Tulum –Mexico Trip. Our stay at Sexy Vilas Tulum  was the worst and most unprofessional service we experienced.  Given address, was advertised under another name, no name or sign of Sexy Vilas Tulum.  No Reception.   After 40 min on the phone trying to get in touch with them, a guy appears from nowhere calling us by name saying that he will show us the room. (No excuses for our wait- very unprofessional) Room was very smelly and dirty. Bedsheets were very dirty of organic matter, cushions were yellow, towels were smelly. Disgusting.  Called the emergency number, again no answer, luckily we noticed the cleaning lady next door and requested to change all the above mentioned.  During our stay of 10 days cleaning never really improved, had to clean",10,370
"First the pros.  Great location.  Walking distance to local bars and restaurants.  Bed was comfortable.  TV had Netflix.  Cons. Many Cons.  This is an older property and shows it.  The 4:00 pm check in is not helpful.  There is no one on site to watch your bags, so you either sit there or drag your bags around town.  Our unit 302 PH looked like a dorm room.  Furniture from a garage sale.  2 towels for 2 people?  That's it.  If  you want anything else it is an extra charge.  Oh, the Salsa band across the street plays all night.  Nice.  The check out time is 11:00 am, so get out!!  Lastly, they emailed me and said I had to make sure I picked up all trash and tie them up in plastic bags!!  Isn't that a housekeeping job?  Never, never again.",20,371
We are an older couple in our fifties and sixties. We had come to Mexico for 2 weeks and had started and ended our holiday in Tulum. Our final hotel was in the town as we had been advised by a fried we might find the beach area boring. How wer after a noisy night with no sleep in the town we ventured to the beach area to try and find last minute accomodation for. 2 nights. It's an expensive area and our usual ear he's did not throw much up so I walked around the area and asked various small hotels what availability y they had. We found The Safe house which is opposite and owned by Mateo bar and grill opposite. They had rooms cheaply priced for the area. You do need to be are this is an expensive area so the price we paid was in line with everything else I think. I then read trip,30,372
" advisor and was a bit nervous as som of the reviews are pretty awful but I thin, you need to go in with your eyes wide open about what you are getting here and if you want beach access etc be prepared to pay more. Yes it was noisy up until around midnight then all was quiet, and if you stay here have a thought towards,others and don't party all night and be aware others will hear everything and I mean everything you do in your room as there is no insulation between rooms. The worst of this was the creaking of the floorboards in the room above us so you might want an upstairs room. But our s fond night we were pretty much the only ones here which was great. OUr room was rustic, clean, great bathroom, we had air con and a fan and mosquito net.  All in all if your expectations are appropriate then n it was fine",10,372

We paid an extortionate amount to stay here due to New years eve and lack of rooms available. There was no staff or security at the front desk. Very unsecure. Anyone can walk in off the street and the doors to the rooms are not secure. Our room had no proper curtains and our windows were facing the beach (honestly how hard can it be to put in some simple curtains!). The lock on the bathroom door was so rusty it could barely work. Very simple and bare. Concrete floor and spaces within the slats in the door. The walls are dead thin - you can hear next room talking and people walking in the room upstairs. Loud music from the bars across the road. Terrible location. The worst thing was coming back one day and finding our room door was LEFT OPEN AND UNLOCKED (the cleaning lady did,50,372
"I honestly don’t know why hotels are permitted in this area. The main reason for hotels is for rest and sleep. Sleep isn’t possible at this hotel due to location. The music from a number of restaurants/bars on the street goes until 4 am every night. Fortunately, I used my earbuds and listened to white noise all night on my phone.  Otherwise, the staff was friendly, and the hotel was clean and safe (maybe a little run down). If you want breakfast, it’s on the roof. Get there early before the food runs out. I wouldn’t stay here again, though, based on the noise from the street.",20,373
"I stayed here for 4 nights, it’s a great location and walking distance to everything. Lots of bars and restaurants around and awesome night life. The hotel offers free breakfast from one of the local restaurants which consisted of fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juice. Clean room and A/C worked well, rate was $36.00/night Canadian and the staff were very friendly. Only complaint I had was the neighbors dog across the street (I know it’s Mexico and barking dogs are part of it, but this thing was nuts)",40,373

There was a coffee machine in the room and coffee and drinking water were provided daily. The shower was hot, with good water pressure. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast provided at a restaurant nearby was very good-a choice of juice or coffee, and eggs, fruit and toast. The internet was mediocre at best. The biggest problem though is the extremely loud level of noise right next door to the hotel at night. We stayed for 2 nights (we cancelled our final 2 nights due to the noise) and the noise was too high on both nights-the first night it actually caused our headboard on the bed to vibrate!

They are feeders for Zuma Residence club where you will spend over 90 minutes being sold a membership.  I am not complaining about the property (although the rooms are small - no more than 4 can stay in any room on the property and have absolutely ZERO view.  My poor rating is due to their sketchy sales tactics.  They say the ""package"" includes a free breakfast.  Well, technically it does along with a 90+ minute sales pitch.

Book your excursions through a reputable source - not the guys on the street.  Here's how you know... ""Packages"" are $95 per person but before you even are told whats included it drops to $30 per person and then they throw a ""honeymooners special"" for $20 per person.

In the evening we were offered an othe hut which smelled even worse and it was very dirty but seemed to be dry. Nonetheless water sipped through the roof during the next night. Additionally we saw cockroaches and our clothes and backs adopted the odd smell of the hut. It was simply disgusting. The.sheets and.dishes were dirty from the beginning and again the owners left us alone. The last day we made a deal with the,10,379

Al llegar nos recibió un hombre de nombre Gabriel , quien dijo ser el administrador,  manifestó  que la habitación reservada (con dos meses de anterioridad) no estaba disponible debido a que tenía una filtración de agua,  nos ofreció  disculpas y  expreso que al día siguiente nos ubicaría  en ella, que esa  noche solo estaba disponible una habitación en el primer piso a mano derecha, sin otra opción y sin mayor problema, aceptamos. ¡Oh sorpresa, cuando en la noche vamos a la piscina y evidenciamos que todas las habitaciones estaban ocupadas por huéspedes! bastante molestos esperamos la mañana siguiente para el cambio, evento que nunca sucedió., Al preguntar a la mujer a cargo en ese",30,387
" momento dice que el administrador no dijo nada y todas las habitaciones están reservadas … En resumen, debimos pasar las dos noches en una habitación que no era mala, pero  no cumplía con los  requisitos que necesitábamos y que habíamos reservado. (Cabe destacar que esta Habitación en las que nos hospedamos no tenía ni lo mínimo de comparación a la reservada, muy reducida en espacio, poca privacidad, el baño y la ducha pequeña e incómoda, sin balcón que era indispensable para nosotros). Ella manifiesta hablar con el administrador, hombre que nunca puso la cara y por lo anterior les sugiero que busquen un hotel que cumpla con lo reservado, o en su defecto exijan  la habitación separada ya que por la sobreventa por parte del hotel, pueden tener no una buena experiencia.",40,387

"Jazmin quien nos recibió fue muy amable y abierta a darnos indicaciones de que actividades podíamos hacer en Tulum, la habitación fue bonita y muy completa, es un buen lugar para descansar después de un día entero de paseos por la zona",10,387
"La prima stanza che ci hanno fornito era molto spaziosa ed elegante con un design minimal, ma la doccia erogava pochissima acqua e ci hanno assegnato una stanza meno accogliente, ma con una doccia funzionante.  Prezzo della camera abbastanza contenuto, ma ho pagato per una stanza grande e ho usufruito di una più piccola. La posizione è abbastanza defilata, in una strada sterrata priva di servizi. Va bene solo per chi ha un'auto, a che perché la struttura non offre bici. la piscina è bella in foto, ma l'acqua è sempre stata torbida e non ci ha mai invogliato ad utilizzarla, anche perché non ha assolutamente spazio dove stendersi. Staff poco comunicativo, ma ugualmente disponibile per le informazioni di base",30,387
"DON'T visit this hotel!  At arrival on the 8th of August the hotel offered me a better price than my original reservation via booking. We agreed to cancel the Booking reservation and I paid the new total with my creditcard at the hotel.  I noticed that the other creditcard payment via Booking was still blocked and also collected by the hotel. After notifiying the hotel manager about the double payment I was expecting an apology and of course a refund of one of my two payments.  Instead, this hotel manager Carlos, who btw isn't present at the hotel and is only available to answer by WhatsApp message (if you are lucky), refused to pay any of the payments back and told me it was my fault that he was able now to collect and keep two of my payments!! What a scam! Unbelieveable.",10,387
" Disrespectful, but above all, how stupid can you be as a manager of your hotel.  After asking them and warning several times I had to call the police to fix this situation. Calling the police was also my only option to get Carlos to come to his OWN hotel. Because at this moment (from 8:00 a.m. untill 15:00 p.m. he was still too busy and refusing to pick up his phone while we were waiting to get our money back and start enjoying our holiday.    An half hour after the police arrived we saw a man coming in who immediatly started discussing with the police, without any introduction or what so ever. Later we found out this was the hotel manager Carlos... Hilarious act of the person that should've helped us with this situation   It's good to know that booking.com is very strict and protect their customers against fraud hotels such as this one. We received our total payment back at the day we checked out!!   -awful smell at the pool -construction noice  -no actual Road to the hotel -mosquitos everywhere in the room  NEVER AGAIN!!",50,387
"Poor customer service, the staff stole money out of our room. After we notified the owners they still charged us extra for the safety box. Dirty towels and the sheets had holes in them. Cockroaches under the beds. The owners woke us up in the middle of the night because they had forgot to give us a key for our friend who arrived a few days after us.",10,388
The room I was staying in had no lights and in 4 nights my room wasn't cleaned once. I wouldn't recommend this Hotel as there are many other options. 5min away from downtown and 15min from the beach!!,20,388
"Hotel Tulum is located in the center of Tulum with a 5 min drive to the beach! The rooms are nice and clean with high ceilings, hot water, wifi and air conditioning. The garden outside is beautiful and so is the architecture of the house.  The owners are very friendly and gives a very personal service. It feels like you are invited into their home. They were very helpful with any question we had and made very nice breakfast! Overall a super place to stay and very cheap comparing to other same quality hotels. ",50,388
"The owners, mother and daughter Veronica and Veronica, are very kind and have shown me their way of life here in Tulum. They have offered me some delicious Chilean and traditional maya food in great quantities and whenever I want to eat they provide me with something. There is plenty of fruit and fresh ingredients which give a healthy family atmosphere. I have a double bed and private bathroom all for 150 pesos which is one of the cheapest hostels around. It is slightly dirty but I don't mind too much.  Another positive is good wifi and space to relax rain or shine. Thank you for a good stay!",40,388
"The worst place i have ever stayed! Really, i wish that night never existed. Very dirty and messy hotel in general. Talking about room, still want to cry - dirty linen with hair, sand and spots on it. Uncomfortable bed, dirty towel (just one for 2 person), no hot water, bugs in the room and the smell was so awfull, can not tell in words. So stay away from this place!!! ",10,388
"This place is a dodgy rip off with torn sheets, dirty towels and cucarachas in the shower!   We ended up here out of pure desperation as during the high season nothing else was available. We booked it online, but upon arrival, we were told that due to an overbooking our room was no longer available. Our only other option was to stay in a room for triple the price. We had no other option but to agree.The room was absolutely not worth it!  5 min later I witnessed the receptionist telling the same filthy lie to another couple...",10,388
"They asked to pay the whole amount as we arrived and they informed us that no complain was admitted (regarding sheets, water missing, animals in the room...). Quite strange. Towels were missing and finally they gave us towels that smelled bad and had spots. It was quite clear that they were already used. The sheets were dirty and there was sand in my bed. We found a roach (cucaracha!) in our room. I know they are not dangerous but I prefer not to see them sneaking under my bed.  What else? Drain didn't work so the bedroom was flooded because of the shower! When it rains it gets really wet and you might find puddles next to the window in the morning. So I reccomend you not to leave your luggage next to the window at night.",10,388
"This is one of the dirtiest hotel I've stayed in. Unfortunately we arrived in Tulum without a reservation during high season and ended up at this place. The only room they had left was something more of a closet with a broken door which had to be locked with a chain and padlock. There were cigarette buts and hair laying around in the room. The sheets were dirty and since it's right next to the highway and had no fan or AC it was really noisy. The shared bathroom had no electricity, toilet paper or trashbin and was really dirty. For this room they charged 800 pesos which is an amount you almost could get an apartment in Tulum for.",10,388
"Nothing to add to the title. I cannot find any reasons why one should stay at this hotel. Stinky and mouldy rooms, dirty sheets and pillows, rude people at the reception. Our fault was to get to Tulum without reservation but at this conditions fat better to sleep on the shore!",10,388
In hindsight we would have taken our time to find somewhere else. The place needs a decent clean up and the initial service we got was average. Our room was adequate with plenty of faults and the club out the back ensured we got a bad nights sleep.,20,388
"Pésima experiencia   Llegamos en tiempo y forma y no había nadie que tuvieron que salir a una emergencia   Al día siguiente al bañarnos sorpresa el agua es salada! No es agua potable! Imposible bañarse ahí    Además el cuarto muy sucio... no había nadie ni ni día ni noche cuando según hay j. Encargado! Pero como es domingo pues descansan y entonces pues no lo renten!!!  Llegamos el lunes en la noche y no limpiaron  el cuarto y horas en recepción y ninguna respuesta!  Pésimo servicio, limpieza súper pobre, muy sucio! Y nadie sabe nada! PESIMO ",10,389
"We only stayed here for two nights after reading much better reviews on Expedias website.   There was some confusion at check in as I had not been contacted to advise on how to check in as reception is not all day, though once I had wifi I was able to call the hotel and they instructed me in.   The location is out of the way its within residential areas, though if you have a car hire you'd be fine. We didn't but on our journey to town we caught a taxi and took their what's app number and he would come to collect us when we needed (approx 50 pesos) just be sure to have an offline map like maps.me to help guide them as some seem to have never of heard of the street before?  The property though was nice, can see it is very modern and new. The room was large and had a fridge in with",40,389
 a wardrobe area and little seating area. The bed was huge and the bathroom (though our door didn't close fully) was good with a very powerful and warm shower.  All in all I would recommend to anyone just to be aware of the location.,10,389
"This place could be great but lack some care Staff is stressing, noone at front desk when we got there first Phone number not in function Cancellation difficult if mot impossible Wish they shake up and make it great",10,390
"Staff was rude, DRUNK, and aggresive. The property was dark and unkept. As a solo female traveller i felt slightly unsafe.  After ringing the bell for 5 minutes finally a man arrived, he smelled and acted drunk. He claimed to not have received my reservation for a dorm bed, and claimed that he had no more dorms left so put me in a private room. The room was barely a basic level of clean, the towel did not look clean at all. The rest of the property was very dark and unkept. I was told to never go by the main entrance but rather by the back entrance which opened up to a deserted back alleyway. Very shady stuff. When it came to paying, they wanted me to pay for the private room even though i booked a dorm. The alternative was to move to the dorm room which one person told me was",10,390
" available and another person said it was not available. Lots of confusing information was being thrown around and they were quoting different prices each time, the entire time they are being rude and demanding and impatient. I managed to negotiate with the lady a price to stay in the private room. Then the man, who was now even more drunk than before, got angry at me because I allegedly agreed to pay a much higher price beforehand (i never did). He was slurring his words and cursed at me. At no point during my stay did i feel welcome or safe.",10,390

"We stayed 2 times in this hotel. The first stop was somewhat ok. They don’t provide any normal blankets, the towels and sheets are very old and worn out with old stains on it. The second time was a complete disaster. The room was filthy, the floors were completely dirty. The bathroom was so dirty and humid that my husband did not want to take a shower in it. The toilet bowl was not cleaned. It was only one night so we had to deal with it. Please avoid this place.",10,391
"I was very happy to stay at Casa Babel, they had just opened a few days ago and were very friendly. Amenities are what you need for your stay, water pressure is great, WiFi works, the bar is cool and small pool great to hang out around! My favorite point: pet friendly! Both my cat and my dog were nicely welcome.",50,392

The hostel  is in 2 min walk to the club"" Infinito"".In the night bartender ; receptionist, a guy who repair air conditioners asked if I want to go out to the club .I said yes , I didn't want to leave my backpack with all important stuff in the room, there are no lockers, so I took it with me. So when WE CAME to the clubmThis people said is better to leave the backpack in their car ( who knows who is in the club??) so we came into club together and 2 min later there are gone with car and my money; phone and another stuff.

Couldn’t even brush our teeth, once again staff not helpful at all and was told “oh well that’s México” which is total crap as we have stayed in many hostels around Mexico and have never come across this problem.  Wifi is terrible.   The only good thing about this hostel was the location and the small dip pool area to chill out in.  Security is good. Always someone there to open the door.

"Un buon appartamento pulito vicino la zona con negozi, bar e ristoranti. C'è tutto quello che serve, buon rapporto qualità/prezzo Il proprietario è stato gentile, disponibile, educatissimo. Io e la mia compagna arrivati a Cancun ci siamo subito diretti a Tulum, qui ci siamo fermati solo una notte, il giorno seguente visita alle rovine maia e poi in partenza per Merida",40,393
"It is the worst room i have ever been. The area is dangerous. We are afraid to come back late at night. The room, bathroom and sheets  had an awful smell. That's why we were the omly residents in the whole building! We visited Tulum only for two days and unfortunatelly didn't have the time to find something else. I think that soon this place will close... Stay only at the beach area and you will definately enjoy your trip to lovely Tulum!",10,393
"Our entire 4 day stay without a working toilet!  Had to go to restaurants nearby for the bathroom.  The noisiest place you will ever stay,  We have two rooms and the same problems in both rooms.  The owner failed to mention there is still construction on this building and the building next door.  The work starts at 7am and goes til almost 9pm.  Then you have the barking dogs all night.  To boot, the toilet hasn't worked since we checked in.  I've asked 3 times to have it fixed to no avail.  Then you have a nice king size bed with queen sheets.  Dirty queen sheets with other peoples blood stains on them.  Two nights later we still cant get new sheets.  Someone came into our room while we were gone and put up some soap dispensers in the bathroom, fine.  He left screws on the",10,393
" shower floor which was stepped on and punctured a foot.  Not fine.  The water pressure is non existent so we have been showering at the hotel a some guy we met on the beach is staying.

"Amazing beach!!! Quiet and relaxing scenery. Crystal clear blue water, warm too. Great margaritas. Pricey chairs and massage service (the advertised price is for a regular massage) but great customer service, they accept card for this. Bar doesn't accept card. They also provide glamping (I didn't do this). ",40,394
"Las palmas glamping.   The location is super nice.   The stretch of beach right outside is nice and sandy and not too crowded (further down there is a short stretch with rocks, where you can't access the beach directly). That about it though.  For me it was amazing being able to wake up and walk directly to the beach without thinking about packing a bag and prepare for a day at the beach. That luxury makes up for a lot in my book.  What i do think you have to consider before choosing this place is:  - there is a machine/generator for electricity. That will be turned on from 18pm to 5am. It makes a lot of noise and if that was not loud enough the generator next door is at least as noisy if not more. When the generator is on you will have a little light around and in the tents.",10,394
" This also means that there is no wifi until 18pm. I have been sleeping with earplugs and for me it was actually enough to get a good night sleep.  The bathrooms are also dark during day time, almost no light enters when you close the toilet door.   - last night we came home around 3 in the night and the port to the camping was closed. We have at no time been informed that there will be limited access to the camp after a certain hour. Vi had to pass through another hotel and walk along the dark beach at night to be able to access the camping from the seaside instead.  It was completely black at the beach and it did not make the situation less scary that someone with a flashlight was following us. It was probably just some beach guard but we were a bit uncomfortable with the situation and started running towards the campin in the dark. A really annoying situation just because they had closed the access.  - the tents are quite old. The do not look at nice as on the pictures.  - Our tent had a broken zipper and the mosquito net was torn apart.  We could not lock the tent because of this broken zipper. Which made me even more nervous about leaving any values behind in the tent when going out.  We were offered to change the tent but then we would be closer to the noise of the generator. And if you have some dream about sleeping in a tent and being able to fall asleep to the sound of the nature and the sea - forget about it. All you can hear is the generator.  On the other hand you will have that nice sensation when waking up in the morning since it will be turned off around 05 am.  - There is a locker but you will not be able to access it yourself. You would have to hand over your values to the responsible lady and she would have to give them back to you. You can not access them when she is not available. She leaves around 18pm. For me this was not a solution. I need to access my belongings when they are needed.  - i think they could be better at refilling toilet paper and hand soap in the toilets. It is always like a little game guessing which toilet has the soap and which has the paper.  - we had not booked through hotels.com but we chose this place as well because it said online that there would be breakfast included and a fridge. The fridge did not exist neither did the breakfast. I hope the breakfast would have been included if we had booked through hotels.com. we asked the guy in the restaurant and he said that the restaurant was a separate thing from the camping and if the manager had not told us about breakfast it would not be included.  Let me give you an advice.. If you are really desperate to stay at the beach but everything online seems booked or too expensive, my experience is that it is cheaper to ask the price in person upon arrival. I think we paid 1600 pesos pr night for a sad tent but when i went along the beach and asked for prices and availability i found really nice places for 1800 pr night no tent and even better locations.",10,394

"Me and a friend booked this place because it was the cheapest available on the beach and it made our entire trip a nightmare.  I don't even think it's a real hotel - the people that work there speak broken English and Carlos, the kid who runs the place lives above the open-air lobby.  They use a 3rd-party cleaning service and the owner is never there. Carlos gave us an upper room on the side next to a property that was under construction and there was a platform along side our room that someone easily used to come in our room and steal my backpack which had my Passport and GoPro camera.  When we raised a fit to Carlos and said to come with us next door, he said they wouldn't go next door and complain because ""they are not people we want to deal with"".  Of course when we went",10,396

Given we were leaving the next day and had other plans it was useless to call the cops and we got the hell out of there and stayed in the city that night and moved on - all the way to Merida to get an expedited Passport.  Carlos has an honest face and speaks very good English but only when he needs to, otherwise suddenly his English isn't very good when there's a problem.

"They sell it under different names over Airbnb. Very basic and very small cabanas. The ""double"" bed was too small for a 1,85m guy.   We paid 150$ per night. It was worth 10$!   Positive: beautiful view from the balcony and nice beach.  ",20,397
"Absolutely disgusting!  Filthy dirty, smelled like urine a JOKE of a hotel/cabana.  The desk clerk/owner couldn't find any keys for the room; it's horrible that they are even in business.  Very shady and scary - wouldn't spend a night there.  We immediately called a different hotel and left El Caracol.  Hotels.com better make sure do drop this property!  NOT a double bed.  I've stayed in some crappy places over our 25 years of traveling the Yucatan coastline and this is by far the worst experience we've ever had.  Disgraceful!  We spent good hard earned money on this trash dump.  Hotels.com should be ashamed of representing this on their site.",10,397

"To keep it short and simple, the staff was horribly rude, the rooms were DISGUSTING and they had a bug problem. There was no wifi despite their claims, and there were cockroaches everywhere. When is rained, our room leaked. We never had enough towels or toilet paper and nobody was ever around to help us. This was the grossest hotel ive ever stayed at, hands down. My hotel in Haiti was nicer, no joke.",10,397
"Ok... Went to Tulum, had to stay a few nights, had no reservations, found this place. For what you're payin, it's not that bad. 180.00 for a beach front cabana w/AC (at night) the views are amazing and if ya really feel the need, bring some clean sheets and pillow cases... Maybe we got lucky cause ours were fine. No weird smells or anything like I read in another review. Beach front on a budget.... Nothin more... nuthin less.",30,397
We were attracted by the cheap rate that he had posted on the sandwich board outside. And the initial excitement over the amazing view quickly dissolved when we noticed a strange smell from the septic tank was filtering into the room. We couldn't get rid of it for the duration of our stay - It lasted the whole time we were there and made it very challenging to even sleep but we had no choice as we had paid upfront. The manager was never there to help out with any questions.  We had to ask for toilet paper and towels constantly. I definitely would not stay here again. On the last morning the power went out and we were groping around in the dark hitting our heads on everything.

Pretty much anything else that could be wrong with a hotel room was.   There were several dead Mosquitos on our bed sheets and pillows when we arrived. Holes and stains in mosquito net. Weird red stains on pillows. I pray it was just chili sauce. There was a spider web in the light above the bed.We ran to the supermarket - bought two cans of bug spray- and basically fumigated the room before sleeping there.   The shower was basically a rusty pipe hanging above the toilet. No water pressure. Almost unusable. No drinking water.   The room was disgusting. Dirty utensils, rust, stains everywhere.

We had to pry for more information from the receptionist and learned that they did not have AC OR RUNNING WATER. We were already tired from our day of traveling and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and felt a bit reassured when told ac would be restored at 10pm.

The bad: at that price range, in that area, you expect more than what was offered. I did not get the room that was booked as the beautiful crochet headboard was missing, the room did not have a safe and it had to be installed on request. The tap water was a tad bit salty. I requested an ice bucket and it was leaky so the next morning there was watermarks all over the floor which housekeeping didn't even bother to mop up that day.

" sleep is in my tent on the beach.    so onto my experience at una noche mas - i camped on the rooftop which is a mix of storage/laundry drying/sometimes a hangout.  i don't recommend it during the wet season which is what i did.  but i only had 1 day with torrential downpours where i literally had a river run through my tent and the other nights were warm and breezy enough that i stayed several more nights.  ceasar let me keep my valuables in the lockers in the women's dorm. - the common bathrooms were cleaned daily and it was clean enough for me.  the showers have no water pressure so you have to be patient.  if you're a woman and stay in the dorms, you have your private bathroom. - the kitchen was also cleaned daily and basic.  i didn't use the kitchen much but i knew someone who cooked up a storm in there--he was a chef.  with the hot weather, it's great that cesar provides drinking water. - bicycle rentals are the cheapest you'll find!  my friend and i went to the cenotes and when we found out that her tire was flat, i called cesar and he came quickly with another tire and we were on our way. - when i arrived, the atmosphere was quite festive. they had a going away party for one of the long term guests with yummy pizza and beer.  the subsequent days, i made friends and went to the beach with one friend on one day. and i explored cenotes with another friend the next.  on a friday/saturday night a group went out drinking and dancing nearby but i went to sleep early. - wifi worked perfectly from the kitchen area and the roof for basic internet surfing. - while i was there cesar was building on restaurant on the ground floor which might turn into a nice hangout in the future. - if you're tired of schlepping your bag, stay here b/c it's super close to the bus station.  when i arrived fyi cesar was nowhere to be found but i just hung out and checked out the rooftop where i wanted to camp and he eventually showed up. and it was just as easy when i was leaving--i went to the bus station to ask about times earlier in the day and then walked the block and half with my bag easily to the bus station.  a tip about tulum:  i loved staying in town.  i planned on camping on the beach but decided that staying at una noche mas was better b/c i could borrow bikes and bike to the beach easily as well as go to cenotes as i pleased.  the beach is far so you either need to rent bikes the whole time you're staying there or take the combi/walk or take taxis which are expensive.   this is mexico so if you want modern comforts, pay modern tulum fees which are more expensive than other parts of mexico.  believe me, i asked around.  if you can 'rough' it mexican style, stay with cesar.  he has a very interesting history and is awesome to talk to--you really should practice your spanish while you're in mexico anyway!  and you'll experience true mexican hospitality.",40,400

"If you are looking for Western comfort,stop reading this.This place is perfect for low budget backpacker or traveller ,Cesar,the owner,was one of the best person I ever met in my life,we spoke hours and hours and he open my eyes on mexico.Room are really simple but space it's the last thing you need if you are travelling across mexico,you very to share kitchen and bathroom with other mates around the world,during night time you can share your tips and chitchat with everybody inside the house and practice your Spanish. Don T forget,and cesar won the do it,to sign the wall in the reception! ",20,400
"we stumbled into this place to get out of the rain (its super close to the bus station) and ended up staying for lack of a better idea. our mattress was comfortable, but filthy, the sheets didnt fit the bed. there was a stand alone fan which was excellent in cooling our room the bathroom was also filthy - pubic hairs in/around the toilet, showers not clean, bathrooms not cleaned in the 24hrs we were there kitchen looked well enough equipped ok for the night, but i wouldn't (and didn't) stay longer",20,400
"Although this hostel is very cheap and the owner is very nice, it's one of the worst hostels I've seen. In general everything looks very dirty and the shower is one drop at the time, so hair washing for a girl is almost an imposible mission. Fortunately, I only needed to crash for a few hours till my bus departed at midnight, but I don't think anyone can stay there more than a day.",20,400
"Great location in the middle of town, cheapest accomidation in the city. 6-8 beds per room, few outlets that are near the ceiling, paper thin sheets, lumpy pillows, friendly staff. The tiny upstairs shared kitchen is the only common area, not very comfortable for socializing. They do bike rentals for 60 pesos as well. If you just need a place to sleep, this is it, if you want more of a social life, lounge, reliable wifi, look elsewhere. For the ultra cheap, they allow you to camp on the roof for half the cost of a dorm.",20,400
Okay so we had a room with basically no walls. The ceiling was made of plastic and room barely fit the bed. Our stay started with a one hour wait for the owner to even get a key to the room! We did not want to leave our baggage unattended. This is not a hostel for anyone with ears since the walls are non-existent and therefore extremely noisy.,10,400
"I paid for six nights, but could only stay four. Part of that was not the hostel's fault--someone staying in my shared room had contracted dengue fever in Cuba, and I didn't want to risk getting it. That said, the hostel staff did nothing to alert or warn guests, even those like me who had already paid in full. I didn't expect a refund, but a ""hey, this is something you should know about and these are the steps we are taking to prevent transmission"" would have been nice.  Anyways, that's unlikely to affect your stay there. But the building itself wasn't in very good shape and, although rooms were cleaned daily, it never felt like enough. Showers were sometimes hot, sometimes not. Amenities offered were few, but they do rent bikes for 50 pesos per day, which is about 30 pesos",30,400
"The price is pretty low but you can definitely do better in the pueblo for the money with some shopping around.  The place isn't terrible and we've certainly stayed in worse but it's just alot of little things are below standard. Probably the worst thing about it was that it is an especially noisy place. On the positive side it was a clean place, gotta give it that.",20,401

Informal hostel.  Big kitchen available for your use.  Pool table.  I used the tent option which I enjoyed.  It even rained pretty hard the first night but my tent kept me dry.  Air bed in the tent was comfy. They have other options besides the tents. People are friendly.  Kind of a family atmosphere.  Wifi was good.  Hot water not always available but the cold water isn't freezing.  It is about 3 blocks off the main drag so quiet by comparison.  Breakfast included and free coffee. I don't think you can beat it for the price.  Nice thing about the tent was the privacy as compared to a dorm type bed.,20,402

" decorated and very warm home feel (take advantage of this!). The pool is a great addition that I wasn't expecting, and they can rent you bikes to move around the small and beautiful town/almost city of Tulum. The hammocks upstairs are delicious and I hope can be preserved since they're delicate and fragile. The pool table in the living room is also the best little surprise ever! Not to mention the fact that the big led screen in front of it is smart and if you know how to use it you have infinite apps [Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, cell phone connectivity for your music library, movies, series, photos (anything you can think of, technology now-a-days is amazing!!!), Wifi, or you could bring along your own consoles or whatever you’d like to enjoy and share.  Also the kitchen is well equipped and the patio is beautiful, let’s make it better on your visit, maybe you could gift a flower pot with a personal taste of yours, maybe fruit trees or even help make a Home Garden with useful vegetables like carrots, potatoes, lettuce, onions, habanero, jalapeños, tomillo, tomatoes, beans, garlic, basil, celery, cinnamon, etc etc etc. Ask for advice on what you’d like to leave behind, maybe even just a small message on their chalkboard walls.

Only stay at this place if you like noise!  There is a live DJ all day from 9am to 22hrs or later blaring music non-stop from the beach bar.  For accomodation you have a choice of camping or beach cabins.  The cabins are basic to the max - and way over-priced for what you get.   The ground floor cabins consist of a mattress in the middle of sand so you might as well camp for a third of the price!   The upstairs cabins have a wooden floor at least....but not much else.  The mattresses are old and sagging and the mosquito nets look like they have never been cleaned.   Breakfast involved almost a 1 hour wait and when it eventually arrived it was unedible.  I have nothing positve to stay about this place!  Go a few blocks down and you will find better value and more comfortable,10,406
Staff are amazingly nice. Nice breakfast when booked with booking.com.  Large room and kitchenette.. but way too muggy and warm to not have a/c.

Next time, said Roberto, check your bed more attentively. When I answered that there will be no next time, Roberto accused me on the aggressiveness and told that he’s going to call the police! Honestly, I was angry (who would not be in such situation?), but far from being aggressive! I told Roberto that I can explain everything and show the police all my personal belongings, piece by piece, to prove that I am not a thief. Roberto’s response was – “All",10,411

"Este hotel es una pura estafa. Se rompió el boiler a la 1 de la manana mientras dormíamos, dejando nuestra habitación inundada y llena de humo. No solo nos asustamos muchísimo, sino que nos quedamos a la 1 de la manyana fuera de la habitación buscando al personal desesperadamente. Tras más de 10 intentos de llamar por teléfono fallidos, llega la duenya en un estado inaceptable y no nos da ninguna solución, montanto una escena de película, sin entender ni poder hablar una palabra. Tuvimos que coger maletas y salir del hotel y dormir en el coche. El dia siguiente fuimos a reclamar el dinero y no nos devolvieron ni un céntimo. No entiendo como algo así de injusto puede pasar en pleno siglo XXI, es una verguenza y nos robó paciencia, tiempo y ganas. No se lo deseo a ningún otro",30,412
I took my kids (9 and 10) on their first paddle boarding adventure. The guy that was manning the school for the day was awesome. He was friendly and helpful and got us in the water with some instructions as we were determined to try it ourselves alone. A freak storm came in and whisked us out to sea a bit and he was right there with a friend to help us back in...I don't know what we would have done with out him! His paying attention to us saved us. The sea is usually very calm and so peaceful-this was a rare storm that came in quickly and our naivety of the ocean got us in a tight spot but we were quickly rescued. I can't say enough about the beauty of the place and the welcome feeling we got at Kite beach rental. I will go back again. The only thing I wish for was better,50,413

We found this charming place while walking to the beach and fell in love with the comfort and decor.   The staff is European and very knowledgeable about where and when to go sightseeing.  The back of the house leads to a secret lagoon with a beautiful cenote.  We loved the place so much we stayed an extra week.,50,414

The hostel doesn't look like the pictures AT ALL. It is quite dirty and no privacy at all as there are no windows (so you hear everything from the common area) and as half of the hostel goes through your dorm room while you are sleeping to have a shower.   There were also no lockers available.   The atmosphere is nice and the location too but don't go there if you want any sleep,20,415
"Nice people,nice place always with shadow and chill.the dorms are spacey and and every day was cleaned by a really nice lady.Charly the owner of the hostel is always around and more than willing to give you the best up to date information about everything!if you want some relaxing days in Tulum la cigana is the place!

"Beds are uncomfortable, the place is noisy and dirty, and the owner's cats get into rooms are beds (I ain't got nothing against cats in general, but they're dirty and one might be allergic). They try to give a cool or bohemian atmosphere to the hostel but is all fake and once you pay they don't care about you anymore. Breakfast is so bad, just the minimum to say they give breakfast included, but not any ""love"" in it. Since I was in Tulum during the high season, and it's really hard to find accomodation then, I had to stay more days that I wanted at La Cigana. During those days they changed the prices of the rooms so randomly, and also saw with my own eyes how they make overbookings and then taking no responsibility. I had to help myself two girls from Korea to find a place to",10,415

Having said this the location is ok, next to a pretty cool cafe and mojito bar, although both are expensive.   Overall I was pretty disappointed with experience, my partner and I booked a private room which turned out to be opposite the hostel not in the hostel, it wasn't very clean, which is the biggest disappointment. It also has no hot water, which is ok in Tulum, but it's disappointing when considering how much we paid.

Sin embargo tuvimos problema con el aire acondicionado ya que utilizan celdas eléctricas y no es suficiente.  Ese detalle, que las albercas no se veían tan limpias y que el camino de acceso no es tan sencillo serían los únicos puntos en contra.

It had a great outdoor rooftop common area where we could all hang out and eat in the little amount of time we spent at the hotel. Jaime (on-site) was super helpful when we needed and Anj (concierge) was very helpful in pre-trip arrangements and helping to ensure everything ran smoothly while in Tulum. Would definitely stay here again whether a large group or even a small one and just rented 1 or more rooms.",50,417
"Do not stay here. Well you couldn't even if you tried. Their management is a group of con men. We booked the Mojave 5 months fully paid and when we showed up to the door they informed there were no rooms, but they had rooms at their sister property the Amansala Resort 20 minutes away. It's pretty clear they are running a scam to get more people to stay 20 minutes away at Amansala. They are using the Mojave as a way to lure people into a trap, forcing them to stay at Amansala out of necessity when they are told they do not have a room. If it was just us, I would say ""oh they must have overbooked"" but it happened to 8 other people we know. On top of that, every single person that took up the offer to go stay at Amansala got sick from whatever hellish food/water they served them,",10,417

They sent us emails asking if we wanted to “upgrade” to amansala which is no where near Mojave, So we said no. We arrived to the hotel to learn they don’t have a room for any of our reservations. 1 couple agreed to move to amansala and are now staying so far away from the action and their “upgrade” was a lie - Amansala is not a nice hotel, they have no ocean view as promised and no air conditioning. The rest of us had to scramble to find a new place to stay literally day of because we wouldn’t agree to being kicked out to the other terrible hotel. Which of course ended up being extremely costly.

Cafe downstairs is amazing and a great bonus with breakfast (hot dish and 1x coffee) included there!  Rooms are even more amazing than the pictures! The whole place is like a giant treehouse with a hammock on the very top to watch the sunset!  Lots of nightlife, which might not be so good if you're a light sleeper!

"I recently had five nights booked at this hotel.  I spent the first night with a fan that barely worked, no hot water and no WiFi. The room is not as advertised in terms of it’s amenities and it does not look like it does in the photos. Adding to this, there was the constant smell of raw sewage that never seemed to dissipate and constant noise from construction and the road. One positive is that it is very conveniently located.   Making this stay worse, I discovered that a hurricane was projected to hit the area on what would have been the second night of our stay. It was projected to be a category 4, and there were recommended evacuation orders in place. Not wanting to deal with any of that I left town. Now, the property owner Maria is refusing to give me a refund for the final",10,420

The service was better than we expected (daily cleaning) and the staff were always available and super helpful and friendly - just down the driveway at Mamasan. Mamasan is a definitely worth visiting for food and drinks as well. On our first night we had the whole baked fish and arugula salad - it rivaled Hartwood and Kitchen Table in taste and quality :) The morning smoothies and juices are also super fresh and tasty. The rooftop bar is great for cocktails too, and I loved trying the different types of mezcal recommended to me by our lovely waitress!   Some logistical",50,422
" details:   - We had a rental car and there was parking for us and a few other guests along the driveway. It's a bit tight for space, but totally doable :)   - We rented bikes from in town (Ola Bikes) and biked around a lot! It can take a bit to get used to (lots of traffic/taxis/pedestrians/cyclists along the one, narrow road that goes along the beach) but it's a great way to get around to different restaurants, shops and the beach so you don't have to worry about parking.   - It takes about 35 minutes to bike into town from the cabins at Mamasan.  - There are a ton of other restaurants within walking, biking, and driving distance from the cabins  - Because we weren't totally sure from the listing, this property has 8 suites in 4, double story cabins that are set back behind the restaurant/accommodation lobby.   - To get to the beach, you can easily walk through any of the beach resorts on the other side of the street.   - For Wifi, our cabin (the one furthest from the restaurant) had access most of the time (some other reviewers said they did not have access in their cabin.) Occasionally it would cut out, but came back within a few minutes. At Mamasan, the lower level is an amazing, open air, stylish seating area with very comfortable couches, tables, etc. Perfect for working (if that's necessary - I think everyone would enjoy their job if they could work from here.) Here (just steps from the cabin) it has great wifi strength and power outlets too.  To the points made by the other reviewer:  This is the beach area of Tulum!  It is one narrow road in and out - and incredibly popular (for good reason - it is paradise.)   The area overall is struggling to handle the volume of people that want to visit - there are generators everywhere, water is scarce, and plumbing is more rustic than many people are probably used to.  This is not a fault of the this accommodation in particular, it is a challenge that everyone in this area deals with and is not by any means limited to these cabins.",10,422

" tugged behind the main street that was super cheap but super tasty, something like 5 pesos each, the Mexican guy that was making the tacos had blue, blue eyes (which is unusual in this part of Mexico).  We also found a white 'tent' right on Tulum Avenue where an Arts and Crafts festival was going on, it was set to end on Dec 20th or 21st of 2015, there, we got lots unique souvenirs for a good price. They had things coming from all corners of Mexico, it was somewhere in between the ruins and our hotel right on the south side of the main street, not to far from the banks.",20,432

"The rooms themselves are nice, but the hotel is located a bit of a walk from most of the shops and restaurants in Tulum and quite far from the beach. It would be fine to get around if you rented a bike though. The shower was terrible though - only a trickle of water and cold, my friend and I were rinsing our hair in the sink. Also, you need to walk outside to get wifi and it's kind of spotty - I had to move around a lot to keep a signal. The staff were friendly and helpful though, and there was ample parking available if you had a rental car.",40,432
"My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights. We liked the location, it was clean and spacious, the front desk was nice and there was free parking (we rented a car for 2 days). Three things we did not like: 1) the shower was probably the worst we had (just a trickle the first night and barely more on the second) 2) we put the do not disturb sign out during our day out as we didn't want our room cleaned for the one full day we were there and they went in an cleaned it anyway 3) wifi didn't reach the room (had to be outside to get free wifi). Overall a good deal for a nice no-frills kind of place.",40,432
THIS HOSTEL IS A DISGRACE. It's changed hands since going online apparently and has fallen into complete disrepair. The pool is a swamp. The air con doesn't exist. The room is a sauna. And filthy. The staff are rude. The breakfast doesn't exist. The wifi doesn't work. The owner is a crack head. DO NOT STAY HERE. ,10,433
"Akadia has a chilled vibe and plenty of facilities. The hostel has lots of open space, hammocks to chill in and a kitchen. There's also space for people who want to camp too. The beds in the dorms are completely enclosed in material except for a small hole with a curtain to get in so you have more darkness and privacy than in most hostels. While I was there they were in the process of making improvements to the hostel which should be great once complete. The girl at reception in the mornings was especially helpful as well.",40,433
Everything about this hostel is great! I went straight back there during my second visit to Tulum! The staff are great! The layout is really funky and the artwork is breathtaking to say the least... and it has a huuuge garden/patio area.. The location is perfect! Right in the heart of the town. And it's a really good price for Tulum... I now have so many lovely memories of this quirky original hostal! If you're a music lover i recommend it 100% they're all incredible musicians... viva akadianos!,50,433
"I have never given a 1/5 review before, so consider myself to be a fair, level-headed reviewer - but this place took the biscuit.   First I arrived and it didn't even seem like a hostel, just an open courtyard and a horrible looking place. Also there seemed to be a 6 year old manning the reception area. On approach the child ran off and a guy appeared from around the corner so I gave him my details - he then disappeared. A second guy arrived (I assume they both work there, but who knows) to tell me that they didn't have my reservation. Ok these things happen I guess (although I suspect they happen here more often than other places) - so he offered me a different bed (free of charge) for my 1st night and then the room I had booked for the 2nd night. Fair enough. He showed me to a",10,433
" room and pointed to my top bunk bed... only there was no mattress! He told me they would go get me one. A few minutes later a 3rd chap arrived and led me to the upstairs dorm (which is horrid btw) and showed me 2 free mattresses. He disappeared and left me to carry a bloody mattress downstairs, a felt like a right idiot. So eventually I put my mattress on the bed and had a look around the room....then one of the other backpackers in my room confirmed what I suspected - this was a female only dorm (Im not female). I left and found a different hostel.     Offering female travellers the security of lady only dorms (and taking payment from these girls), and then putting a man in the room is not just incompetent but borderline criminal. It's one thing to cock up my reservation, but to then attempt to rectify it by compromising the security that they offer female travellers is absurd. There are plenty of decent, honest hosteliers and BnBs around in Tulum - don't give these jokers your custom.",50,433

One of the best things is that they have a big backyard with and amazing swimming pool, hammocks zone to chill out and relax and cool paintings on the walls. Mexican food for breakfast is delicious. I hardly recommend to stay in Akadia if you come to Tulum.",30,433
"I'm a pretty easy-going traveler, and if the place is clean, I'm usually happy. Booked a room online for 3 nights. It took 3 phone calls, one email and one Facebook message for them to confirm the reservation. Then we got there and it literally smelled like poop. There was some kind of problem with a drain. It was bad. They also advertise their swimming pool but the water was green and filthy. The room wasn't ready and it took about two extra hours before we could leave our stuff. Then they couldn't find the key to our room... then no window + no AC in the room, so we were boiling at night... we had to keep the door open, so hello mosquitos! We got bitten all night. Then the next morning I went to the bathrooms to take a shower... they had just cleaned it but it was still very",40,433
" gross. When I turned the water on, dirty water overflowed from the drain everywhere - in the shower, on my feet and on my stuff. After that we just left. It took about 45 minutes to do the check-out because no one was really helping us at the desk... just run away from that place! GROSS!",40,433

Me and my girl friend live in New York City and go there twice a year. We love it.   Look its not at the beach or in the center of town but thats a good thing because the center of town can be loud with traffic and construction. Staying by the beach can be extremely expensive and the wifi will suck and the AC can only be used certain hours a day. Yes its secluded but if you dont have a car any taxi will be happy to pick u up there just ask them for a business card.  Spacious, clean, secluded, gated, very safe and most of all well kept. The place is at the edge of town, which is great because it is so quiet and peaceful. Other condos in the center",40,434
" of town can be noisy, have traffic or construction near them. So the Blueberry is great because its hidden and very quiet. And you are only 5min taxi cab to the beach. 25min by bike. its so quiet sometimes during the day you can sit by the pool and get lost in your own thoughts. The pool is cleaned daily and has an area for diving - so if you have a waterproof camera it makes the fun endless. The condo is gorgeous and very spacious. The kitchen is very nice and well equipped - as i love to cook. Bathrooms, bedrooms are great and huge - and they provide AC in every room which is very hard to find in Tulum. The maid comes every week and provides clean sheets, tons of fresh towels and leaves the place like new. Another great thing is that since Im always working from the road their wifi is excellent. The owners are always easy to reach if you need anything. I stayed there for almost a month and there were days we would not even leave the property - play tunes on the wifi, chill by the pool and use the grill to make some great food. Yes, there's a very nice grill and they even provide all the equipment. its walking distance to markets, restaurants, groceries, etc. All in all its a great place. A great choice.",50,434

"To the left of this hotel: $300/night rooms. To the right: $300/night rooms. Camping Maya Luum: $10/night. This was such an incredible find, I've spent the majority of my vacation here. I did take a 1 day break to sleep in a real bed and use a good shower, but then I headed right back.  You will literally sleep in a tent with a view of the beach. The Sea breeze will be more than sufficient air conditioning (I wore light long sleeves/pants to sleep, and the temperature can be moderated by adjusting the opening of your tent flap. I brought my own tent, but I'm pretty sure they have some for free (but please don't quote me on that).  The beach is perfect, except for the seaweed (but so far this seems to be a problem at every eastern Yucatán beach I've seen). The sand is clean, the",50,435
" water is a great temperature and there are basically zero rocks. The beach is essentially private, shielded by rock outcroppings and only accessible via 3-5 resorts. The majority of the beach belongs to Maya Luum but if they're feeling charitable, they let the visitors from the neighboring resorts wander onto their part of the beach (I'll repeat this: the $10 place has a beach x10 nicer than the $300 ones).  Accommodations are sparse. Bring a flashlight and all your own toiletries, towels, etc. They have Styrofoam coolers and you can buy your own ice 100m down the road. The water pressure in the showers leaves much to be desired and there is no hot water (but with the climate around here, I doubt you'll even want it). The bathrooms have no lights. The toilets must be flushed using a bucket you fill yourself (trust me, it's not too bad). There is a shared dining area and a very simple kitchen. They provide safe drinking water.  You will meet many other interesting people here. Just a warning, if you are thinking about bringing kids, at least consider beforehand whether you are OK with them seeing nudity on the beach (not overwhelming, but present most days) and whether you can tolerate proximity to people ""partying"". I found that the sound of the sea drowned out any of my loud neighbors.  The site is located at the very beginning of the hotel district, so it's a very short drive into town. You could get by with the adjacent bike and scooter rentals, though I have a rental car (parking is available). There is a Chedraui (Walmart equivalent) a 5 minute drive away. Within 100m is a convenience store and some restaurants, all of which are priced for tourists. You'll probably have to venture into town for authentic and appropriately priced food. ",40,435

If you truly want to have an off-the-grid amazing relaxed vacation, this is the real deal.  You may either visit here for the day ($5USD) or you may bring your own tent or stay in a cabana.  We have come to this place many times because of its relaxed back-to-nature vibe.  There is limited electricity and water, but you are right on the beach and steps from all the action of Tulum-Bocapaila.  If you wish to go au naturel (nude) this is accepted.  You have never had a vacation until you have camped on the beach and frolicked in the ocean without a bathing suit weighing you down.  Look for Erwin",50,435

Got a fantastic price for this all inclusive resort so we decided to go for a week's visit.  Check-in was immediate and extremely simple.  We had a cocktail in our hand 30 minutes after arrival.  Room had a slight musty scent from humidity but there was an incense burner in the room which took care of that in short time.  Plugs in wall had two USB ports for charging as well as numerous plugs throughout room.  We had a junior suite so we had a private swimming moat directly out our back patio door.  King size bed was comfortable and sitting area was well decorated.  Spa tub and stand alone shower in bathroom along with his and her basins for cleaning up.  TV had cable channels and WIFI worked acceptably.  Came to rest not work or watch TV so no problem.  Room is stocked with some,40,436
" beer and sodas and water.  Food is plentiful and varies according to taste, one thing I can say is that this place tries hard to cater to guests.  Numerous outdoor BBQ's, shows, vendors keep things hopping.  Things for the kiddos to do and many trips are available.  Not a huge night partier so listened to live music but did not attend late night events so cannot comment.  Few mentions.  Anna in the lobby is a great waitress and was very helpful, Victor at Seaside Restaurant was a great waiter and very pleasant.  Executive Chef at Seaside should be proud, great food and staff had us coming back there for many of our meals.  All staff we encountered were great and an asset to the resort.  We did attend a presentation it was quick and we decided not to buy, no high pressure here.",50,436

This place exceeded my expectations. 3 families consisting of 6 adults and 14 “kids” ranging in age 12-21. Food was so good.  Service was excellent. Kudos to Ms Irene(chef) Jose Kim Limberg and the cleaning crew daily. Best place ever. ,50,437
"Family with 14 adults (ages 19 - >60) and 5 children ages 2 - 13 stayed here in July.  We opted for the chef.  The main house was great and we realized that we used the living room maybe 3 times during the week.  This was due to the awesome outdoor area.  There are large outdoor couches around the pool, chairs on the beach with good tree shade, hammocks on the beach, and our favorite place:  the large palapa with a large table and plenty of chairs.  Most of us spent the majority of the time in the palapa, about 8 feet from the water.  When the breeze was coming in from the ocean it was very comfortable.  There was also a very large covered sitting area on the roof which had a couch and awesome view of the area.  Every bedroom was great, and I personally stayed in one of the",50,437
" guesthouse rooms.  It was great for 2 of us and had a newer AC unit for night time.  The house is not air-conditioned, but each bedroom is.  I personally think the website needs some better pictures of the outdoor area, because I was blown away by that.    The chef, Jose, was great and at first I didn't know what to expect.  It turned out he made plenty of food and we had leftovers for every meal.  You choose what you want him to make for each meal, and he goes into town and buys the groceries.  For this you need cash daily for him to make the purchases, but we knew that ahead of time.  We all had nothing but compliments for each meal.  The housekeepers and grounds keeper cleaned the whole villa up each morning and it never had that ""partying for a week"" look.    A couple things to keep in mind.  You can't flush anything down the toilet anywhere in that area, Tulum included.  Sooo, you can use your imagination as to some issues this causes.  Second, you are provided filtered water to do things like brush your teeth, and you can run out of tap water if a faucet is left on (kids).  The staff did a great job of helping us out when this happened, so it ended up not a big deal.  It is pretty secluded and there is about a 5 minute ride down the alleyway with speed bumps every 25 feet or so.  If you come from Cancun, try to pick up what you think you'll need for those off items, because you'll likely have to go to Tulum to get anything.  I think it's one of the pricier houses, but it's huge, has an awesome beach, and is about 50 feet from the kitchen to the water.  A couple of our group had stayed in the area numerous times, and they had never seen a palapa as large, nice, and close to the water as this place has.  Highly recommend for large groups.    Finally, there are a decent amount of baby stingrays in the shallows, so wear water socks and shuffle when you enter the water.  I stepped right on one the second day and he stabbed me to the bone in the top of my foot.  After a few hours of pain from the venom, I was pretty good the rest of the trip and did lots of snorkeling and scuba diving.  I think you are also paying for the basically unfettered access to Soliman Bay, and most of our group snorkeled daily, seeing LOTS of rays, sea turtles, and reef fish.  Would love to return next year.",50,437

"We had four families for a total of 19 guests (8 adults; and 11 children ranging from 4-16 years old).  There was more than enough space for us all, and we even had a couple of rooms unoccupied.  The set up is 4 bedrooms in the main house; one bedroom attached to the main house but only accessed through outside; and four garden casitas.  This served our needs very well but depending on the make-up of your group it might not be suitable for all.  If you have a lot of very young children to have their own rooms you may not be comfortable with them staying in a garden casita on their own.  We all preferred to have the youngest in rooms with parents anyways in the main house, so it was great to put them to bed and then be downstairs having adult time.

Fast forward a few hours later as we are leaving the same guy blocks my way asking if he can help me. He proceeds to rudely say ""There's no free beach access."" We asked him why he assumed we had just accessed the beach and not dined and he kept repeating there's no free beach access.  There's was other people  (Caucasian) walking in and out without being stopped. When we questioned him why he assumed we accessed the beach for free he",20,438
 responded by yelling out to his colleagues to call the police. The manager came to see what was happening and my husband demanded we get an apology from his Colleague that had singled us out. This experience was upsetting because not only did we eat and drink there but we also paid for parking and even rented beach towels at the same establishment. But more so at the fact that he stopped us and no one else which made us feel targeted.

"After 9 hours driving to Tulum we finally arrived to the camp, went with family and friends to the main office to do the check in where they saw our children and never said anything that they didn't allowed kids. First night we had problems with the AC that had to be changed and still we spent the night waking up every hour with a noisy sound that the AC was making.  Second day: breakfast was ready after 9 am (fruits, yogurt, granola, juice and coffee). After breakfast we went to the beach and were having a wonderful time with the kids. We were placing an umbrella for the kids because of the sun and the hotel manager approached to us and asked us to removed the umbrella cause it didn't go with the beach decoration and kindly brought us another tent (we understood his point).",20,440
" Then he told us that the camp was a kids free ""resort"" and he was going to check if he could do a transfer to give us the money back so we could leave the place (but for the next day because it was already too late to cancel the booking of that day). We were never told that kids were not allowed before the booking and we even whastapped the staff days before to asked them things about the camp and if we could bring certain things for the kids and requested to be together because we were a group of 3 families. They never said kids were not allowed...  Imagine, we are coming by car, 9 hours driving, and their brilliant idea was to tell us we could look for another place for the next days to stay. Where am I going to find rooms in a hotel in Tulum for a party of 12 one day before??? He also said that the next day they were having a party so they were going to place us in another side of the beach so we didn't disturb.  What kind of manager say all that to his customers? We really felt completely ignored and felt we were really bothering them. Have to say some of the staff were nice to us though. Third day: we had to stay in the camp because they couldn't refund us the money so we decided that the best thing to do was to leave to another beach with the kids and we came back to the camp after 10 pm when the  party was over.  Beside we had to stay because we had no other choice last night there was no electricity in the whole camp and there was no water for a while. For what we payed we expected much more than what we got. Prices are extremely high to stay on a camp with no water and electricity and lack of service. We wanted to stayed because of the experience of camping with the kids. The place is beautiful. The idea of the camp is amazing but they just don't know how to keep customers.   We wanted to go there because it was a super plan for the kids  but we didn't feel welcomed at all! And have to say the kids behaved very well so it was not fair to get treat like that. Another thing I need to mention is that the beach restaurant charged us more than we actually ordered. We checked the bill during the check out and they had to fixed it. To compensate the lack of water and electricity and uncomfortable last night we had the manager gave us a 50% discount on the beach restaurant bill. We lost a football and a pair of crocs as well. We couldn't find them inside the camp. Also I really wonder why we were able to book with kids on different websites which didn't specified that they are not allowed. I went to the camp website too to read about the place and never read that policy neither.",50,440

"For the rate I was prepared to pay, I was fully expecting a basic room and even perhaps sharing a bath. I was absolutely ecstatic when I was brought to my own beautiful private cabana with a private and clean bathroom. The cabin was so charming with a nice fan and net over the bed(although there were no bugs). No fancy useless stuff like TV's, one time use slippers or wet bars. You get clean towels, warm water, electricity all night along with WIFI, fresh drinking water brought to your room daily and a lovely, polite staff that clean daily. Julia, the manager, went out of her way to give detailed directions on how to get to sight seeing destinations, restaurants, and stores in town. I can't say enough about how professional, courteous, and helpful Julia was during my stay. I",50,442
" truly felt like I was at a posh boutique resort but paying a hostel price. The only drawback is that you MUST have a car to stay there. The road to the hotel from the main road is very rough and takes a long time to drive, let alone walk. If you plan on just staying there or not leaving in and out a lot, then you can get by without a car. But if you plan on going to the beach, restaurants etc, you'll need a vehicle. Unfortunately my phone was an hour off due to the time change so I missed my last dinner and was late for checkout. The staff was of course totally understanding of my error and allowed me to stay the extra time. To summarize - if you don't mind being away from the beach and have a vehicle, this is the best bet in Tulum by far!",50,442

"Oh wow, what a great place.  Just opened and doing everything that could to make sure we were happy.  The chef Carona was so fun.  He may have taken a long time to get the food to the table, but that was a new young chef wanting to make sure everything was perfect.  Julia the manager was just plain delightful.  Some may not enjoy the resident dogs, but we loved having them around.  Down a very bumpy dirt road and worth every bump.  Happy staff makes for a great stay",50,442

"A beautiful,  secluded spot in the middle of the forest 8 or so km from Tulum.  I had a wonderful time relaxing and exploring the beautiful beaches and amazing Mayan ruins around this area.  At the end of the day you can sit and relax at the pool right next to their own Cenote!!, and have a drink at the bar and chat with the friendly bartender.   The bungalows are nicely spaced apart from each other and comfortable.   Not for those who want to be staying on the beach with hordes of other people but for those who want easy access to this and then peace and quiet at the end of the day.  Service was great and I highly recommend this place to those who want something a little more quiter away from the hustle and bustle. ",50,442
Beautiful place -quite new with friendly staff and great concept.  Lovely grounds and plenty to do near by.  You do need a car to make the most of the location.  Rough road but worth it!  Will return! Great trip.,50,442
If it was not for this hotel I would have hate my last 2 days of vacation in Mexico. I would not recommend Tulum but I strongly recommend this place. It is an oasis in the jungle and the place for breakfast has a wonderful view on the cenote towards the raising sun. The road to go there is a bit rough but the hotel deserves the effort. The cabins have the roof made with leaves but with our big surprise are resistant to big storms!!! Wonderful!!  ,50,442
"El anfitrión ( Paco ) siempre disponible, atento y preocupado por la comodidad de sus huéspedes, te deja las cosas para que te hagas un buen café en la habitación por si te apetece, el sitio esta cuidado al más mínimo detalle.

"Our room was lovely, clean, and spacious. The bed was huge and comfortable. The grounds are small but meticulously kept, and there is a pool available to guests. I did not swim in it (because cenotes), but it looked lovely. The owner lives on the premises and is very concerned about safety, so the property is walled and accessible by a keyed gate. There is room for a few car inside the wall as well. The property is about 7 minutes outside of the main tourist area along the highway, and as a smaller woman, I wouldn't want to try walking there, especially in the dark, because there are few lights and the nearby neighborhood looks a bit sketchy. However, once on the property, it was great. The benefit of being away from town is the peace and quiet, which is worth a lot if you are a",50,444

We had already been travelling for a couple of weeks and had been eating out every morning. So having breakfast here on the balcony, watching the sunrise was amazing. The birds that come to get their morning treats put out by the owner was fun to watch as well. Also with the fridge you can keep beverages, beer, wine to enjoy at your leisure. We rented bikes to get around, available for rent from the owner. We used them every day for hours. Loved coming back to take a quick dip in the pool.

You can also pull out the the small patio table and chairs, as we did each morning to have breakfast. And again in the evening upon returning to enjoy a drink and snacks.  Great price for what you get. Very clean rooms, well maintained.  Our only issue was the neighbour behind the hotel, had a yippee dog...often barked most of the night. Not the fault of our hosts at all.  Very annoying. Tita too had a small dog...never said boo. Very quiet and well behaved. It is a bit far from everything, you either need a car or bikes are perfect.We opted for the bikes, rode all the way to the beach a couple of the days. Just over 7kms to the beach.  Overall, a lovely place to stay! Really enjoyed our time here.",40,444

"Stayed here for 3 weeks and Tita was a great host! The accommodations were clean and comfortable - A/C, fan, kitchen with fridge and hot plate, hot showers, speedy wifi. Loved the hammock on the patio and taking a dip in the pool. The only drawback to this spot is that it's quite a distance from the beach. But if you have a car or can afford taxis, it's not a big deal and worth it to have somewhere calm, safe and affordable to lay your head at the end of the day. Really enjoyed my stay!",50,444
"Recently refurbished room, nice enough bathroom and cute little courtyard with super tiny pool and few hammocks. Downside was owner not there when we arrived at 6'30pm. The keys were left in a box outside the main door. The bed sheet had a dirt mark but there was no one to talk to about. We only saw the owner at check out when he asked us fo 400 pesos for using the bicycles which were in the courtyard with no sign. There was written anywhere they were for rent. He also made us feel bad that he never saw us during the stay, well he was never there!  There are better hotels in the area near the pueblo. The La Posta is not even that close to the town to walk to.    Also for the 100 euros per night no one came to even do the bed or check we had toilet paper, which is normal for such",20,445

"La Posta! What a beautiful name! And an equally gorgeous place- La Posta is such a pleasant mix of the local Mayan culture (the helpful young Ismael who works there is full Mayan & speaks the Mayan language fluently with his family) along with the strong Argentinian culture (Humberto, one of the founders, brings his Argentinian spirit & energy to the place) and European tastefulness (Antonio, the owner, is technically American but he's got the classy style & culture of Europe and the whole world!). The combination of all these cool cultures has made for a beautiful place with gorgeous clean big bedrooms, a perfect outside sitting/patio area, and a sweet pool just the right size. The town is so close but at the same time, just far enough so that La Posta feels just a bit private,",50,445

BE WARNED this place is not as advertised! They advertise themselves as a hotel but it is really a hostel. The building has no front door or a receptionist/security so pretty much anyone can walk in at any time. The shared kitchen was in a disgusting state for the duration of our stay with an extremely foul smell coming from the fridge. The sheets for the bed had nasty stains on them -- I've attached 3 photos for 3 separate sets of sheets. On top of that our room was right next to the generator which would go off at 5am everyday and would keep us up. We've brought this up to the host who initially suggested we move to a different room which was frankly much smaller and had no windows. While the generator was eventually moved to a different location we've had enough of all the,10,446
 issues and asked for our money back for the duration of the stay. We even agreed to pay a penalty since technically the place has a no cancellation policy though I'd argue that given all the issues we faced we shouldn't have had to pay anything extra. The amount of money we ended up getting back in the end was far less than what the host originally agreed to refund us. Honestly you're better off staying elsewhere!,20,446
…,30,446
Staff were not friendly at all (specially the young guy). The hostel was really noisy during the night (after 11 pm) and staff did not do anything to solve this issue. Humidity inside of the room (I was in a double one) was extremely high leading to a disgusting smell and an uncomfortable sensation. The toilet in these rooms is not close with an obvious lack of privacy (your roommate will hear and smell everything from you...).,50,446
"I didn't love this place, but it was nice.  The social area is small and not very comfortable.  There's no where to go if you're a shy person, so you're basically forced to leave or lay in bed.  Kinda has a hippy stoner yoga vibe.",40,446
"I arrived late in the evening and they gave my double bedroom to someone else as they claimed Booking.com had issues that day (I believe them as I had a few issues already with the website in my 2 months journey so far...), so they set me up in a dorm alone with my own bathroom. It was a little disappointing to have a bunk bed instead of a double, especially after 12 hours on a bus; but the bed was excellent, best mattress in months! the room was cleaned daily and the staff was incredibly helpful. Especially Alan who let me leave my luggage and have a shower hours after my check out! I was very grateful for that, as I had a 20 hours bus ride afterwards. Also I got a discount for the inconvenience of the double booking, which can always put a smile on your face. The location is",30,446

When checkin they asked that we could pay the first night in cash, ATM is not that far but when retrieving money from the ATM there will be 12% charged. The prive for the first night was 550 dollar for the cabanas with ocean view so we stayed here 1 night and the next nights where in a room behind this one. They charged 410 dollar a night. After one night there where parties every day until 10:30pm we didn’t know nothing except when asking the staff.

Be sure to reserve you beach bed not once but twice because they have given in away two times to guest from outside the hotel, very strange when you pay this amount of money for a two star hotel.   There’s no isolation so you can hear neighbours talk until early in de morning, maybe that’s why the rooms have a speaker with ocean sound or jungle sound. The bathroom is ok but the water smells terrible and the rooms are very moised.  For some strange reason we still don’t get they said on the a evening that we would like an upgrade to the penthouse because the hotelmanager doesn’t want to sleep in a big room. Of course we said so that evening we packed our luggage to move the next morning. Suddenly the next day they told us that  they boss decide to sell the room to someone else? First of all we didn’t ask anything and then they promised us this ‘upgrade’ because their manager didn’t want to sleep in a big room and the next day they sold the room? Come’on don’t play this money game and be serious with your clients how pay a morning money.  I told the manager this differents times and asked that I could talk to the boss, she was to busy with laying on her own beach and refused to have a chat with me. So we left 2 nights earlier and booked a new hotel. And even when we told all this things at the reception the women in charges just say seated on her chair on 5m.

Paints  release toxic fumes for at least 24 hours after painting. 4) When we asked for a refund, staff was extreemly rude, by staff I mean the manager and Antonio the host.

There were so many great places to eat nearby! The Rincon ? (red taqueria at the corner) the Carbonchito- evening joint with tables on a patio and hombres shuffling plates of amazing assada and pork tacos,from the grill.A lively scene!. There are also a couple of good European-style cafes on the street as well as lots of shopping, more food and a bike rental just a couple of blocks from Aerolito. We really liked staying in town and riding our bikes to the beach and ruins and then being amidst the the food and people of the town. We also took a day trip with a friend that Ariane suggested. What a great day! We were given a tour of nearby Muyil ruins,boated across the Sian Kaan, floated down opal water canals amongst native birds and mangroves and ended up in a diving contest at a quiet cenote! Frank was our guide and extremely knowledgable of  Mayan culture and history as well as a really kind and fun guy to spend the day with. His love for the area and culture is obvious.

I would recommend it to young people on a budget, adventurers, eco-naturists, and explorers.  Some nights there might be noise, but that is because you are in a town.  There are wonderful, inexpensive restaurants in town.  You can get to the ruins and the beach with a short taxi or bike ride.  My tip for staying in a town in Mexico is the lavanderias.

She even suggested us a tour with her friend, which was customised to our interests. It was expensive but worth it for the experience. We had a cooked breakfast every morning, usually omelettes and tortillas home made that same morning.   However, as advertised, Aerolito is basic housing, not luxury.

"The nine or so kilometers of the Tulum strip is wonderfully devoid of corporate hotels and restaurants, but offers a very considerable range of options from basic and grungy (Camp Chavez) to elite and perfectionist (Encantada). My partner and I were not going to consider anything over $100 a night, let alone the $400+ options, and wouldn't have wanted an insular or elite setting anyhow. We spent one pleasant night at Kiras, which was very friendly but a bit pricey and not totally exciting. We then moved onto Xbalanque, having borrowed some bikes for the sake of exploring. It was just right for us. At 700 pesos per night ($50), their sweet and simple cabanas are quite reasonable for being almost on the beach (mind you, they do not have beach frontage, but accessing the beach is",50,449

The limited electricity and wifi (evenings only) was ideal for us, as we wanted some access but a good excuse to ignore our phones throughout the day. It reinforced the beautiful simplicity of the place. The cenote in the back was clean and refreshing, fun both for swimming and for kayaking (kayaks are included). Leo was an extremely friendly and thoughtful host, and we enjoyed sitting with the whole crew for a home cooked meal our first night. The cabanas do not lend themselves to maximum privacy, but with the shades down it was fine. For active people looking for sweet simplicity and a friendly atmosphere, along with clear, cool, natural water for swimming and rinsing off the salt and sand, this place is perfect, and a good bargain. We definitely plan to be back.",50,449

Then, if you want, you get the most amazing breakfast omelette made by the super friendly crew. You meet all kinds of nice people while cooking together at the community kitchen …. You are 2 minutes from the beach … I loved it there. You just have to go!",30,449

They make you feel like you all are one family.  Yes, the cabañas are simple but has all you need to feel real jungle lifestyle.

"We are Tulum junkies and had spent a little time at Xbalamque a couple of years ago when staying across the road. So this year when it came time to book, we decidied on Xbalamque knowing it would be near our favorite stretch of beach and would be more economical during the high tourist season for the week we intended to be there.  This is not the kind of place for the picky traveler who wants the comforts of home... it's not quite camping style, but close. It's well maintained and very clean most of the time. They have a maid come about 3 times a week and she's very thorough! The cabanas all come equiped with outlets that work once the generator comes on just before sunset and they provide a fan as well. We didn't need them, but travelers during summer months might appreciate",20,449
" them.   We used the kitchen for cooking with no probems and the community palapa is nice for reading and hanging out when you want to get out of the cabana or weather isn't great. We had a lot of rain during our stay. The cenote was greener and murkier than a few years ago, but that could be due to the unusual amount of rain they've been getting. It was still refreshing after our swims in the ocean just across the street through a brief passage.   I might avoid the cabana on the south end (side where kitchen, restrooms, and showers are) if you can... there was a sewage odor and it was muddy (may not always be the case as they had unusually heavy rain). The cabanas on the other side, however, have a deck leading to them or nicely graveled pathways and for whatever reason don't have the same issues with mosquitos. We started out there but moved to the cabana with two beds which accomodated our family much better. Trying to sleep without a mosquito net in the jungle during a downpour isn't ideal! Karla and Andrea were extremely helpful and accomodated as best they could.   The property dog, Tito, provided our kids with hours of entertainment. Karla and the other travelers were gracious and very sweet towards the children. One night there was a cenote rave or party going on, but you could avoid it... and people like to come to the property for small get togethers. This wasn't an issue for us, as kids were in bed by party time and it wasn't so loud it interfered with our sleep. I wouldn't recommend if you are on the conservative side, particularly parents who are bringing children.   Overall, we enjoyed our stay in the jungle. The weather presented us with challenges but that's of no fault of Xbalamque. The price and proximity to beach and cabanas are all high selling points.. but we've been too spoiled in the past staying on the beach and missed the sound of the ocean and the breeze far too much. We will always keep Xbalamque in mind if beachside doesn't work out for us in the future!",20,449
"I very much enjoyed my stay at Calm Cabins. Dora was a gracious host. The accommodation was clean and basic--exactly what one should expect for the price. The negative reviews are silly and seem to come from inexperienced travelers that think they're going to find luxury accommodations at bargain basement prices.  As you can see from the map, the location is just a block or so off the main drag, so convenient if you're using public transportation. I've rented a car both times I visited Tulum and was glad I did. It's easy to get around to the beaches, cenotes and sites.",50,450

Superb place and great people, ideal for relaxing your mind and body. They are super helpful too and gave us the best advice on bike rentals and local trips - highly recommended! Nice and neat. Plus the wifi worked super good.   11",50,450

These shacks are located 1km away from town in a noisy neighborhood. There is no AC, two outlets in the entire hut (one of which must be used for the fan if you don't want to sweat all night), the bed was filthy, the windows don't lock and are falling off the hinges. All night we heard gunshots and people screaming and banging on the gate. The ""mosquito net"" is nothing more than a thin sheet that doesn't go entirely around the bed with a huge slit in it. When we told Pierre about our issues, he simply told us that it's our problem, not his. I don't know how the main location looks, but",10,450
 this one is nothing but trouble.,50,450

"So we got really lucky finding Calm Cabins, we were due for a couples break from the hostel dorm rooms and found Dora who is the super nice and helpful owner of Calm Cabins! She has 2 places, one that she lives at with cabins and then another a few blocks away where we stayed! We were the only ones staying there in a nice cabin out back with a beautiful garden and little kitchen, there is also a pool but when we stayed it was off season so it was empty! This place was so nice and peaceful and is ideal if you just want to relax and have some quiet time!",10,450
"Dirty, old, expensive, 1st breakfast was poor, every animals could come in the rooms, no toilets paper, 6 people in a 5 people room.we were in Tulum to rest, and we were not able to sleep properly because matresses were not good quality. The only thing which worked was Wifi!",50,450
"My friend and I paid higher rates to stay here during the high season. This place is not worth the money they are asking for it.  We never actually met ""Dora"".  We met Irma.  The place looked nothing like the photos.  It's not even a cabin.  There were lizards and bugs all in the room.  There is no air conditioning and the place is advertised as having plenty of fans.  It had 1 ceiling fan that did not keep the room cool.  It was so miserable in there, we couldn't sleep.  The only thing decent about this stay was the breakfast.   If you don't care about staying in a ""dive"" then stay here, but if you want comfort and a place to relax after a day of site-seeing, this is not the place!",50,450
"we had a reservation at the calm cabins for four days and decided to extend our stay to 5! dora was delightful every day, and gave us great recommendations for cool places to go in and around tulum. each one was a big winner. she always let us know where she would be, and she was extremely flexible with our schedule. the place is beautiful, right on the edge of town. the road seems spooky but is actually always populated with families and people at all hours. breakfast each day was great, and because of the small number of people there, our stay was easy and homey and friendly. if you want a hotel experience, this place is not for you. if you want a friendly place to stay with a beautiful floral patio and rustic accomodations, you actually could not do better than calm cabins.",50,450
"Calm Cabins is just off the main drag, close to the bus station, and fairly basic.  We spent 6 nights there. Our room was clean and comfortable, spacious and well-fitted. The owner-host, Dora, serves breakfast in the open area in the compound; wholesome, filling and different every day.  Dora is a gem: she knows the area well and will give any help you request.  Go chill there.",50,450
"Incredible! Italian family superb! We've been like at home, they were waiting for us because we've arrived around 21:30 h, they offered us beberage for wellcome (some drinks) but we were so tired, on the day after, they prepared for us a splendid breakfast with fresh fruit, toast italian coffee, juices, even some eggs if we desired.   The room was the best, superclean and confortable! we were by car, it's a Little hidden in the sorrounders of Tulum, not in the city center, but we're looking for something quite! Perfect for relaxing, they have a swimming pool and a garden. Amazing!  Thanks a lot",50,451
"Casa Rosina is a new, pristine casa. Italian owners were very friendly and hosbitable. They offered us a ride to the city and delicious pastries. Room was very clean (note there is only fan) and wifi worked well. Breakfast was good (granola ++++).   Con about Casa Rosina is it's location - it is in the middle of nowhere. There is no proper roads to Casa Rosina yet. You have to either use  taxi and tell the driver where to drive, or cycle in daylight (Casa rosina has free good cycles to use). This was a major bummer to us, cause we like to eat out after daylight, even tough we really liked the place and especially the owners. We recommend to double check the location before you book - if you have your own car, then there is no problem.   Nearest restaurants are in new",40,451
"I went to la calma on a yoga retreat with my wife. I was a bit skeptic about going to Mexico with all of the recent media propganda. Boy was I wrong. First of all, the locals were EXCEPTIONALLY nice and friendly. Helps to speak some Spanish but our drivers were able to get us where we needed.    Now on la calma... wow.  David runs a fantastic service.  All of his staff were exceptional. The food was AMAZING (Teresa needs to create a cookbook to sell to her guests) and the amenities were very clean and kept clean.  Though it is in the middle of the jungle (we drove in at night and it was a bit if a question mark at that time) we felt very safe the entire trip. The ONLY reason I am not giving my review 5 stars is because there is absolutely no air movement in the rooms at all. ",40,452
" Just a simple camping fan would have been a major plus. We spoke with David about this.  Being completely off-grid, the technology is just not there for energy efficient fans... yet.  He discussed this in detail about bringing in Tesla batteries but that is in the future.  Great place, great food, great times. ",50,452
…,50,452
"La Calma is a sweet and quiet jungle retreat. In the commune area off the Dos Ojos access road, the location is convenient to Sian Kaan Biosphere, Tulum, Akumal, and surrounding areas. The accommodations are simple and clean. The food is all scratch-made and nutritious... and can be catered to fit the needs a given crowd. The staff of four is all Czech, and I personally liked all of them. Please note this retreat is totally off the grid in terms of entertainment (and that is a good thing)... no WiFi, land lines, or TV. If you don't a cell service, you'll need to go into a nearby town to get it. Perhaps guests can start leaving books behind or boards games behind? That would be about all you would need. The two housing buildings are shaped like this ""[ X ]"". The brackets are the",50,452
" buildings shape as seen from above and the X is the common area and dining palapa structure in between. There are a few hammocks and seats for relaxing there, as well as the main dining table and serving table. The yoga palapa is fabulous... in the jungle. The Dos Ojos cenote is an easy walk away, and the larger ""second eye"" is huge and a joy to explore with a mask and snorkel.",50,452
…,50,452
"This place was very nice, and I loved the food, the dogs, and the atmosphere.  There are bugs, you are in the jungle, but there was an ample supply of bug spray, and mosquito nets... thank you!  Food was Delicious, made fresh everyday, and healthy.  Drivers were friendly and so accommodating ! Staff at La Calma were by far, some of the best I have ever dealt with. If you love animals, you will fall in love with them here!  A solar powered fan, on those occasional, VERY hot nights would have been nice, was the only downfall.  ",40,452
"We came here on our  Tulum adventure and I just can't say enough . This place is close but hidden , you can walk 15 minutes to an amazing cenote , the rooms are gorgeous and big , we had our meals cooked for us and they were so good , all fresh , local , tasty . We had yoga in the palapa looking the jungle and hearing the birds, catching glimpses of other animals , we had massages. It was good after a day of adventure to come here and just relax .No wifi or cell service which I see it as good, time to talk with your friends , read a good book and disconnect . Thank you La Calma and their beautiful people who runs it , we miss Bertha and Figo .(the dogs )",50,452
"We absolutely loved our time at La Calma over New Years 2015/2016. The rooms were very cute, the setting beautiful, and the team couldn't have been better. David's recommendations of what to see and do each day were spot on - we discovered some exceptionally beautiful spots from his advice. Lucy and Svatka were really lovely too - so warm and welcoming and the food they whipped up each morning and evening was delicious, fresh, and healthy with a Mexican flair. I highly recommend booking La Calma! Go for the room with the hanging bed :)",50,452
"La Calma is a great eco-lodge if you're looking for something quaint and simple, but most importantly, if you want to disconnect from the digital world in order to connect with the natural one. This was what I was looking to do in Mexico for two weeks, so this was exactly what I needed. La Calma is typically used for yoga retreats, so the energy is positive and relaxing where you can really spend time reflecting, re-energizing and refocusing your thoughts.. You wake up to a healthy organic breakfast made by the lovely ladies Svetka and Lucie, and sleep at the euphonious sound of the jungle.. Also, love the fact that this is run by a sweet family (Ahoj Tomas  a Annette!) who are awesome hosts and cares about your overall well-being.. Oh, and the dogs who are always ready to greet",50,452
"To be sincere I didn't like the experience: I think it was dirty the tent, the toilet and overall over the place. The place needs to renovate and freshen up. It's expensive and the towels is not included in the price. It's called ""glamping"", in others words ""glamorous camping"" and I didn't feel that at all....  To charge your phone from your tent is available from 07 pm to 12 pm. Also the wi-fi is available at that time.  I could also hear the personal arguing with each other several times which also made it further a negative energy. The owner of the place is really nice to talk to but that isn't enough to give it a good rate... ",20,453
"We spent a night here with our campervan & had a great time! Galia was a super host, a very warm and welcoming person and we had great chats with her over breakfast. The kitchen is well stocked and the bathrooms clean - we particularly loved the showers. You can rent kayaks and go out on the cenote which is cool. If you get too hot they will also rent you a fan for the night time. If you like a laid back vibe in the middle of nature - this is for you. It’s somewhere very different to stay in tulum and a cool experience. ",50,453
"Whenever I go to Tulum, this is the only place I stay. It is simply magical. I love the people and the vibe. The cenote in the back is literally the ultimate swimming hole, crystal clear and refreshing. No matter how rough the ocean is, or how much seaweed there is, I always have a perfect place to swim. The campground is located past all of the development and noise, and is a true enclave of peace. At night, all I hear is the sound of the wind in the palms, and the distant roar of the ocean. The stars blaze above the trees in the darkness.   The campground is super clean and well kept. The tents are already set up, with comfy mattresses and electricity at night. The new outdoor bathroom/showers is simply gorgeous. Brushing my teeth at night at the outdoor sink, or showering",50,453
" with a palm tree growing right through the stall- is simply a delight.   Galia and Martin who run the campground are so lovely, and have become my friends. They are special people, kind and gentle, who go out of their way to be welcoming and helpful. Whomever is staying at the campground becomes part of a family of the moment. The communal kitchen is fully equipped and cozy; a great place to hang out and meet others.  Highly recommend renting a bicycle to ride down the beach road to the fancy resorts and restaurants, and then return to the peaceful oasis of Cenote Encantado at night. An oasis is what it truly is.   If you're looking for luxury and fanciness, this is not your place. It is a campground after all. However, it's a fabulous, clean, quiet, comfortable, cozy, friendly, peaceful campground located on a beautiful cenote, at the quietest end of the beach road. For me it has become a home away from home, a refuge, and I'll always love it and return to it.",40,453
…,40,453
We stayed at another location and visited the Cenote. We got there very early in the morning. Martin let us in and provided life vests. The water was refreshing and the price reasonable. It would have been nice if there was a stable dock with steps as it was difficult for one of our older friend to safely get into the water.,20,453
"Galia, the owner, is a really gentle and nice person, interesting and outgoingly hospitable. Her manager, Martin, was also nice and helpful.  Galia gave us a tour and was very available for anything we needed.  The campground is ""encantado,"" with artsy sign, lovely little pathways with red and blue crabs scuttling down their holes, lizards, very adequate and weather-protected tents, a great kitchen and multiple fine bathroom facilities.  The yoga room is a well-equipped, spacious and nice place, a welcome respite from the mosquitoes.  The cenote is lovely, although you must enter the water quickly to avoid mosquitoes.  It does look a bit like a large lake surrounded by mangroves, and Galia has life vests and a couple of boats available for use, although we simply enjoyed",50,453
" swimming.  The cost seemed a little high for what it is, but I think the management is sincere, cares for guests and the environment, and has something special to offer.  We went in the hot season (early July) and part of my family was too hot to sleep in the still, hot air of the tent, also frustrated because the environment there naturally hosts lots of mosquitoes, which bit our kid a lot.  I would recommend this special place heartily as long as one knows to expect mosquitoes and is prepared to sleep in hot, still air... tho this may be different in other seasons.",10,453
…,30,453
"We visited the cenote only of this place and after visiting several ones in Tulum this one was the most deceiving. It was refreshing to swim in, but it really looks like a small lake. There is some decks all around with people drinking and camping which is fine if it's your thing but it was definitely not the nature experience I was expecting, more a place where people go to party.",50,453
"Recently we (two couples) spent a wonderful 10 days at Rancho San Eric, Casa Colibri-not Casa Blanca.  Casa Colibri is a lovely two bedroom/two bath casita just steps from the Caribbean and is just one of the several individual accommodations that comprise Rancho San Eric.  We loved the location which is on the south end of the busy hotel and beach strip about 10kms. from Tulum Pueblo.  Rancho San Eric remains  a quite, tranquil oasis secluded from the chaos, the hyper development and non stop party scene that has transformed Tulum in recent years.  Here you can relax on your private deck, swim in the clean waters of the sea, walk towards the south on miles of nearly deserted white sand beach,  or enjoy a refreshing dip in the pool.  We also liked using the small but well",50,454
" equipped kitchen in Casa Colibri which is ideal for self catering.  The management of RSE offers a food shopping/provisioning service for a small fee so that when you arrive your fridge will be stocked with whatever items you desire.  Communication with the the owners is easy and fast.  The staff on site is there to provide you with friendly and helpful service.  For those who want a taste of beautiful Tulum as it used to be, I can only give RSE my highest recommendation.  I hope that we will be able to make a return visit in the near future.",50,454
…,50,454
"Wow wow wow! From owner to staff to location to home, everything was absolutely perfect! Close to all, located on the beach, across the street from cenotes, Mayan Laguna, restaurants and more. Was able to jog, kiteboard, walks on the beach, lay by pool and/or beach. Highly recommended. Absolutely coming back. Thank you to the entire rancho san Eric family!",40,454
"Without a doubt, one of our most favorite places to stay in the world, if not THE most. We plan on being back many more times. And we hope to be honored to stay at Rancho San Eric every time. You will not believe how gorgeous their property is, each place positioned to make the most of the beach. We slept nightly with the waves crashing just at the bottom of the steps to our own area of the sand.   These are quite minimalist offerings if you are used to Villas or resorts. But what they lack in accommodations, they more than make for in setting and privacy. You are essentially renting your own home, but one that has its private access to the beach and a wall of windows facing the Caribbean. It was heaven. Our house had pots/pans, towels, a fridge, hot water, purified water, and",50,454
" comfortable beds. The furniture was not very comfortable inside, but you can imagine why.  The patio area was gorgeous outside.   You will not find much more than that though. We were used to private villas that offered at least some condiments, salt/pepper, sugar, etc upon arrival. So the result is that for that sort of stuff, we ended up having to buy things we will use for three to six days and then throw away? Seemed odd. And the property doesn't have bike rentals, or run their own tours, or have room service, TVs, or even a cafe on the property. So do not come expecting those. And our house didn't have an oven, which makes heating up things or cooking a bit difficult, particularly since we enjoy cooking and not having to eat out every single night. Though, honestly, the food in Tulum is so good, we quite enjoyed it. Just be sure you plan for that financially.   I have to agree with another reviewer that while the sounds of birds singing was nice; it felt really odd to have caged birds on the property. Made us feel a bit sad every time we walked by them. On the other hand, I know nothing about birds. Just felt odd since all these other birds were around them flying around freely.   Also, if you're coming expecting WiFi to be something you need for streaming movies or to get work done, please keep in mind that the wifi here works in a couple rooms and we had difficulty streaming music (Spotify) much less full movies or TV shows. I think that's probably just part of being on the beach. I'm not complaining as much as warning future guests to keep those expectations minimal. And if you're thinking private adult, quiet, resort, keep in mind that it depends on who else is renting homes. I like the sounds of dogs and kids playing; but if your idea of a vacation is pure peace and quiet, you might want to keep in mind that they have a pool and large gorgeous grounds here and some guests might have kids playing around. For us, it was nice to hear other people. At other times when we wanted to nap, we had dogs barking at remote control cars. Not a big deal though.   The staff on the property were awesome. The guys we talked with were very friendly and so very helpful. Hui was quick to respond to our emails from before booking all the way through our stay. They were very patient with us as we figured out how best to wire money, or to help us find places to eat, etc. Really, they were as great as any property owners/management we have ever worked with around the world. We are very thankful that they were so communicative and casual, as if we had worked with them for years.   Overall, we loved this place. My review details are honestly not meant to be negative, but simply alert future visitors about what to expect in terms of cooking, wifi, services. It bears repeating: the place is gorgeous and we would 100% stay here again and again even considering the above little things. If you are thinking about getting your own place (rather than a hotel/resort), then you would most likely LOVE Ranco San Eric.",50,454
…,50,454
"We stayed in Casa Calibri which is a rustic two bedroom apartment. There is great access to the beach, it is just beyond from the main hotel strip and therefore nice and quiet and the staff are wonderful. The only reasons for not giving the full five starts was that, whist not wanting it to have the facade of a McDonalds till, the outdoors area could have done with some more lighting for evenings. Secondly, both us and our neighbours agreed that the caged birds are a bit ‘80’s and is quite distressing to see amongst the all the rich wildlife surrounding them. ",50,454
"Stayed at Casa Dunia last month with a group of friends. The villa is gorgeous, comfortable, well maintained, very clean and in a beautifully tranquil setting with a private beach. Nothing was too much for the owner and staff, who were incredibly helpful. We had breakfast cooked every day and two dinners over the week, and the food was superb. A great stay - highly recommended.",50,454
"My first time in Tulum was in 1992, when I used to live in Mexico City.  Of course Tulum was MUCH different from now, it was an untouched pristine gorgeous beach with very few basic places to stay. I went back a few times in the 90s, until I moved to New York. After a hiatus of about 12 years, I went back to Tulum with my partner in 2009. It had already started to change, many new hotels and tourism infrastructure had developed since, but remained a wonderful place. We have been back every year from 2009 and it's a little shock each time to see how it changes and ""develops"", but Rancho San Eric is our point of reference for that special feeling that Tulum had years ago. This time (May 2017) we rented both Perico and Buho because my sister from Italy joined us. She had the studio",50,454
"Had such a good experience at this hostel — the staff was lovely. The ambiance was peaceful and gave you the feeling of being secluded in the jungle of tulum while still being close to everything —Town is a short 10 minute walk.  Rooms are clean! Nice kitchen and beautiful garden common area with pool , tables and hammocks. ",50,455
"I was amazed by the beautiful and unique common area in this hostel. The photos looked nice, but while standing on the other side of the gate awaiting staff to open for check-in, I did not expect it to be this cool and unique. I don't often stay in a private either, as I love dorm-style, but this was the perfect experience to do so. Excellently crafted rooms, with a great balance of rustic & modern.  Javier was phenomenal! Such great hospitality and very accommodating to all of our requests. Loved his friendliness and smiles (and the wonderful woman who made us breakfast!)--I rarely visit the same hostel twice, and would certainly return here!!",50,455
Beautiful the external part and the garden where you can meet the other guests or just chill out. Staff really nice but no proposal of activity in there. Really open minded you can cook or prepare your cocktails in every moment. Bikes for rental is a good deal. Only complain one bathroom for all the dorms. Great position to discover Tulum. Alice & Damona,40,455
"Me and my partner stayed here for 4 nights. Was great, cheap accom for Tulum just off the main road. Staff were very friendly and the outside area is awesome to chill in hammocks with a beer and free breakfast and bike borrow was such a good bonus! Only downside was that the rooms were very noisy.",40,455
we stayed 2 nights here and completely enjoyed our time. the property and home are beautiful and the staff are so kind and helpful. this is a great place to stay if you're looking for a chill atmosphere.,50,455
"Stayed at this hostel for 2 nights in Tulum. It was beautiful and so relaxing. Carlos was really helpful as was Vicky who came to make breakfast! The outdoor area with pool and hammocks was amazing, pictures honestly can’t do it justice. We were in a girls only shared dorm which was nice, it said AC but it was just fans - was fine because the weather was cooler but something to bear in mind if you struggle to sleep in heat! Dorms without a bathroom use one shared or the outdoor bathrooms and showers, which are nice but watch out for mosquitoes! Recently just finished building work on some private rooms that from the outside look unreal. Definitely would stay again and recommend it to anyone wanting to see Tulum but wanting a little serenity at the same time!",40,455
"So nice hostel with beautiful outdoor place , nice location only 5-10 minutes from the centre of tulum .Nice owners and so communicative.. You feel like you are in a camping with good friends Thanks a lot for your hospitality",50,455
"The staff is so nice and helpful, they were super kind with us. The outdoors and shared areas are cozy and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent. It is a bit far from everything, so it is not the best location to arrive late at night.",40,455
"I was super happy to have found this place by coincidence. finally i spend two weeks there. Sara is a warmhearted and funny person, who makes you feel comfortable and at home from the beginning on. also her daughter nelly always cares for you. we had a good time with a lot of laughter and some baile and meszcal and i met lovely people there:))!  I especially like the big garden, the outside showers and bathrooms and the hammock at the balcony. the hostel is a litte off from the center (but still walkable) which i personally prefer; its quite and sourround by local people houses. breakfast is nice, sometimes with some little extra dish from saras mexican kitchen....:) que padres - muchas gracias!",50,455
"definitely the most similar place to be at home in the Tulum paradise. You can move anywhere easily, the environment is super relaxed and the owner's attention is incredible.   If your plan is to have a good time and live a pleasant experience, La Negrita is the right place   ",50,455
My cousin and I had a good time here. The staff is amazing and they go out there way to make sure you are okay. The dorms were kept clean. It’s a bit far from downtown but if you have a car or don’t mind taking the local shuttle this is a great place with the right price.,50,456
"The Hostel is the best, really comfy, and clean, the showers are amazing and Gabriela in the front desk is an absolute angel.  Thank you for everything i hope i can come back soon   Really recommended....",50,456
Modern and clean! Everything is brand new. We stayed 2 nights. Beautiful pool and very comfortable beds! Fast Internet provided. The owner (Sandro) will help you with everything you need! It's best if you have a car to go out for lunch or dinner. Free parking in front of hotel. Continental breakfast included was good. We recommend!,50,456
"We enjoyed staying at this lovely property right next to the sea.  Very quiet setting.  They have a nice palapa with hammocks to relax in.  We stayed in the Tikal room which directly faced the ocean with beautiful views right from the bed.  Breakfast included which made a great way to start the day.  There is a cenote just a few minutes walk down the road as well as two restaurants so we often found ourselves there dining on the sand at the end of the day since it was just a stroll to get there.  Close to town, we had a rental car so just about a 5 minute drive to the market in Tulum.  The ocean here is rocky so bring water shoes.",50,457
"We stayed at the Tankah Inn for 10 nights, 2/26 - 3/8/18.  We stayed in the Tikal room, and were pleasantly surprised at the incredible view. The windows face east, and you get to wake up to an incredibly beautiful sunrise over the caribbean, which is totally visible right from your bed. None of the other rooms have a view this spectacular. The first 6-7 nights of our stay, we had the beach virtually to ourselves.  The solitude was wonderful. We felt so safe and alone, that we slept with our windows open every night, listening to the ocean, and enjoying the cool caribbean breeze. We ate breakfast here everyday, and the food is good. You can get a bowl of fresh fruit with granola and yogurt, eggs, pancakes, bacon etc and they make 3 mexican egg dishes.  The bed was comfortable,",40,457
" the room was clean and adequate, and the view was as good as it gets. It is a 5 minute walk to a fabulous cenote. They charge 120 pesos per person ($6). Get there early to snorkel and beat the crowds.  There is a sandy beach, but access to the water is very difficult due to the rocks.  Kids would not be able to play in the water here. It is a good long walk either north or south to get away from the rocks. There is some decent snorkeling, but you have to go way out to get to the reef.  I did it once, but it was a struggle walking over all the rocks, I wore water shoes instead of flippers. The only beach amenities are 3 outdated kayaks that weigh about 100 pounds each, and have no back support. It is difficult to drag them to the water. I recommended to the staff that they invest in some modern lightweight kayaks, so maybe they will. All they would need to do is put an anchor in the kayaks, and it would be much easier to get out to the  reef and snorkel. Paddle boards would be a nice addition also.  For swimming, there is a nice little area to the south, past the first big resort, which is a good hike.  Tulum is only 15 minutes to the south.  There is a grocery and bank right as you enter town on the right. Its right at the turn to Coba.  The room has a mini fridge so you can buy some snacks, water, and beer at the grocery.  There is a restaurant next to the cenote, called Casa Cenote, but the food is terrible. Good place for a cheap beer though. There is a ton of beach clubs and activities in the area.  Highly recommend renting a car. We rented one in Canun, called Avant, and it was an easy and good experience.  Driving hwy 307 is a breeze once you get used to the driving habits of the locals. We are in our sixties, so don't be afraid to rent a car. Get the Fodor's book on the Riviera Maya and you will find all kinds of fun things to do in the area. I would recommend a stay at the Tankah Inn.  If you are lucky, you'll get the Tikal room, and will have the place to yourself like we did.  One final note, the seagrass was terrible this year all along the coast from Cancun to Tulum.  It is so thick, most of the smaller places can't keep up with removing it, and it starts to smell like rotten eggs and fish. Someone said it is an unusually bad year for seagrass.",50,457

"We stayed for 5 days with Willy and the bunch. Every morning Pancho cooked a great breakfast, the sauces were out of this world. Willy and Victor did a great job setting us up with tours and restaurants in town. Don't worry if you still have questions from one of the tours you went on catch Willy at breakfast the next morning and he can fill in the details.   The beach here is spectacular, I imagine it is what having a private beach feels like. There isn't much traffic, but if you want to live a little there is a bar a short walk down the beach.   I would recommend a rental car, as it is a short ways from town.   Overall, 10/10 would do again.   Highly recommend renting a car.",50,457
"We stayed in a private property nearby but had breakfast here twice. It's a small kitchen- a one man operation mostly, but has a nice outdoor seating with a view of the bay or indoor if you prefer. This place is a good value and the breakfasts were great, except for the fruit salad which was a little disappointing. In their defense, it seemed a slower time and there were never more than three tables being served at once when we were eating. Hard to plan for such a small group. They have books to borrow left by other travelers and games for a rainy day. Breakfast was an excellent value. They only accept pesos.",40,457
"We were unable to book a room anywhere on Tulum beach and were pleasantly surprised by our time at the Tankah Inn.  It is small and cozy with minimalist rooms and a nice beach.  We headed the advice of other reviewers and brought water shoes to go swimming at the beach out front.  The hotel let us borrow fins we used to go snorkeling further down the beach.  Breakfast was delicious and filling every morning.  The road and beach is fairly quiet, with just a few bars and restaurants.  We made friends with another couple staying at the hotel and rung in the new year with them, drinking champagne on the beach.  It was a relaxing and low key vacation - just what we needed!",50,457
"this is a quiet place with 5 rooms.   fortunately not a party beach, two  restaurants near. the hotel is clean and the breakfast was tasty and filling. ( huevos rancheros, omelets etc).  the hotel has kayaks. the water has rocks but you can walk a bit further for a clearer entrance or take a kayak, it is very shallow.",50,457
"We stayed for 1 week here. We were looking to get away from the busy feel of Tulum beach. This was a perfect find for us! Might be TOO quiet for some! It is the best affordable place I found on the beach. Nothing fancy but clean, quiet, very friendly staff, large rooms (all with ocean views). Started the day with a great breakfast sitting on the upstairs patio over the beach. We used the free kayaks very day to explore the coast and to paddle out to the reef and snorkel. Took LONG walks to the south. The entry into the water at the hotel isn't great  but walking down the beach a ways it is fine. We kayaked to a perfect sandy deserted area and hung out for a few hours. We usually use public transportation but rented a car this time because it is a 1 km road to the hotel. Too hot",50,457
 to walk back and forth to the highway! A nice cenote about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. And a few restaurants there also!,50,457
"The place is simply a little gem in the overcrowded village. The staff is helpful, breakfast is decent and the rooms are spacious, clean, bright. It is completely worth the price. Moreover, the bikes are in good state I would definitely return.",50,458
"We spent 3 nights at this hotel. Was excellent. The rooms are super clean, the breakfast is great with lots of fruit. Good A-C. Poolarea is nice to spent Some time when its hot. The hosts are great and very willing to tell you everything about the tulum Area. They have bikes for rent. Location is really good. Loved our stay at the art hotel!",50,458
"If you plan to stay in town, I cannot think of a better place! I spent 4 nights here and didn't want to leave. The hotel is centrally located and about a 4 minute walk to a bank, Batey, Kay Nah, Matcha Mama, and Yoga Dicha.  The pool/garden area is beautiful and there's lot of cool art work around. An ample breakfast of fresh fruit, coffee/tea, orange juice, and toast is served each morning. The rooms are big, clean, and comfortable with both an AC unit and ceiling fan.  But the hospitality is what really makes Art Hotel stand out. After I commented on how much I liked the alegria that was served with breakfast, the manager gifted me my own pack of the grain snack to take back home with me! :) I loved my stay and plan to return very soon.  Tips: - No telephone or television in",50,458
" the room. Wifi in the room is very strong, so neither were missed. - If you need an iron, ask the front desk and they'll get one for you. - The entrance is on Satelite. Go to the larger gate and you'll see a door bell. - There are a lot of dogs in the area, so if you're afraid of dogs or bothered by barking, the area may not be for you. - There's a lot of construction in the area. Bring sneakers as some nearby streets are dug up and rocky. Again, the area, not the hotel.",50,458

"Small, warm and friendly! The staff go out of their way to help you with anything you need, water, towels, directions and aim to please. Our room was overlooking the main street with a lovely large balcony. It can be a bit noisy, but isn't anything you can't sleep through. The pool was clean and lovely to swim in anytime of the day. The artwork was cool and very Tulum. We found the experience better for having stayed here.",50,458
"We spent 6 nights here and had a very relaxing, enjoyable stay. The room was clean and comfortable, and the garden area is beautiful - the pool is small but perfect for a refreshing dip. The staff were friendly and always around to offer chilled water and clean towels for the pool area. Location is good, just 3 short blocks from the main road through Tulum, but very quiet. Bike rental is reasonably priced and convenient, and all the places we were given breakfast vouchers for were great (Ki'bok, Batey and Liquido y Solido). Would definitely stay here again.",50,458
"We stayed there for 6 days and I have to say that it was the most relaxing, cool and amazing hotel I've ever stayed in my life. All the staff was amazing and friendly. The room was exactly as booked. We fell in love with the yard of course. most of our nights we spend there just lying in the hammock reading and talking. It was all the vibe of the hotel that was relaxing and nice. The room was clean as well as the pool and every space in the hotel.   We had 3 options for breakfast which were all really close and amazing. The hotel is located really close to the main street, 3 minutes walk if I am not mistaken. All the bars, restaurants and the heartbeat of Tulum is right there, but at the same time it is quiet and cozy.  I would definitely recommend it and if I visit again Tulum",50,458

"Superb hostel: the rooms are clean and nice / the atmosphere is very warm and easy to meet / the location is top notch near all transport, restaurants and shops / and the owners are lovely.  Excellent value.  Only downside: provide only a blanket but no sheets.",50,459
This is the hidden gem of tulum. The better marketed hostels actually suck. Sergio and Sabrina and the coolest staff ever and they all treat us like family. Kitchen is great. Netflix and super comfy. Love Lum x,50,459
"Stayed there one night. Came in without reservation and was warmly welcomed by a french couple and the volunteers.  The hostel is kept tidy, 10min after I showered, someone was already cleaning the bathroom I used. Same for the room, really clean sheets, pillows, comfy mattresses, but reduced spaces. Only 6 beds per dorm. AC works good.  Atmosphere intimate, relaxed. They have all the amenities like being at home, with a great open kitchen, 3 chilling areas, one with sofa, tv, and a bookshelf with boardgames and more. Free bikes too.   Compared to other hostels in Tulum, this one is highly recommendable for smooth stays, not for partying, yet you are invited to socialize.  And well, it's 2 blocks away from the townhall.  Lovely 3 months old kitten and Dalmi the dog :)   Hope to",50,459

"I had such a blast in Lum Hostel, highly recommended!  The hostel has a great location, only a short walk away from the nightlife hot spots and good restaurants. They offer free bikes which allows you to have a nice bike ride with your new friends to the most beautiful beaches. Lum's staff is great and very knowledgable. They explained and showed us everything we needed and took us onto some bar crawls and night.  Amazing showers too!",50,459
"This is definitely the best hostel in Tulum! I loved everything about it. The decor and the building is nice, the common areas are great for socializing, the rooms and beds are comfortable and clean. The Aircon works very well! The staff is amazing and ensures that you have great stay. Perfect for solo travellers. They have activities you can join and free bikes to use.  Don't look any further, just book it! ",50,459
"Lum is the perfect hostel to get a taste of downtown Tulum. Everything in town is walkable including the bus station to get you to and from the airport. The hostel is very cozy, rooms are very clean and secure. Bike rentals are included for slightly further destinations like some ruins, cenotes, and the ocean. The staff is super helpful with anything. I would definitely stay here again and almost enjoyed my stay at Lum more than my stay on the water. Note- if you want to just lay on a beach all day, stay closer to the water. But if you want to be in town, and experience a little more culture, Lum cannot be beat.",50,459
"I stayed in Lum Hostal for two nights and wish I stayed there longer. Such a cool space with great decor, comfortable beds and extremely clean. Everything was perfect but the best part of the hostel was the personnel and the amenities. I loved the volunteers, you could tell they cared so much about the place and gave 100% to the guests. This says a lot about how great the management is!!! They have free activities everyday and that allows you to meet other travelers super quickly. The bikes are also included, so it’s super easy way to get to know all of Tulum.   Honestly one of the best hostels I have ever been and can’t wait to be back.",50,459

"Awesome location, quiet, tranquil and secluded! The breakfasts were out of this world! Each morning we were greeted with a huge selection of fruits, yogurt, granola, hot coffee and cream. That was just the warm up for the main course, which was totally different each day. I personally loved the eggs and chorizo and the fresh radishes and pico. And not to mention a pitcher full of the sweetest orange juice (freshly squeezed each morning) you’ll ever drink. If you’re lucky, sweet Peggy (grounds security) will grace you at breakfast and place her head on your leg with those big puppy eyes looking for a treat.  The room was fantastic, plenty big enough with cool breezes at night and a wonderful shower and balcony! The refrigerator had bottled water and a few soft drinks available",50,460
" when we arrived.  Comfortable bath robes were provided as well.  There is no TV in the room (don't need one, you're not there to watch TV).  Wifi worked great, no issues streaming music or sending messages.  The rooftop was great for relaxing, napping and a view of the ocean. Pool area is cozy and secluded, perfect for refreshing after being in the hot sun.  The hosts were very gracious and provided options for things to do around the area. If you’re looking for a spot to do nothing but unwind and relax, you’ve found your spot. I can’t recall a vacation spot where we felt as relaxed as we did here. A true hidden gem!",50,460

"This place is everything advertised and more!  Breakfast was gourmet every morning by the professional chef Jacqueline. Best coffee in town!   It is tucked away from town and crowds but not too far that anywhere you wanted to go was a short trip in the car.  The beach is there for walks in am and pm and restaurants/beach bars are within walking distance if you just want to hide out and not get in a car.There is scuba down the road as well.  The roof has a amazing view along with being a nice place to relax in the jacuzzi, read a book or take a nap.  Casa Jacqueline is so inviting with its atmosphere.  I would definitely put it in my plans to visit Tulum again.  If you don't want a big resort or the crowds/cars/noise of town stay here!!!",50,460
"Christmas week spent at Casa Jacqueline was the exact experience my husband and I were looking for. Tucked away down a quiet dirt road across from the beach and about 4 miles from Tulum center. You will want a car.  If you are more of an all inclusive, every luxury mega resort kind of person, this would not be for you. But it was the perfect spot to head out exploring the Mayan ruins at Tulum, Coba and Muyil. It was the perfect spot for visiting birding and wildlife parks at Si'an Kaan and Punta Laguna.  We saw kiskadees and  other tropical birds while having breakfast on Casa Jacqueline's back patio. We saw three coatamundis within a few blocks and walked to the crystal clear cenote down the road. We enjoyed walks on the somewhat rocky beach.   Breakfast was prepared with care",50,460
" and talent by Jackie. Each morning started with fresh fruit and coffee followed by something exceptionally delicious.  Jackie was also happy to share ideas on things to do or restaurants.  A fun and charming hostess.  We loved the deck overlooking a pretty blue tiled pool and generous size of the red room.  The roof deck was the perfect spot for a glass of wine at sunset one evening.  Casa Jacqueline is a colorful, charming bit of tropical paradise.",50,460

We stayed here for 3 nights earlier this week and it was a lovely stay!  Simple rooms but very clean with comfortable beds and a good shower (hot water and good pressure).   The free bikes are a major perk though be advised many visitors lock them the night before to hold the best bikes for themselves so you might want to do the same.  The breakfast is simple but the kitchen is communal which we took full advantage of.  The location is great - close to everything but not in the middle of it so no noise issues   And the staff is wonderful - Susanna was great and helped us with everything we could possibly need (including a hot shower after we got caught in the rain post checkout)  It may seem expensive for what you get but tulum is expensive so ultimately I think it’s a pretty,40,461

"Me and my friend spent 3 night here in January, and everything was perfect. The room with AC and wifi, the breakfast and most of all the owner Lourdes who is the heart and soul of Villa Matisse. She is very nice and friendly... always ready to help you. Villa Matisse is also in a very good location. Recommended!",50,461
"Lourdes is an excellent host and I loved the coziness to the place.  Conveniently located on a side street off the main drag, you're within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and convenience stores but far from the insanely loud music.  The room itself was spacious and clean but there is no AC or TV.  There was always hot water in the shower and plenty of space for your belongings.  There is also a communal kitchen available for personal use and it was always very, very clean.",50,461
"This was my second time staying at Villa Matisse, on a cave diving holiday. Lourdes, the owner, is very friendly and helpful The rooms are clean, with ceiling and pedestal fans and a shower. There is wifi and a nice breakfast. There is a central fridge where you can store your own stuff. Restaurants are close by and so is the supermarket. Tulum is the centre of ""cave Mecca"". Xibalba, the dive school, is  close by, so it is easy to get your tanks for a day diving (if you are a certified cave diver).",50,461
"Owner Lourdes is the heart and soul of Villa Matisse. Lovely little hotel in the town of Tulum, close to a multitude of restaurants and shops. Rooms are simple (no A/C) but clean and comfortable. Nice breakfast every morning with coffee, juice and pastries. It's a quick taxi ride to all the attractions in Tulum.",40,461
"Stayed 4 nights. The room is somewhat basic with no air conditioning,  TV or fridge. But it is clean and large enough with 2 double beds and a ceiling and pedestal fan. There is also a large hammock in the room. The location is quiet and fairly central to everything.the free bikes were well used and a money saver. The breakfast is a serve yourself continental breakfast and there is a fridge there for your use. A lot of the reviews mention the owner as a major positive, and she truly is. She is so friendly and accommodating, but also laid back and easy to talk to. We had a great stay in Tulum and really enjoyed our stay at Villa Matisse. ",50,461
"We stayed here for 4 nights during our stay in Tulum. It is a few steps away from the main road so maybe there is a little bit less traffic noise. The rooms are tidy and clean but nothing special. The manager was nice but he did not speak any english. They have bikes which you can borrow to ride to the beach for free. The breakfast is basic, but ok. Wi-Fi existed, but at least in our room the connection was poor.",40,461
Lourdes has a warm friendly laid back style. Very welcoming & helpful. Room was clean and very comfortable. Great value. Complimentary coffee every morning to get you on your way.   Use the free bikes to get to get to the beach. The stretch past Posada Lamar seemed best.  ,50,461
"Aside from the great location, this hostel is a no-no. As a member of group travel trip with G Adventures, we stayed at this hostel for 2 days in February. Upon arriving, the outside looks very good, but looks can be deceiving. The main area is pretty spacious. It feature multiple couches to lounge around, as well as some literature and pamphlets to read. There's a front desk and beside the front desk is a bar, as well as an outdoor patio area, kitchen, and upper deck. Our group was split into 4 groups - 2 groups of females, 2 groups of males. My group was given a room right on the main floor. It was about 6 of us in a dorm style room that seemed to be falling apart. For one, the lock on the door was flimsy. The room had 2 bathrooms, both of which needed to  be updated. My",30,462
" biggest issue is the fact that the shower would flood whenever we took showers. Water every where! The shower head had lime deposits on it so, if you turned on the shower, some of the holes were blocked and would spray all over the place. Soooo frustrating. No full body mirror available, no outlets in the bathroom. I could go on and on. Staying on the first floor also meant noise all night long from their parties, but not terrible. I'll say it probably ended around 12-1am, not bad. But you could still hear when people came and went throughout the night. If you are looking for food, you'll have to make your own meal and wash your own dishes, I wasn't expecting that so, I opted to dine elsewhere.  Among the good things, I'd say it's an ideal place to stay for a solo traveler. The facility hosts a number of activities throughout the day like morning Yoga, and nightly fun in the patio area with a DJ pumping tunes. It allows you a chance to mingle and meet others. Drinks are also free @ the bar (I believe!). They offer bike rentals right next door, which is super convenient. Above all, the location was very ideal. I was walking distance from the strip of shops and restaurants, and only a few minutes away from the beach. Staff were generally friendly and helpful, no issues. Overall, it was a decent stay but I would not return nor would I recommend to others.",50,462

"To be fair it was the biggest dorm room we were in for 8 of us, but the room was down a narrow corridor. The location of the power plugs were inconsistent for the beds - there was only 3 plugs in the room which also had two fans (only one worked), thankfully there was an AC. The floor of the room was very uneven, had different levels of concrete in some places. The location was good for the restaurants and shops on the main roads.",50,462
"My fave hostel so after 5 years I obviously came back to it! Extremely satisfied as alwyas. Now the hotel is located right behind the main avenue so away from the traffic bustle and good sleep guaranteed  Free drink every evening, free salsa lessons, karaoke, free pool (an adittion!)..Great staff; their world-embracing smiles all over the place make you feel welcome all the time. The owner Abraham always there to help! Comfortable, clean beds; generous breakfast..until 11h! Worth every penny, so make it a slam-dunk decision and just go! I recommend the place unreservedly:)",50,462

Super clean, lovely decoration, friendly and helpful staff and a nice pool area to start your day or 'recover' after a journey or day in town.

I don't often write reviews but liked Amorcita Corazon so much that it is with pleasure that I write this.",50,463
"I couldn't have chosen a better hostel for my Tulum stay. The girl from Uruguay working at the reception (sorry I forgot your name!) does an amazing job. She is helpful, always smiling and provides great customer service. I had asked to change the room (it was just a matter of personal preference, the room was perfectly fine but I asked if we could be transferred to a different one further back) and she and the manager accommodated us without question.  The hostel has great WiFi, a nice rooftop terrace with a pool and an overall great, laid-back atmosphere.  The hostel is located close to the ADO bus station and to different amenities (pharmacy, grocery store, etc).   I highly recommend!!!",50,463

Clean rooms, lovely little balcony (which was great for drying the dive gear :-)). If I'm back in Tulum, I will definitely stay here again. Very chill place with lovely character. They were also kind enough to print some tickets for me when I forgot to make copies before leaving home.",50,463

There is pure drinking water available at all times, to refill your bottles. The hostel is inviting, breezy and spotlessly clean. My dorm room had a balcony and another window into the courtyard. The bathroom is en-suite. The entry lobby has comfortable chairs, swings and an open air courtyard. The rooftop has a small pool, deck chairs, and a well stocked kitchen where you can cook.

Kendall and Rob were excellent hosts and helped us schedule everything we needed for the long weekend. We spent a lot of time down at the beach bars by Taboo (15 min drive) so needed to coordinate rides accordingly. The staff on site was also excellent…Jose and Jesus will take great care of you. The house was truly incredible by any standard!  I’d recommend paying for groceries before you arrive so the fridge is stocked upon arrival. The chef service was also worth the price.

The accomodations are top notch - clean, comfortable, luxurious. The space has great social area for groups especially. Kendall was an incredible host, helping us plan and execute the trip, arranging chef and bar service, outings, etc. her hospitality was the highlight of our trip… she got us medicine when a friend was sick. The house is easy for drivers to find from the beach zone and is a quick max 20 minute trip to anywhere you need to go for dining/nightlife. If youre traveling with a group to Tulum, Jungle Keva should be your top choice for accomodations",50,464

If you are looking for a peaceful, zen place to unwind that does not skimp on the details, this is your location.  The rooms were GORGEOUS, especially the bathrooms.  Because we were in a group, we had the entire facility to ourselves.  I can't speak highly enough of Kendall and her staff's attention and assistance, including restaurant, beach, and transportation recommendations.  I read other reviews that complained about the bugs and the heat, however, it is located in the jungle terrain of Tulum, so I think bugs and heat are to be expected in its location.

Many bugs including large spiders in room.  Isolated to an extreme.  so far away from anything that if you don't have a car a taxi is needed.  No hot water at the end of the day.  Also rock hard mattress on top of a concrete pad, hard pillows and scratchy over starched linens.  My dog has better accommodations when boarding.  If you want the quiet jungle experience complete with vicious mosquitos etc than this is the place for you.  I checked out after 1 miserable sleepless night.",50,464
Full disclosure that (a) I am a first time traveler to Tulum and therefore did not know the area when I booked; and (b) I did not do my usual fastidious research before booking my stay here having only read the most recent TA reviews plus the Tablet Hotels description of the property. Had I read all the reviews or looked more closely at the Lodge’s own website I likely would not have booked Jungle Keva given my specific needs during my stay. This is in no way Jungle Keva’s fault or any real criticism of the property. Not all properties are right for all travelers which is why I find TA so helpful given it allows crowd reviewing of each property. I therefore am writing this only to make sure that other travelers in a similar position to me book with a full understanding of what,20,464
"I attended Life Source’s Dia de los Muertos retreat over Halloween.

I returned home rested, refreshed, clear headed, inspired, and motivated to take my life on by storm and get into action.   Life Source’s retreat was the perfect balance of free time, tourism, and a multitude of workshops to help with my spiritual growth and learning.  I had plenty of time to enjoy the beautiful beaches and amazing weather of Tulum, explore cenotes, ruins, and the local culture as a group or individually, as well as learn from and be guided by our retreat leaders and share strength, experience, and hope with my new friends at our workshops.

I personally participated in everything as I didn’t want to miss out on a single thing.   Greeting the sun every morning with our Shaman, Avelino, followed by yoga, and a group breakfast, set each day off to a magnificent and positive start as well as quickly got our group comfortable and acclimated to each other; it was as if I knew these people that I just met an entire lifetime. A very calming and tranquil feeling.   The Sunset Sharing Circle, held on the beach as the sunset, was perhaps my favorite part of each day.  Together, we reflected on how we felt about that day’s journey/activities/experiences as we watched the sunset. It was very inspiring to have a conversation with so many likeminded people in safe and compassionate environment.  I truly felt there wasn’t judgement and when I spoke my fellow retreat attendees and leaders actually listened to me, heard me, and provided feedback if requested. This doesn’t happen in the “real world” often and was extremely refreshing.    Michele Clark and her team sure know how to put together a first-class retreat from start to finish. I have attended quite a few other retreats and I have to say nothing compares to a Life Source Retreat. Life Source trumps every other retreat regarding overall experience and attention to detail to ensure a truly life changing experience.   Thank you…I found my people….I’ll be back Life Source Retreats!",50,465

"I was long overdue for not only a vacation, but one that focused on my entire wellbeing; physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Never in my life have I experienced such an intense and life changing place and group of people. Not only did I feel completely at home, safe and surrounded by love and great energy, but also felt incredible support from Michele and her wonderful team. This may have been my first, but definitely not my last!!",50,465
"This retreat was unlike any other I've attended!  From the moment I arrived I knew this place was magical.  Each day was a new level of self awareness and self love.  Life Source Retreats was much more than a luxury vacation with great food, it was life changing and gave me the tools to bring back to my day to day life.  Thank you Life Source Retreats and be back soon!",50,465
"I participated in a group retreat in October of 2016.  I had recently gone through a break up and was a little intimidated traveling out of the country alone to interact with a bunch of strangers.  Life Source understood my fears and met me at the airport in with refreshments and an airconditioned van.  I was welcomed by Michele and the Shaman Aveleno within minutes of my arrival.  Within days I felt reconnected to source and rejuvenated.  I received a healing by the Shaman, Mayan clay cleansing, and a sweat lodge cleansing.  I bonded with everyone in the group and still keep in contact with them through a private snap chat.  Thank you Michele and Life Source it truly was a much needed Rebirth! -Jackie",50,465
"I'm still on a spiritual high from my amazing experience at LSR's Live Life on Purpose/Laws of Attraction retreat.   The accommodations were just what the doctor ordered, as I looked out from my bed at the white Tulum sands and heard the waves hitting the beach. The food was both healthy and delicious, and the attention to detail from Michele and her team was second to none.   In addition to all of that, the information I gleaned through a week of hard spiritual work and shard experience with a handful of corner strangers - now lifelong friends - has already begun to make a difference in my life.  Memories and life affirming lessons learned in Tulum. Everyone should participate in a Life Source Retreats. I know I'll be back!",50,465
"I cannot begin to explain how magical, transforming, relaxing, and amazing this past week has been for me.  I found all of the people working for Life Source Retreats professional, warm, amazing energies that were sharing with their gifts whenever possible.  I learned so much in our discussions on Abundance and the Law of Attraction while sitting watching the sunrise with our amazing Shaman, our fantastic morning yoga sessions, enjoying all the healthy, delicious food, discussions, excursions and the peaceful healing powers of magical Tulum.  I can't say enough about Life Source Retreats.  I wish everyone I know could enjoy this opportunity in their lifetime...",50,465
"I spent a week with Michelle and her team and they made my days! The atmosphere they created around and the beauty of the location, the sound of the sea and the ocean... The visit to the Cenote, the clay, the mayan ruins... It's been such a fantastic week! People in the hotel are helpful and friendly, food is deliciuos, what else can i ask for?",50,465
"I just returned from LSR's Power Light: The big Leap and I am still processing just how much of an impact this retreat has had for me during and after my stay. It truly has been life changing. The workshops, excursions, awesome team, accommodations, and food are all top notch. The people I have met in the 5 days are nothing short of incredible and am thankful for the friendships forged.  Michele and team - Thank you! Life Source Retreats was an experience of a lifetime I will never forget.  My advice...Just Go! you won't regret it.",50,465
"It’s a great place to relax, there’s no many places with no workers behind you like mosquitos and I really appreciate it!!!. So if your the kind of person who like to have waiters, chefs, room service etc... This is not the place for you. Just the basic to feel free. What I don’t like it’s the salty water for shower, beds are too hard for me I would like a nice mattress beside the hard mattress. Also the bar Eufemia it’s on one side the hotel and it’s always crowd and with music too, if want a no noisy place this isn’t your place again. Constantly a green smell comes out (believe me it’s not  forests I’m pretty sure) probably from the camping place aside or from de bar. ",50,466
"Hotel Amoriera is the perfect place to relax and unwind. We stayed there 5 nights and enjoyed our time. The room was rustic, but large and comfortable. We love that there is not air-conditioning - we kept the windows open to the breeze and the sounds of the waves. The breakfast was simple, yet delicious. We ate when we wanted, and were served within minutes of sitting down in the open air breakfast area. The shared kitchen is large and clean. Though we chose to eat in restaurants for our other 2 meals, we noticed other guests cooking their dinner.  Hotel Amoriera is within walking distance from some of the most popular restaurants (Hartwood) restaurants. We rented bikes from the hotel and biked to the ruins. If you are not into exercise, every thing is a quick taxi ride away. ",50,466
" My highest praise, however, is reserved for the staff.  I was so relaxed in Tulum that I left my passport in the hotel safe and didn't realize it until we arrived at our next destination on Cozumel.  The hotel staff immediately discovered my mistake and tried to contact me by phone and email. After a few email exchanges, we decided to meet up with Juan (a hotel employee) in Playa Del Carmen. We met at the agreed meeting spot and made the exchange. I offered,insistently, to pay him for his effort, but he refused. Truly, he saved me so much time and money!  We will return to Hotel Amoriera on our next visit to Tulum. It was a wonderful place.",40,466

"The location is awesome, right in the middle of shops and restaurants and a market right next door. It is also located next to a beach bar Le Eufemia which is fun. The hotel feels like a tree house and is super cute and authentic. They have bikes for rent at 150 MXN a day which is convenient. You will hear the ocean loud and clear as you fall asleep - positive to me but light sleepers may need earplugs. The little hummock's right in front of each room and chairs to lounge are a nice touch.  Things to note:  shower pressure is non-existent and the water is either scalding hot or cold, and you may not want to wash your hair anyway because the water is salty. Breakfast is fruit, eggs, bread or cake and yoghurt with granola - it but will keep you alive - they could easily add",40,466
" healthy fruit/veggie shakes as an option which does not cost a lot. There is security on site but saw the guy sleeping at night (around 10 pm) when we were walking in - not reassuring.  All in all a nice place, clean and cannot go wrong being right on the beach.  At $250.00 a night slightly overpriced but would stay again.  ",50,466
…,50,466
"Stayed in a sea view room - and what a view!  It was fantastic to wake to the waves rolling in on the shore and look at the water.  The rooms are built into the treetops  and you walk around on small pathways in the trees as well.  It’s a small and cozy hotel.  Breakfast is ok, and there is a good and cheap beach bar right next door.  I hope to come back! ",20,466
"We loved the room and the hospitality of the staff. The room was relaxing and left you feeling isolated from everything around you. But then you can simply wander down the beach or street and reach any of the amenities and popular spots in Tulum. The tree house feel was awesome and the breakfast everyday was enjoyable. From the bad reviews I've seen, it sounds like the reviewers would have been better suited at a more generic all-inclusive. If you want an escape with a slightly rustic feel then look no further",40,466
"What a beautiful spot! Our room overlooked the beach, but it felt very private. Very bright and clean rooms which had been recently painted. The full breakfast every morning was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious. The communal kitchen is fully stocked if you feel like preparing your own food. (We did not, rather we opted for dinner each night at one of the many great restaurants) The hotel staff could not have been any friendlier or more helpful. The young couple managing Hotel Amoreira gave us great suggestions of places to visit and things to do. Clearly, Dylan and Lourdes are very interested in the comfort and needs of their guests. We would definitely return.",50,466
The most relaxing place I’ve ever stayed at.  Room was extremely comfortable — very quiet; windows on three sides with screens and shutters; porch overlooking the ocean (two chairs and two hammocks!).  Comfortable beach lounge chairs with umbrella.  Lots of restaurants in walking distance.  ,50,467
"My husband and I stayed at Tita Tulum in February of 2019 and just returned to it for 4 days. Unbeknownst to us it has been sold and new people are running it. We were never notified until the night before arrival when they said they would honor our reservation that we made directly with them on our last stay. We arrived yesterday to find it in chaos, and the lovely simple beach bungalow we are paying $250 a night for has been stripped of most of its furnishings and is now ridiculously overpriced!!! They are offering a “continental breakfast” which is coffee, small orange juice and sliced in half toasted hamburger buns (140 pesos regularly) in compensation. The strip of beach they are located on is still the best (hence the poor not terrible rating)but we are not happy with this",20,467
" situation at all. Had no electricity for 12 hours last night, which I believe happened all along the beach. So perhaps no fault but they should have generators. The restaurant is only open till 2pm and there is no more drinks service on beach. We have written a rave review about Tita Tulum in our blog but we now must say do not come here unless they again become the lovely property they once were. And if booked already. Get a refund.

"This used to be a family run hotel, for many years we went there.  We new the staff, they were excellent. Now everything has changed the staff is gone and the hotel is being run by different people.  No explanation. It is very strange.",50,467
"Tita Tulum is an amazing Ecological friendly Hotel, we stayed there one night. The scenic view to the ocean was amazing. The room was comfortable and spacious. We loved the trees and plants surrounding all the rooms at the hotel.  The hammocks looked appealing, unfortunately were dirty and sticky, we could not used them. However, a couple of wooden chairs at the porch room were a great place to rest and enjoy the breeze.",50,467
"I rented two rooms at the TiTa Tulum, one for my husband and I and the other for my mother. From the moment we checked in, we were welcomed warmly and made feel at home and at easy. The rooms are spacious with full ocean view, plenty of hot water and overall exceptionally clean and neat. The breakfast was delicious and served each morning on the restaurant deck overlooking the waves. Just gorgeous!!!! There was security posted at the main gate and at the entrance from the beach which contributed to the feeling of relaxation. The location is SUPERB!! Right in the middle of all the trendy spots, yet rooms far enough to not hear the music at night. Right across the street from Arca and Gitano, two of the best bars and restaurant in Tulum. You will not be disappointed!!! I'm already",50,467

"This place feels like a special hidden jem in the heart of Tulum. It is not “hidden” by any means (right next to many trendy restaurants and resorts) but has a super low-key feel and is just so relaxing. We stayed with our two young children (1 and 4 years old) and it was perfect for them. We really enjoyed the food at the restaurant and ate there a lot, or could also easily walk up the beach or down “beach road” for other options. The bungalows are rustic and perfectly suited to the atmosphere. We stayed in room 7 and there was a constant cooling breeze both on the porch and throughout the room at night. Based on other reviews, we didn’t expect to have electrical outlets in the room, but we did have one which was convenient for charging.   This place is dreamy and if you’re",10,467

"Came for a solo long weekend to relax, tan, do yoga and recharge.  PROS:   +Great location +Beach area with bed swings  +Beach party on Saturdays and Sundays - wasn't busy and good music +Staff was all very friendly  +Comfortable beds + AC at night  CONS:  - Roaches.  Scuttling all over the bathroom my first night.  I understand this was an eco cabana, on the beach, in the jungle.  Thatched roof wasn't airtight, so insects happen.  However (1) wasn't expecting 5-6 huge roaches running all over the shower and (2) the roaches I killed the first night, and several every night after, stayed there.  I told the front desk, they said the room would be ""extra cleaned"", but on checkout the dead roaches were still there.  I'm understanding, but expect basic cleanliness.  I wasn't able to",30,468
" fully relax in my room for the stay for this reason. - Moderately priced, but after the experience with roaches, this place became very overpriced for extremely basic accommodations - No hot/warm water entire stay - didn't mind during the day, but wished for at least an evening comfortable shower - Used credit card to pay my balance when checking in, paid a fee (expected), then watched others check in and there's the option to Venmo or Paypal transfer.  For some reason I wasn't offered this option so paid 4% when I didn't have to  Antonio at the front desk was very apologetic, tried to be accommodating during my stay and got me roach spray.  He was great - I just wish management did more to address these problems.",50,468

"We went to the restaurant ""Garden"". The best food in Tulum! They have an Italian Michelin star chef! Unique mix of modern Italian fusion with Mexican flavors. My favorite plate? Octopus! The place is not unique as maybe somewhere else..",50,468
"Don't recommend and way overpriced at $500 per night.  We got to tulum, playa mambo and once we saw that the room we definitely changed our mind to stay 5 nights.  We decided to stay one night and were forced to pay a 2 night minimum.  Place wasn't nice at all vs the pics online.  Weeds everywhere, beach area was dirty.",50,468
"I stumbled across Playa Mambo by chance, and what a find! It really is such a gem, Tulum is an incredible place but my stay at Playa Mambo really made it. First of all, everyone who works there is super nice and friendly! From check-in, to the staff in the restaurant and beach club. Nothing was too much effort. The accomodation was just perfect.. comfy bed with decent mozzie net, air con (during the eve), really great beachy decor, huge bathroom with hot water. I stayed in one of the cabanas in the middle of the complex. No beach view so I can only imagine how incredible those rooms are. On top of that, the sun lounge facilities are  so luxurious. They reserved a hammock bed for me, and it was just bliss! The food in the restaurant is on the pricey side but well worth it - huge",50,468
" cocktails! Included brekky was basic but very fresh.  Location-wise I was very happy, it’s a little far from the busier end of town (Matteos, etc) but an easy taxi ride. Lots of cool shops and cafes/restaurants/bars nearby All in all I’m blown away by my experience here and can’t wait to come back. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed! Not quite sure how it was such good value compared to other Tulum accommodation but I think it will be more expensive in high season. That said, I’ll pay it!",50,468

"The staff provided exceptional service, were friendly and very helpful. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome. They helped us with our bags, offered helpful advice and made me feel like I was home.  The location looks just like a postcard. White sand beach, swaying palm trees, beach bar, and comfortable beach beds and chairs. We were offered complimentary drinks (highly recommend the cuba libre and margarita). The continental breakfast was delicious and also complimentary. We stayed in cabana verde, which is right on the beach with an amazing full view of the ocean, from the bed. We could hear the waves from our cabana and had a cool sea breeze in the cabana day and night. The cabana comfortably accommodated 3 adults and 2 kids. The restaurant, also on",10,468
"The retreat in Cuba was wonderful in every way. We were well prepared thanks to Christina answering our numerous emailed questions quickly and patiently! The schedule was full of interesting and relevant activities including yoga every morning, sightseeing around Havana, a day at the beach, having the opportunity to support local artists and meeting interesting people wherever we went. Karolina, who lives in Havana and is very knowledgeable, was our guide and constant companion. She made every hour worthwhile and efficiently made changes if the schedule needed to be adjusted.  I will use Yoga & Adventures Worldwide the next time I want a grand Yoga adventure in another beautiful country.",50,469
"I wish I could give 10 stars! I participated in the Holbox retreat and it exceeded all expectations. The accommodations were incredible, the attention to detail and the personalization that Christina treats each person with is incomparable. All the organized events we did were so special and respectful of the local culture. Everything is optional and has a very laid back feel- but extremely organized and professional at the same time! Yoga teacher Sherry Sidoti is gracious, humble, respectful and just a wonderful teacher. Anyone from a super experienced yogi to a complete beginner can love her class and get so much out of it. I loved every single minute!",50,469
"Stop what you’re doing and immediately book a retreat with Christina and YAWW! After a life altering experience in Havana with my sister travelers and the Cuban people, I’ve already reserved a spot for Santorini in Sept! Christina KNOWS all the things ... where to go, who to see, what to eat, what to do ... we were always safe ... and always laughing! If you seek peace AND fun memories Christina has GOT you!",50,469
"Highly recommended organization to travel to Havana, Cuba. We went on a Support for the Cuban People trip that included daily yoga and lots of opportunities to interact with Cubans. Christina is highly responsive and assuaged any possible concern we as Americans might have about traveling to Cuba in an environment where the rules and requirements are changing. All the logistics for small group travel were organized without any issues and the entire trip went smoothly. Accommodations were in a casa particular with warm, helpful service, simple but comfortable accommodations and a fabulous location.   I’ll definitely book another trip with Christina and Yoga & Adventures Worldwide.           ",50,469
"Love Christina and YAWW! I did a retreat in Tulum and every single aspect of the week was dialed in perfectly. Vibes, space, food, yoga, activities and the people. Christina knows what she's doing and I look forward to joining another adventure! I recommend for a first timer or someone who is looking to fill their cup with a new adventure!",50,469
"Went to Cuba last year with YAWW and two friends and had the BEST time! The itinerary was perfect. Christina and Sofi are wonderful hosts. I always talk about what an amazing time I had in Cuba, which is not always everyone's experience visiting Cuba, so I feel very lucky that YAWW provided us with such a great experience. One of my top trips. Highly recommend this company!",50,469

"LOVE Y&AWW! Just returned from an epic, restoring, FUN retreat (Cuba!!!) with smart, beautiful fellow travelers; a lovely yogi and founder Christina and I'm only mad I waited so long. Don't even hesitate - these folks are pros and attract strangers who will become friends. See you on the next adventure!",50,469
I had never been interested in group organized travel prior to going on a retreat with Yoga Adventures Worldwide and now I can't imagine traveling without Christina and her wonderful crew. The yoga instructor was the best I've ever had and created a truly amazing environment for my mind and body. The accomodations and excursions were lovely and very good value. You won't regret traveling with Yoga Adventures!,50,469
"I’ve now joined Yoga & Adventures Worldwide on two different retreats, in Morocco and Cuba, and they were both indeed adventures of a lifetime. Christina and Sofi have curated immersive programs where you get to not only practice with amazing yoga teachers from around the world, but explore a new country’s heart and soul from an insider’s perspective. They have taken the time to seek out the best local experiences beyond just the “touristy” stuff. Whether you’re a seasoned yogi, beginner, a solo traveler or with friends or family, their trips will appeal to everyone.

"First impressions were great, looked like a nice place to eat. The hostess advised it was cash only and as we didn't have cash we went to leave, the hostess then said we could pay by transferwise and we agreed to do that.  Sat down ordered food, the staff at this point were all very polite and nice. The food was average and actually very overpriced but this wouldn't of been an issue but for the rudeness at the end.  When I asked for the bill another woman came over and said I believe you are paying by transferwise of which I said yes as this was what was agreed at the beginning. I said ""all I need is your email,"" even before I could finish explaining that is how it worked she rudely cut me off, ""that's not how it works, it's an account number, and we are only doing this as an",10,470
" exception for you.""   She was extremely rude with the way she spoken to us and ruined our night.  For future reference you can pay by email, the recipient simply needs to input the bank details instead of forcing the sender, in my case customer to do it.   Also don't advise customers this is a payment method if you are going to be so rude about it afterwards. It really let down the whole experience. If you don't want to take card payments because you want to avoid taxes, I actually have no issues with that but being rude to a customer who is out to enjoy an evening on holiday.. perhaps it's not the best role for you if being polite is such a difficulty.

"I was told about this restaurant by a fellow Mexican friend, and my partner and I thought to try it out as she had such great things to say.   It is located at the start of the Tulum strip, with needing to walk through a little botanical garden to get there. It was so charming and sweet!  The restaurant has excellent sea views and lots of seats inside and outside. The staff were great and had very thorough knowledge on the menu, flavours and ingredients. The food itself was delicious - there is no other explanation for it!   The owners dog was also around the restaurant, greeting people and being such a good boy.

"At first we were hesitant to book this place because it didn't show up on google maps (Daria Tulum- the boutique in the hotel did), it's not on Booking, and most of the reviews here are for the restaurant.  But after emailing with Carolina, we finally booked directly off their website (using a credit card) and we are SO glad we did.  We stayed in room 6 with our family of 5 (2 kings, one twin).  This place is stunning and charming at the same time.  The pathway through the property from the road to the restaurant is like a fairy tale... potted plants, candles, garden art, benches, windows, knick knacks, etc.  The ocean view from the restaurant is amazing and you can even eat right on the beach.  So every morning we had delicious breakfast (fruit/granola, french toast, pancakes,",10,470
" toast/jam, eggs, smoothies, juice, coffee, etc.) while watching the waves and several evenings we also ate dinner and enjoyed the salads and pastas.  From your room to the beach is just a matter of steps so the kids were able to jump in the ocean whenever we were there, hop out to eat, and go right back in.  There are beach towels, chairs, tables, beds, a swing, and cushioned lounge chairs with umbrellas (first come, first serve and you do compete with restaurant guests, but we usually found a place to sit).  Servers offer you drinks on the beach and they even have an in-house gelateria with really great flavor.  You can charge it all to your room and pay at the end with venmo.  The hotel also arranged covid tests for our return (could pay with credit card for a fee).  The rooms are charming as well, though the AC was not great.  It was very cold and windy on one of the beds, but not cold enough for the rest of the room and everything stayed damp the entire time.  The beds themselves were comfortable and the room was cleaned daily.  We were pleasantly surprised they refilled 6 bottles of water each day for us.    While parking is not guaranteed, there are 3 spots in front of the hotel and Carolina graciously saved us a spot each day.  We appreciated her hospitality and friendliness so much!  We did have some problems getting into the spot (a large vehicle will not fit) and sometimes another vehicle was in our spot and we would need to wait for it to move in order to park (this was stressful as the road is quite busy making it difficult to wait or circle back).  There is a pay parking lot down the road, but it is quite expensive (like $40 a day).  But overall, we are so grateful that Carolina helped us out with parking.  And really, all the staff are very friendly and helpful- such a pleasant atmosphere!  Also, there is no smoking on the property, which we appreciated (only allowed to the side of the main beach area).  The hotel is located south of the main hotel area.  This means better sand, but also a walk to major restaurants.  Walking on the road is busy and a bit stressful, but I love that the hotel is NOT located right next to a dance club.  While you could hear some music from the restaurant on one side of our room, it wasn't too loud and didn't go on too late and the sound of the AC drowned most of it out anyway.  We did not want to leave this place- we have so many beautiful and happy memories!  Highly recommend!",50,470

Chelo, since the beginning, was extremely attentive and also a great communicator. She was fast answering the emails, and once I got there, she provided me with ALL the information I needed to move around Tulum - including maps with distance and details.  You can choose to be in a private or in a shared hut (like in a hostel). This last option was my type of accommodation. I arrived in Tulum for the new year's eve, and I was by myself in this cute 2 floors hut with 2 other lovely women. The huts accommodate a maximum of 4 people and they offer lockers - it couldn't have been better. The price was a bit higher when compared to a normal",40,471
" hostel, but it included the delicious breakfast and bikes to be used during my whole stay (this because the hostel is a bit far from the city center). It was quite easy and fast to get to the beach by bike (since in Tulum the Taxi service is very expensive, with fixed fees).   The common areas are also enjoyable, with hammocks, chairs, and tables to enjoy a sunny morning and afternoon. And they also care about recycling, which I lovely!  I totally recommend this place. You get your own keys and are free to leave or arrive anytime. The only thing is that they do not offer a ""luggage storage"" in case you want to do your check-out and leave your luggage somewhere there until you leave the town.",50,471

The breakfast was amazing and she had no problems catering for vegans.   Gracias Chelo ",50,471
"Not only is it the nearest hostel to the Tulum beach. It is the cleanest, friendliest and most beautiful hostel I have stayed in. It is not a party hostel at all and there are only a handful of other people staying which made it calm and quiet. Chelo runs the hostel with her son and they make you feel like you are a part of their family. It is their home too. Chelo makes breakfast every morning of fresh fruit followed by something hot (different every day). There are bikes to use to cycle into Tulum or to the ruins or the beach and a fresh towel.  Yes, she takes your passport and locks it in a safe. Much safer than in a room if you ask me and saves on money for a key deposit like in other hostels. Yes, she sprays your bags. Brilliant idea!

Bikes and snorkel equipment were included with the room.  The grounds are well maintained and the free breakfasts (actually homemade by Chelo) were incredible! The location was great.  Equidistant from the Tulum Ruins and the downtown area (about a 3 minute bike ride to each. It is on the main road, but we had the fans turned on and night and couldn't hear any road noise.

I arrived in Tulum at 10 pm because I was taking the ADO bus from Chiquila late afternoon and it took me forever to get there. It has been my very first time visiting Tulum after 10 years and it has changed a lot. ( I was a bit stressed as I was not able to use any ATMs to take money out because they all were out of cash, so I thought I won't be able to check-in by not paying my all 1-week stay at once.  There is a big wooden gate entering the hostel but somehow I always passed by not recognizing where the hostel was actually located. It is about a 7-minute walk from the ADO Station Tulum Centro.    When I",50,472
" arrived I was welcomed by a wonderful lady called Theresa, and a very friendly chap called Alex, explaining my cash situation but they let me check-in anyway, so I could pay my entire stay the next day. They went over and above explaining the entire facilities in Spanish. I was really happy getting there.   Things I liked about Chill Inn.  * Spacious dormitories, each bed comes with curtains, so you can have some privacy.  * Every dormitory has its own spacious bathroom and toilet * Fan is provided in each room and the rooms are airy anyways. * Locker space provided just aside from your bed (but have a lock with you anyway to lock your stuff, bags)  * You have a little fan attached to your bed as well next to a plug where you can charge your phone while you are sleeping. (More on that below) * I loved the area with plants on the side and the hammocks in the common areas.  * Common areas such as bathrooms, toilets were always cleaned, well kept and toilet rolls were always there. ( Not many hostels looks after that) * Theresa was making our breakfast every morning. (Fruits, pancakes, eggs, toast, that was something different every day) :) Fresh coffee, tea, and free water on the side to fill up your bottles. * If I did not know where to go, everything has been shown on the map and explained in Spanish by the staff. * Bike can be rented at the hostel for 100 pesos (They even let me rent one after I have checked out) * Loved the shell taps above the sinks.  * 20 minutes bike ride to the beach from the hotel. * 5 minutes walk to the main street. * 3 minutes walk if you want to have some street food from locals. * There is a place called Fruteria del Pool to get a wide range selection of fresh fruits from locals- 3 minutes by bike, 10 minutes walk.  A few things that Chill Inn could do better. * In the bathroom (In the rooms) there is a shelve hanging upon/bent down from the showerhead, and so my small bottle of shampoo was keep on slipping off the floor. The shelve is not as strong or not attached well to the wall. *I do travel with a bigger universal adapter and because of the size, I could not plug my phone to charge next to my bed. The little fan was just right next to it and therefore could not manage to squeeze my adapter in.   Good to know: * There is no laundry in the hostel but there are many ""lavanderia"" nearby. * There is always someone in the hostel and no unauthorized person can just come through the main wooden gate because it opens with a code. I felt kind of safe because of that.  * No deposit was asked at check-in. * If you arrive in Tulum late, make sure you have enough cash on you because ATMs are out of money sometimes. (Neither at the ADO bus station nor in banks such as the HSBC.)  I met with a few amazing people at this hostel and I liked the hospitality, care & attention I received. I will certainly recommend Chill Inn to other travelers and I will return.   Muchas gracias por sus apoyo y nos vemos un rato. Saludos Cordiales. Csilla",50,472

"Really chill place with nice tropical hippie vibe. Very well located. Close to colectivo base and central road. Our room for 4 people was with an air conditioner, so it was very comfortable. Kitchen is spacious and has all utilities. Owners are beautiful people. Breakfast prepared by Teresa are delicious, coffee was really good. In hostel are two beautiful cats and two dogs. cutest creatures ever!:) the only thing we didn’t have hot water. but the rest was spotless :)",10,472
"Room was clean and tidy with appropriate storage, bedside power points, lights and fans. Facilities were nice enough and the vibe mellow. Not a party hostel by any means but a good cheap option close to town. Breakfast was cooked on arrival and always tasty. Special shoutout to one of the volunteers, Ethan, who was highly accomodating and always up for a chat and some Tulum tips. Gracias!",40,472
"I’ll make this brief. If you are a racist and on a budget then this is the place for you.   If your not - keep reading. On my checkout day I was seated at the kitchen table preparing to leave and about an hour later, still within the 11:00 checkout timeframe, I said Adios! to the owner and headed to the bus station.   I was maybe 3 steps from the hostel when the owner came out, started yelling and accused me of stealing $400 pesos from her bag. What!? She said that I was the only one in the kitchen and told me to give back the money that I stole from her. I calmly assured her that I didn’t take any money from her and also had proof of payment for my entire stay.   After she finished yelling and finally called one of her volunteers to translate she went back to the kitchen - only",40,472
" to realize SHE HAD THE MONEY ALL ALONG.   My entire time here she was unwelcoming. I checked out when I did because I suspected she was racist, but full proof came today.   I understand and write Spanish better than I speak Spanish and many times she referred to me in derogatory terms along with one of her other volunteers - often starting with “El Negra” and followed by a slew of derogatory references.   I even listened as one of her volunteers had a full on conversation with his friends where he referred to me as “Ok - but she’s black” ...  as if I need an opinion from someone that works at Tulum's premiere trash motel.   The owner is cheap and every aspect of this pace shows it from the breakfast to the broken fans in the dorms.   DO NOT STAY HERE - ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR.",40,472

"Special mention to Gustavo. He looked after us so well while we were waiting for a late bus. Very friendly, incredibly helpful and genuinely wants to get to know and talk to you ! Such a good guy and very hospitable. Best shower and the beds were soft and really comfy. Gave us great information about the activities to do around the area. Bikes are 80 pesos with a company two blocks away !. Great idea and biked to the local Cenotes. Fruit and eggs for breakfast the next day ! Yum ! Again Gustavo is a hero ",50,473
great 2 days at El Jardin de Frida. Staff where very helpful and friendly. very clean room and not crowde. Big kitchen and super healthy breakfast. THen f you want to enjoy a glass of local wine they have this nicely decorated bar. Highly recommended.,50,473
A lovely place to relax after a busy day at the ruins or on the beach. Breakfast is substantial and beautifully served. We had a huge private room with en-suite. Lots of hot water. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our dinners. Staff were helpful getting us on the right bus for our onward journey. ,50,473
"Everything about this place was wonderful - the staff, the gardens, the breakfast, the bed! The location is not quite central but we rented bikes and walked and nothing was too far out of the way! Highly recommend!",50,473
Very nice hostel!  Lovely garden area.  Bright colourful rooms.  Plenty of bathrooms and the best showers I've encountered in many years of travelling!  No bunk beds.  Very good breakfast included.  Resident dog and cat. Friendly staff.  Only negatives are that the internet reception isn't the greatest in the bedrooms (better in the common area) and the kitchen area is locked overnight.,40,473
"It would be enough to stay here for the tranquility of the garden, and the eccentric yet beautiful bohemian decor. Almost every inch of this place is Instagramable, but it’s the staff that has made it such a lovely stay.  They have been super accommodating and friendly and fun to spend time with as well. The food and drinks are also very good and an added bonus. Will miss this place definitely worth staying in Tulum!!",50,473
"A good hostel when you are looking for some quiet time. The rooms were a bit dark, garden was lovely aswel as the restaurant/front garden. Its a little bit out of town. But the restaurant across the street was amazing.",40,473
"We stayed 3 nights at jardin de frida and were absolutely happy there. It is located in the City center at a busy road. Nevertheless it is quiet due to its cute garden. It is a Bit far to the Beach (and the main touristic area) but you have everything you need: Little shop (oxxo), atm, bike/ motorcycle rental, restaurant (i recommend burrito Amor), Bus station ADO.  The staff (of the Hostel, Restaurant and bar - all 3 Next to each Other in one building) is super friendly and helpful. The breakfast is included and had a little variety Everyday. It was yummy.  It also has a little Kitchen and common area in the back if you wanted to cook. The room (double bed room - la sirena) was tidy and got cleaned twice during our stay. Plus: the bed was super comfy.

Diane & her husband were absolutely lovely! They were extremely hospitable. The breakfast she made every day was amazing! We felt completely at home! We would absolutely come back when we are in the Tulum area!,50,474
"Two beautiful suites with outdoor private deck on second floor and a hot tub and sitting areas on the third floor.  Wonderful art and artifacts everywhere.  The house is very private located in the woods as is the swimming pool. Diane and Phil are super hosts, but Diane is the star as the gourmet chef.  We were there for a week and never had  the same breakfast  twice.  Always a 4-course meal with fresh fruit and a variety of main courses from Swedish pancakes, various egg dishes, meats, and on and on.  Just down the road is a cenote for snorkeling or just swimming.  Across the road is the beach (beach chairs and towels are provided), and up the road is beach   with snorkeling and a small restaurant.  For a getaway this  can't be beat!",50,474
"5 Stars based on combo of food, hospitality, setting, privacy and amenities. It is hard to overstate the generosity of Diane's breakfasts and her hospitality skills, starting with fresh-squeezed OJ, fresh fruit plates, bottomless coffee and the sounds of Cesaria Evora. She follows this with just the right balance of sweet and savory - we were there for 9 breakfasts and each one was unique and delicious. She bakes incredible breads. Her egg dishes including crustless quiches were over the moon delicious, as were the potatoes. Meat eaters had both bacon and sausage, some mornings we would have Swedish pancakes or waffles and despite the incredible cost of real maple syrup in Mexico, you get it! You will be eating poolside in the jungle, with tropical bird sounds as backdrop, never",50,474
" rushed. The rooms are beautiful as shown, bed comfortably firm, high quality pillows and sheeting and an endless fresh water source thoughtfully provided. You have your own patio for privacy. Rooms are beautiful but not that large so plan on doing your yoga on the accompanying patio, nice big windows and doors can be left open so the sounds of the ocean are ever-present (in moderate temps which we had in Feb). You will wake to diverse bird songs, 4-5am if you are a light sleeper. Water at the sink lacked heat and pressure but the shower was good and hot. We didn't turn on the TV once. Small frig for leftovers and snacks. Closet not quite big enough for 2 people's clothes for 10 days, used a sofa for luggage and clothing. Steps up to your room from the pool and breakfast are steep and another set leads to the roof deck with hot tub, tanning beds and extra living room. Incredible views of the jungle and beach and of course the sound of the waves...by starlight!  Showers were hot with everything you need provided. Extra help for our golfing friends to get into a nearby course. Extra help finding dinner options, local healer etc... Would we recommend to friends? Already have...incredible value for the asking price. Great for 2 couples traveling together, no forced conversations with strangers at communal breakfast table. You need a rental car to get beyond the nearby beach, Soliman Bay and a few food options. All-in with insurance and taxes (buy total coverage, our car had a scratch, you may need it) the car came to around $75 per day for small SUV.  Allow 4 hours from touchdown in Cancun to Casa Amor del Sol and same back to the airport because of rental car return and customs.",50,474

"My girlfriend and I were 100% thrilled with our 5 night stay at Casa Del Amor. Highly recommended.  Starting from the top, we LOVED the roof deck, featuring a large hot tub, sun beds, and deck chairs. The deck has a great view for sunset, and an even more special view of the Milky Way each night. There is zero light pollution over the ocean, so millions of stars dance before your eyes.  The bedrooms are very comfortable, featuring private baths, a couch, and a stocked fridge (waters, beers, wine). We had a private sun deck adjacent to our room, and a shaded deck which is shared with the one other room.  On the ground floor there is a jungle to explore and a pool to dip in. So many options, and so little time.  As everyone else has said, Dianne’s breakfast is second to none. You",50,474
" won’t find a more enjoyable experience at the best hotel in your city. It’s that good.  We rented a car and found that very helpful to get to the cenotes, lagoon, etc. Dianne has great suggestions for activities so you don’t even have to research a lot before staying here. She also provides gear like snorkeling, life jacket, water shoes, picnic, etc.  We can't wait to return.",50,474

"Casa Amor Del Sol is a hidden gem on a quiet beach road about 10 minutes from the main town of Tulum. The house is situated across from the beach, in a beautifully manicured jungle setting. Our room was tastefully decorated with local textiles and art, had a fridge, satellite tv, and cd player with a large library of cds. Whether lounging by the pool, upstairs in the jacuzzi or on your private terrace, there are towels for your use and lots of places to relax. Flora and fauna abound, and being a bird watcher, I spent a lot of time outside photographing birds.  The real highlight is the lovingly prepared, lavish breakfasts that Diane the proprietress will make for you every day. From the table linens to the flowers and herbs picked from her garden, every detail is meant to please",50,474

Freshly baked breads and goodies will delight you. We took a few pieces of almond cake home on the plane, it was a treat!  Definitely rent a car so you can follow Diane’s suggestions for outings such as the Coba ruins, a much cooler setting than Tulum because of the jungle setting. And Caleta Tankah, a wonderful beach club with lounge chairs food & drink plus a fresh water caleta that creates a clean lagoon on the ocean for swimming & snorkeling. We went there twice because it was so nice.  We hope to return to this paradise! Thanks Diane",50,474

If you are looking for a fancy hotel with all the bells and whistles this might not be the best option. We stayed here for 6 days and the staff was more than friendly.  You can't beat a cheap hotel with a room with a view in a great location.,40,476
"We did book a standard bungelow just a 2 days before our arrival half November 2015. What a poor welcome and service! The pool was empty, no breakfast or a small bar where you could take a sip. Due to renovation there was no reception desk. The employee who was taking care of the construction was also taking care of handing out the keys. Strange introduction, definitely no warm welcome from a professional crew! The location is perfect, just along the beach, room was ok. Especially if you don't feel for a luxurious hotel. We love to backpack, but we love a friendly and cosy ambience as well... That was not the case when we stayed here. For drinks and fun and food we were forced to find other places nearby!",30,476
The owner and staff were very nice but the place just started to invest to renovate. I hoop that it will work out. We had a nice time but spend most of our time els ware.  The place is ver y basic and it is named the concrete hotel.,20,476
"I came to tulum in 2013 and stayed right next to this hotel. there was a taco bar in front. everyone was hanging out. the chairs and mats were out for people to relax. the hotel looked updated and clean. This past week it was a completely different story. taco bar was CLOSED. we were the only people staying there. never put out chairs and mats for us. we never had anyone talk to us. forgot to clean room. pool was dirty. no one cleaned the insane amounts of seaweed on the sand. NEVER STAY HERE. STAFF IS NONEXISTENT. DIRTY. NO TACO BAR. i ended up leaving 3 days early, and of course there was no refund given.",10,476
"I've stayed in several places in Tulum and I spent six weeks doing some budget traveling all over the Yucatan.  This may have been the worst place I stayed in the entire time.  No, the second worst.  But still.  The worst for the price.  I even paid low-season prices so I have no idea how I would feel if I'd paid high season prices.  I think it's clear from the reviews that people who get the budget bungalows here aren't happy and the people who get regular rooms in the main building are okay with it.  I did not see inside the regular rooms.  However, the main reason to find some other hotel is that the beach front of the hotel is very small.  Sure, you can walk up and down the beach from here and find whatever spot you want.  However, part of what you are paying for at the",10,476
" hotel is to have a place to sit on the beach.  This hotel has a few nice hammocks that I enjoyed, but the small beach area was crowded with hotel guests.  Other hotels have a much nicer beach setup.  Now to the ""bungalows,"" which are one of the better deals on the beach in Tulum, but definitely not worth it.  Tulum is tricky for budget travelers because there is no public transportation between the beach hotels and town.  So you have to decide where to stay and then take a taxi between town and beach, or rent a car or bike - not exactly the cheapest.  On one trip we stayed here on the beach.  On another trip we stayed in town.  Town was better.  The bungalows here were just depressing - like staying in a crude prison cell.  There were cockroaches, but when we mentioned it they didn't believe me, as though I couldn't distinguish between a cockroach and a gecko.  Other than having my intelligence and perception insulted, we also had a terrible time sleeping.  One room had a cement-block bed base that was noticeably not level, so we were rolling into each other all night.  I hate complaining about wi-fi in vacation spots on the beach, but the sun goes down here at 5 pm and there's nothing to do after you've eaten dinner and had a drink or whatever.  Walking around is even a bit tricky, because this strip of hotels is off-grid and it's very dark everywhere.  At other (more expensive) hotels I've been to in the area it can be romantic or relaxing, but at this place it was just really dull.  Thus I am going to complain that the wi-fi was spotty in an off-grid bungalow because for once I would have used it just to feel less like I was in prison.  My partner and I spent the evenings tucked into the mosquito net, hoping the cockroaches wouldn't find their way in, watching old videos on the computer.  Not what I had imagined for my beach stay.  Another word on cockroaches - I looked it up and these bugs are usually outdoor creatures in this part of the world, not a sign of a bad restaurant.  They hang out in piles of wood debris.  Sure enough, there were piles of branches and discarded construction materials near our room.  Oh, did I mention that the light was a bare fluorescent bulb over the bathroom sink?  you couldn't read by it.  Too dim.  It did not improve the atmosphere of the place.  The pool was cloudy, not clear or clean looking.  I never went in it.  You can't tell this from the photos, but the pool is behind the hotel, away from the beach.  People did not much use it.  I wonder where they even get the water for it - I don't think this hotel is on the city's water supply.  Suspicious.  The only up side to the place is that the taco stand outside was pretty good and relatively cheap for the beach.",50,476
…,10,476
"The room was nice and the hotel was on the beach, and in a central location. Most important the people were awesome. They truly took good care of us. The hotel was gated with a full time security guard. The manager recommended a great little day trip to a lagoon that turned out to be one of the high lights of our trip. Will definitely go back next year.",40,476
"Please do not waste your money, there are tons of nicer places. This was a shoddy place where the price did not reflect the hotel We're travelling and have stayed in some grotty places but we walked out without even staying a night. There was excrement by the pool, the pool looked filthy and the beach had piles of seaweed rotting in front of the loungers. There were plenty of wooden loungers but with no cushions on so you couldn't even use them. The place looked like it hadn't been finished with building work going on. The wifi code I was given didn't work but was told over and over again that it was correct and that it would work in an hour!!?",10,476
"I saw all the reviews for this place before booking and was very concerned, but I booked it anyway because it was the only place on the beach within our budget. As it happens, we were delightfully surprised and ended up staying an extra night, and wishing we'd stayed an additional night after that rather than heading up to Playa del Carmen as we had planned. It is not a beach resort so the rooms are not as fancy as some of the pricier places, but we had one of the Bungalow cottages which was right in front of the pool. It was clean and comfortable. There was no A/C, but they hadn't promised A/C and there was a fan which was fine. The service was also perfectly fine, there was some confusion when we first arrived because we had booked online only a couple of hours before our",20,476

The rooms are based round a small courtyard with loungers hammock and a small pool. The main shops and restaurants are only a couple of blocks away but the hotel was very quiet. Continental breakfast was included. The wifi for those who worry about this was a bit slow. The young man on reception (Mike) was absolutely charming and very helpful with advice on places to go.

"Charming small guesthouse, with just a handful of rooms around a courtyard, with a string of hammocks to chill out in the evening. Quite basic, but rooms get cleaned daily. You can get free coffee and tea with biscuits by reception anytime.   About five minutes walk to the main street of Tulum, with bars and restaurants and tourist shops. The beach is about 10 minutes drive or most tourists hire bikes to get around. People hang around Playa Paradiso beach club, close to Tulum Ruins, where you can either hire a sunbed and a beach towel or just bring your own and sit on the sand for free.

The simple reasonably sized rooms all face an inner courtyard which provides a pleasant place to rest after hot days on the beach. The hotel is situated a few blocks from the main street in Tulum Pueblo where all the restaurants and bars can be found. Just a short walk from the hotel to a large supermarket where you can purchase groceries, wine, beer etc to take back to your room and enjoy cold, thanks to the in-room fridge.  The very friendly staff, Cesar and Sadia are always available to help you enjoy your stay.",50,478

Que lastima, era nuestro lugar favorito!!!!!",50,479
"What a gem! We tried to book online and had issues with phone service so we took a trip down the beach to chance a stay. Arrived unannounced and asked if there was a cabana available and had the option of an apartment or beach view private cabana. Definitely opted for the private cabana and it was stellar! If you are looking for a luxury stay, this is not for you but we enjoy a backpacking style, less is more, and rustic is no problem! Private bathroom, clean bed, hammock out front, sleeping with the window open, listening to the ocean!!! There are loungers on the beach, a bar with an awesome bartender, friendly people working and also friendly bar customers. Walking distance to so many beach clubs and restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!",50,480
"If you are looking for a beach to land on in Tulum, come over to CM. They have a laid back beach bar and are happy to offer you some covered beach chairs in exchange for drinking and/or eating from their restaurant and bar. The views are perfect, the beach sand is soft and the water is calm.   As for drinks, you can expect to stick with your basic fruity cocktails or cervezas. They also offer freshly opened coconuts... was able to bring my chilled champagne and have them pour it for me, so long as we spent 300 pesos on food or etc... and we had nice shaded beach chairs and beach access this way. Their menu is limited to quesadillas and tacos, chips and salsa. Not a large menu, but enough to get by while you enjoy the beautiful surroundings. Would have loved to have a couple more",40,480
" salsa types and a couple more varieties of dish options.  A bonus, there are lots of talented locals frequenting the bar here, so you'll likely hear some live music later in the day.   We didn't stay in the hotel so my review is based solely on the service we received on the beach from the bar and kitchen. This is a no-frills, super chill place so you can just throw on a suit, a cover up, grab your hat and find your chair in paradise.",40,480

"We really loved this place.  It's at the very southern end of the ""hotel zone"" in Tulum on the beach side.  There are even more economical accommodatios at this location not on the beach but we opted for waking up to the waves for a few nights.  Keep in mind, you're paying for the location, not the accomodation itself.  Beachfront bungalow was VERY rustic.  It did have power but to be fair, it was kind of sketchy power.  My girlfriend got shocked trying to unplug the fan when the roof leaked water in.  You do have a private shower and bathroom and their beach bar is great.  Super cheap delicious eats and beer.  I think we spent all day eating and drinking and maybe spent about $40 USD.  Easily walkable to multiple other locations but probably would have been better with a bike. ",50,480
 We had a car but there is very limited parking in the hotel zone and not really worth driving around there.  We would definitely come here again!,40,480

But simply too basic for my taste: no chair or table inside cabana, unfortunate positioning of hammock on the deck, no ceiling fan, ants on the wall and salt water in the shower! If you like to sound of the ocean all night opt for a beach front cabin: the cabins are basically open and nature is all you can hear. Some things were not as promised: no breakfast available, not every cabana has a musquito net, beach bar closed, arrogant surfer claiming the beach area with wind surfing",50,480

"I at first liked Juan, German and Mario who work there. I am older and was traveliing around Tulum area last fall and winter. At first they gave me a good rate. The longer i stayed the more they charged me until they were charging me the equivalent of a small studio with kitchen even though i had small room. I had hurt my rib and couldn't travel well so was staying on. I tipped very well and i did not feel they were nice after the fact. Some other tourists were also traveling and staying across from me and one day spoke harshly to me in regards to my legnthy stay. They were heavy drinkers and i guess had been partying on the roof with those guys that worked there. i was offended by the attitudes behind my back that came out. i'm a nice person. it was unnecessary and rude. i",10,481
" wouldn't recommend that place. Surrounded by dogs too. barking all night. The staff does not try to curb bottle rockets during festival times and i suggest staying in an Air b and b outside central tulum because also, the noise of the bands and music playing in clubs are competeing with each other so the noise level is off the charts. In winter is terrible mariachi music all night at Mariachi Loco rest. The worst rest. If you like grease and rude waiters...it's your place.",50,481

"Hotel Nadet is the perfect stay. Perfect location with plenty of bars, restaurants, and shops literally 100-500 feet away.   The rooms are spacious, and very clean! Some even have kitchenettes. For $50 a night this is luxury.   You cannot go wrong by staying at Hotel Nadet. ",20,481
"My father and I stayed at Hotel Nadet for two days and three nights!   The hotel is small, quiet, & comfortable. I highly recommend it to anyone that really just needs a place to stay.  The hotels location is perfect! Right in the center of the Main Street of Tulum. There is plenty to eat all around it. Breakfast, lunch & dinner. At night the street comes to life with people drinking and having fun.   Totally an experience. Nadet was the best place for us to stay. The room was spacious and very clean. We had room #25 which actually had a small Kitchenette & a balcony!!   Love the place. Great price & a very friendly staff!!!  ",10,481
"We're couple that just walk in. we paid a four-day advance in cash and in dollars .  On the second day we noticed that we were wrong and in fact we need only three days than- we have a flight .  The hotel owner (which we never saw/talk) not agreed to return us the night that already paid ,  we even offer to take a cancellation fee and return us the rest of the money , we did not get a positive response .  We lost the night . Hotel is more than a place to sleep , is also dealing with human people .  Because of a small mistake now we have lost money , and there was no one to talk to . Importantly, the hotel was not full and there were vacancies .  Who serves only dollars should remain empty!! Also we had really bad small from the restroom which didn't fix.",40,481
"I was planning to visit Tulum this saturday. I called on thursday to make a reservation, the receptionist told me that there was aviable rooms and he asked for my phone number and my e-mail adress to send me the information so i could make my reservation.  Today is friday at 20:00 and they just called me to tell me that they don't have any rooms aviable, and they are sorry.. What i supose to do now? I'm traveling tomorrow and i don't have any place to stay anymore. Thanks a lot hotel nadet employees.",40,481
"The room was exceptionally clean! It was also very spacious. Not much to do at the hotel but who comes to Tulum to stay at the hotel all day and night anyway? It served its purpose, comfortable bed to sleep in , great bathroom with shampoo and even a small kitchen/living area, and the LOCATION was PERFECT. Close to all the restaurants, bars, shops etc. I would stay here again.  The only negative comment is that they don't have where to park your car and that there is not always someone attending in the reception area and check in isn't until 3 p.m.",40,481
"Was a nice And clean room, i enjoyed the night the there!!I will surely make another trip and stay at this hotel! I like the nice hot and cold shower, Also the Wi-Fi was great, i like the hotel cause it's close to many stores and places to eat,the taxi is also close to go catch!! Great place to stay i recommend this hotel   ",40,481
"Very nice small hotel right at the beach. I really liked interior and decor of the place - bohemian, rustic and a bit hipsterish. Every singe detail is thought through and fits perfectly into charming Tulum beach area. Food in the restaurant was delicious and staff vey friendly and helpful. Playa Kin Ha is a real Carribean paradise!",50,482
"rooms are no well maintained, flaking paint, clogged shower head, flimsy screen door, no air.  Garden view is actually restaurant entrance view.  Pots and pans clanking until 11 pm, raking of the garden started at 6. Staff was as indifferent as the rooms Lots of other choices in Tulum.  Choose one of them",20,482
Didn't stay at the hotel but were there almost every day. The beach is beautiful and almost always empty. The food is delicious and the staff is more then excellent. They even give you free hummus to snack on. Highly recommend a visit.,50,482
"I love this place! It maintains the essence of Tulum, super low key and exclusive, quiet and peaceful, delicious food in La Cocina de Corina, super nice personnel, everyone is making sure that you have the best time, very attentive. Right in the heart of the Tulum beach area, cozy, hammocks, quiet areas, private beach, not crowded, at your convenience. Highly recommend this place for a quiet relaxing stay in Tulum, with amazing people that will respond to anything you might need to make your stay super pleasant!!! ",50,482
"This Place was not great when you get there off Beach Road there is a mile long path of Sand to the Check in desk which is there Bar. so if you have lots of heavy luggage like we did you have to drag it thru it. Are room was on the 2nd Flr was a corner Room with a little corner balcony so tiny you could barely sit on it. No AC, Bathroom smelled, and the ceiling fan didn't work.  Also the guy there only said they take American Express CCards But we payed for the room with a Mastercard CCard Thru Booking .com was a little confused by that so make sure you have money with you. the closet ATM is about a mile and a half down the road if it works. The Food here was okay nothing great. Overall i would never stay here again i thought they were a bit rude to. The hotel does have Wi-Fi",10,482

We absolutely loved our stay at Playa Kin Ha! We stayed in the ocean front room right over main dining area. We spent the evenings sitting on our balcony sipping mezcal and watching the moon rise and went to sleep to the sounds of the waves. If you keep the sliding glass doors open the strong ocean breeze through the screen doors keep the room cool and perfect. The beach in front of the property is perfect and the vibe around the place is quiet but not too far away from the action! Taxis patrol the main drag and can whisk you up or down the tourist area for only a few pesos.,50,482
"This is a very basic boutique hotel that will meet your needs in a minimal fashion. We stayed in room 3 with an open balcony that faced the beach. My husband and I had a wonderful stay.   Pro's: -beach view room with balcony -good water pressure and constant hot water -towels and shampoo provided -clean room, however with wear and tear -an above average quality outdoor restaurant with great prices, right on the beach -nice and accommodating staff  -has a ""homey"" feeling -outdoor beach chairs, palapas, bean bags, tables (get up by 9:00 am to save your ideal spot!) -cute outdoor living room with hammocks, couches, outdoor shower to rinse from the beach -perfect location, right in the middle of the hotel zone  Con's: -No A/C, but we did not need it at all. The wind and fan kept us",40,482
" comfortable.  -The pillows were comfy, but the bed was a little hard. But not unbearable. -Shower head was rusted and broke when we got there -Mosquitos (but this was everywhere.... bring repellant) -restaurant does not open until 8:15am, which means I had to seek out coffee else wear (next door) until they opened.    I would stay here again if I was on the same budget. ",40,482
"Many of the adverted features were not there. Not sure if scam or incompetent. Sheets had blood on them. Room not cleaned. Staff asked for deposits, then said they were actually rental fee when we asked for the deposit back (scam again?). The building seemed as if it could fall down any second and was heavily slanted. The showers did not work. Rooms were unsealed and mosquito nets were not provided.",10,483

"FUE HORRIBLE QUEDARNOS AHÍ…  El hotel definitivamente NO CUMPLE con lo que oferta. Las habitaciones están extremadamente húmedas , el agua que sale de las tuberías es SALADA, los colchones están tan viejos que están sumidos y ni hablar de lo húmedos que están , en sus publicaciones en diferentes plataformas de hoteles dicen que tienen aire acondicionado pero no dice que solo está disponible de 8pm a 6am (o lo dice después de haber hecho la reservación)  Si se van a quedar en la zona hotelera de Tulum tengan cuidado, los hoteles no valen lo cuestan ",10,484
"I booked directly from their site and received a confirmation directly from the hotel’s email address. I cancelled my other hotel reservation after getting the confirmation.  Hours later, I received an email from the same email that sent me the confirmation saying that they no longer use their official site and that I could pay 1000 usd more for a smaller room for the 5 day duration . I was fine with accepting the smaller room,  but the increase in price is terrible business practice. Very disappointed in how this was handled. I could understand if it were a confirmation from a third party site but his is directly from the hotel.   I also could understand if it were a mistake price that was abnormally low, but that wasn’t the case either. They had an opportunity to make it right",10,484
"We made a reservation bye Booking for one night but when we arrived to the hotel we found it under construction.  They features shown in the Booking page were not available (no pool until June, they said).  When we try to cancel the people from the front desk and the Manager, don't know how to do it.  Finally we leave the property  with a very bad  experience.",10,485
"Well maybe this place would have been nice if we could have found it… but we spent hours looking, driving up and down the street asking all the locals we found for directions, and trying to contact them… and never found it. There are no signs on the street, no directions given, and nobody knew where or what it was. We booked it through booking.com, which directed us to a place called Playa Selva through their map, so I thought maybe it was just one place with two names (that can happen in Mexico), but it was a different place entirely (where we ended up staying instead and was lovely). Save yourself the trouble and book one of the many other well-marked hotels in the Tulum Beach hotel area.",10,486
Our stay at Casa Selva de luz was ok.  The location is right in the heart of tulum.  There are many beautiful shops and restaurants to visit all within walking distance.  the street is very quaint and beautiful.  The house itself is very clean.  We knew there wasn't air conditioning so that was not a shock but be prepared for the extreme humidity and heat.  We spent most of our time out exploring so it was not a big deal.  The backyard is cute and peaceful. The staff were very sweet and helpful.  The only two items that I didn't like were the two cockroaches we seen and our bed were two twins put together and once was higher than the other which made the bed very uncomfortable.  Other than that it definitely was worth the money if you are not to picky and would prefer to spend,30,486
"Agua fría y no dan factura una experiencia  fatal esta algo céntrico pero hay mejores lugares para quedarse por ese precio y con mejores  lujos, si les recomiendo que busquen mejores opciones en este paraíso tulum",10,487
"Sejour, bien. Le personnel est gentil et pro. On regrette vraiment le manque de deco dans les chambre et surtout le manque de meuble. le balcon sans chaise est vraiment dommage.  Il serait utile d'avoir de quoi poser ses affaires, surtout dans la salle de bain",40,487
"Sunset Bungalows is completely misrepresented in there listing and photos.  The property is a dump located in a sketchy area.  The rooms are shabbily built with exterior doors that do not fit their frames allowing insects inside.  The bed linens were stained.  The windows also do not fit there framing.  The pool was unsanitary and cloudy.  We walked in and immediately turned around and demanded a refund and a taxi so we could relocate to a decent property in a safer location.  We used Booking.com for our reservation, and after many emails with both the property and with Booking.com it is still unclear if we will get any refund at all.  Stay away from this property!!!!  You get what you pay for and if the price seems enticing and the photos appear nice, beware that it's all",10,488
Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful.  Very comfy and nice facilities.  Nice location in downtown and near to the beach   We spent a lovely vacation with my husband we will definitely come back.,50,489
"You don’t get what you pay for at Vida Silvestre. Good idea but poor execution. Noisy neighbor, terrible water quality, unclean, just to name a few of the problems.   We were attracted to this property by its solar energy and other ecological appeals. Booked three nights though Booking.com and specifically requested quiet room away from loud music. Unfortunately it was impossible to stay beyond the first night due to noise.   When we first arrived, we noticed there was a construction site next to apartment #1 which we were assigned. We did not want to make a fuss and hope it’ll quiet down. Went out for dinner and came back noticing a constant loud humming from maybe a generator. The humming was so powerful and felt like it was right behind the bedroom. Again we tried to be cool",10,490
" about it and planned to wait it out. By 11pm we realized it was not going to go away, texted the manager on WhatsApp. No response, no one on site to help us. Ended up the noise went on all night.   The next morning, tired and frustrated from lack of sleep, we requested to shorten the stay and get a refund for the remaining two nights. Manager claimed we were the first guest to complain about noise, which is not true as plenty other reviews said the same thing.   The management obviously knows about the problem all along with neighbor’s generator. They could have put us in other apartment away from it, especially we requested a quiet room in the booking note. We felt trapped and mistreated.   Additionally the hot water was iffy, and came out a little red in color. Water dispenser and switches are not clean.   Overall I strongly advise fellow travelers to stay away!",10,490

"The house was exactly like the photos and in a jungleish setting.  The house is partially thatched with nothing but screens for the downstairs portion.  We stayed in mid February which the temperatures are not that bad yet in Tulum, but I would consider somewhere else in the summer months, this place would be unbearably hot without AC.  The Tulum beach road has tons of foodie options available and we tried to hit as many of them as we could.  The only complaint I have of the area, not the house is the trash along the road as well as he old broken down hotels that used to be....",20,490
"We booked Vida Silvestre for our honeymoon last month, and unfortunately while there are some lovely aspects of the property, for us the trip was extremely disappointing, and would not be enough for us to recommend it to anyone.   Trying to give a fair and balanced review, so here goes:  THE GOOD  -the location is within walking distance to two beach clubs, aura and Be Tulum which you can use for a minimum resort fee.  -overall, our host Ivette was super sweet and did her best to be accommodating. -there's a small range and fridge which is rare on the resort side, so  it's great if you want to prepare your own meals and be close to the beach -there's an adorable dog we fell in love with, maluko, who came and hung out on the porch of our villa- and even does high fives!   THE BAD",10,490
"  -rats. In the middle of the night I got up to go to the bathroom, and in the dark felt something grab me. In a panic, I let out my best horror movie scream and my husband ran into the bathroom yelling- flipped on the light turned out to be a rat. The next day we searched for it, and found feces in the villa, so it was potentially nesting in there. Ew. -bugs. Can't be helped in a jungle, but many of the screens aren't 100% sealed, so slather up the bug spray. The first night I had over 30 angry red mosquito bites when I woke up, despite the net, and often woke up to them buzzing in my ears. There were also lots of spiders, and other creepy crawlies about. -heat & humidity. This is no fault of the villa whatsoever as they make it clear there is no ac. But, the property does get very hot during the day, so would recommend leaving it entirely except to sleep and going to the beach. They provide two small fans, but we still found it very hot to sleep at night.  THE UGLY  -our third evening in we found ourselves without any running water, so we could not shower after a long day at the beach, flush the toilets, wash our hands, wash up after dinner, wash our face before bed....you get the picture. The problem wasn't fixed until the following day, so let's just say it wasn't the most romantic thing ever. -our fourth night we found ourselves In a tropical storm...and our apartment completely flooded. Water was coming in through the ceiling in multiple points, and seeping in through the floors, there was no where to sit or be in the apartment without being rained on/damp or wet. And, for the second time, the water went off! We spent the night frantically emailing our host and using our only clean towels to try and keep the water from coming in. Our bed was wet from the leakage and we had a terrible time sleeping in the damp, flooded bedroom.   By that point, we had enough, and with no response from our host, we immediately resolved to throw in the towel (literally) on our honeymoon.  When we left the next day we let our host know what had happened, and they offered no refunds, only a different villa, or two apartments that were not in the location we planned to honeymoon at. We thanked them for the offer and explained we had already made non refundable decisions to leave the property, but still the manager Ivette was speaking with was unwilling to compensate us in any way for all of the discomfort during our stay.   Thankfully, Airbnb stepped in and granted our refund for the unused portion of the trip.  Overall, I think I would describe the property as beautiful but rustic. I feel/hope our experience was on the rare side, but unfortunately, based on our particular stay there, would definitely not recommend this property.   ",20,490

"I thought that Vida Silvestre was very beautiful, and I can't say enough good things about our wonderful host - however, I can't help but write this review because the place is filled with bugs. My friends and I booked 2 cabins for 5 nights, and ended up barely surviving 3 nights here. We are pretty tough travelers, but at the end of the day the heat and bugs got the best of us.  If you are looking for a ""glamping"" style location where the outside is inside, and vice versa, you've found the right place. For my group of friends and I, we have stayed in very rustic locations all over the world including Thailand and Sri Lanka. The bugs here though were worse than any other location I've ever stayed. I was eaten alive by mosquitos - bites totaling over 100 in a single day. There",50,490
" were also many other kinds of bugs inside of our cabins. I highly doubt there are this many bugs during the on season (we traveled in the wet season), but if you are planning to come during the summer, beware.

Avoid this place, its horrific!",10,491
"We choose this hotel for the very convenient price, its location at one edge of the main avenue where all the bars and restaurants are, and for the spacious rooms. In a few minutes, you are in the centre of Tulum pueblo and everything is at walking distance. For things that are a little bit further, like beaches, you can rent a bike at the property for around 150 pesos/day. Our rate included a small and simple breakfast with toasts and jam, milk and cereals.",40,491
"My upstairs room was clean, spacious and air-conditioned, and perfectly comfortable. I was in Tulum diving for a week, and I appreciated that there was plenty of space here to spread out my dive gear. The staff here is exceptionally friendly and pleasant, responding quickly to any requests. While the breakfast is a little skimpy, you are literally a couple of blocks away from places like Taqueria Honorio and Don Cafeto, or Ki'Bok if you need coffee. It's an excellent location near the main avenue, and I would be happy to stay here again the next time I'm in Tulum.",40,491

Rodriguez, the cheerful breakfast guy, went above and beyond to make sure his guests enjoyed the continental breakfast. He was always bustling around chopping fruit, helping the guests or answering their questions. He spoke good English. Room 105 was spacious and the king bed was comfy. It was great having a room safe in which to store our passports and money. Sometimes we slept with earplugs if our fellow guests were noisy or the road traffic noise bothered us, but most of the time it was quiet at night. We enjoyed relaxing on the second-floor terrace overlooking the street. The wifi worked well most of the time.The garden area outside our room was pretty.",40,491

Upon arrival, we were told in quite an unfriendly way that we were a bit early for check-in, and it was going to be very crowded so he couldn’t help us now. Of course it was our own fault that we were early, so we waited patiently at the pool for a bit (could not get towels while we were waiting because we couldn’t find anyone who could help us), and at 3 PM the reception was still completely deserted. Throughout our whole stay, it was sometimes difficult to find someone when we needed something, as the reception was almost always empty. Also the bar and the resturant were almost always empty, so we never were able to order for example drinks.  The cabins are quite roomy, but very poorly constructed. Due to this there are a lot of",20,492
" bugs inside. Moreover, and even worse, we had quite some rain during our stay and all three cabins that our group occupied had major leakage, even though we were on the lower floor of the two-story cabins. One of the leakages was during the day, and I must say that the person we could locate at that time was very helpful and immediately handeled it and made sure our room was cleaned again. However, the other leakages were during our last night, so we do not know how this has been handled now. Also, the cabins could have been cleaner, 2/3 days of our stay we had troubles getting hot water and the AC of one of the cabins did not work.   Overall, this place has a lot of potential and looks very glamorous at first sight (on photo’s) but is quite a disappointment.

Me and my friend where staying in January and it was so cold at night inside the bungalow that it ruined our sleep. We asked for extra blankets two days and not until our last night we got them after asking multiple times.  This made us tired during the daytime and I got a cold because of it.  If the walls are not good enough for the January weather they should have extra heating during the Mexican winter. Not have suffering guests.   It should be mentioned that the manager was so kind and helpful with other matters.   Also note that you are very far away from everything and without a bike you need to take taxis all the time.   ,50,492
"We loved staying at Green Tulum. It is a green enclave on the very edge of town, not quite in the jungle but it feels like you are, with thatched, wooden cabins among trees around a central pool. The rooms are basic but charming (sea shells for faucets) and very clean, with ""four poster"" beds equiped with good mosquito nets. It is a little walk into town and not all of the taxi drivers know where it is but the payoff for this is that it is very secluded and away from the noise of the traffic. Top tip; 2 great cenotes just down the road (Crystal & Escondido) about 1 mile out of town on the main road, one entry fee covers both.",10,492
"My boyfriend and I LOVED this hotel.   The cottage is adorable, conch shells as the faucets in the bathrooms. There are mosquito nets for the beds, hot water. The furniture is great. Its about 2 miles from the beach and about a mile to the main strip. We walked almost everywhere from the hotel. The pool is nice, nothing fancy but clean and refreshing.   If your looking for a fancy 1st world air conditioned rooms with cable tv and room service this is NOT the place for you. It really annoys me to see such bad reviews. Its about 30$ a night in a very bohemian town, I don't understand the complaints. Yes there are bugs, yes some of the rooms don't have AC or tv, But whats the problem??? Your in beautiful Tulum; enjoy mother earth for once. ",10,492

I went to the hotel manager immediately asking her to call the cops which she refused and insisted that the bag can’t get stolen from her hotel. She said i should go to the police station if I wanted to report the loss, which I did.

Rooms are very nice, big with great bath rooms & showers.  The kitchen in our room was not that well stocked up, though but as long as we could borrow a wine opener, we managed. Breakfast is also on the spare side with just coffee, tea, a little bread, jam, butter and bananas.

"I stayed at Hacienda Scarlette for 7 days and had a great experience.  It is about 10 min outside of Tulum, you do need a car to get to it. I agree with the recommendation to get there during daylight as it is hard to find in the dark. Look for a green sign with the name of the hotel on the side of the road, however, exactly where the sign is  is the turn onto the dirt road. Needless to say I drove right past it as I arrived in the dark. They were doing some construction, additions to the property but the main building is large and very relaxing to spend time at.  I liked having a coffee maker and fridge in the room and after a trip to the grocery store did like being able to have meal in the room or make snacks for my time out and about. Just ask for silverware and plates. AC",10,493

"I travelled in a group of 3 friends. We had a bedroom with two double beds. The room was a bit small. For 4 people it would have been hard to organize all the luggage in the little space. Still, it was nice. Too bad internet was not so good. But kind receptionists, central location make up for it. ",50,494

"My husband, daughter and I highly recommend this very well situated accommodation in Tulum Centro. What we loved most about this place:  LOCATION- it is walking distance to a lot of the must go-to restaurants ( & the shopping areas! ) Very centrally located. It is also almost at the corner of a road that has a lot of street food carts so if you want to grab a cheap, authentic Mexican meal, it is but a few steps away. NEW, MODERN & STYLISH- this is a fairly new build, is aesthetically pleasing & it paid attention to the details ( at least most of it ). Sheets are of high quality, as are the white towels ( Zara Home ), mattress was the perfect mix of soft yet firm, the toiletries provided were of high quality that we actually switched to using theirs instead of what we brought ( a",50,496
"i spent one night in a tent and i think they have too much tents , everything is too close, i dont care about privacy , its a camping but that's too much the guy in reception is really rude, he doesn't care about people,  and he doesnt wear a shirt, never, so you will never know if he works there or what . i dont know if he is the owner or what , 0 commitment. 0 service , 0 customer care.  i met this guys passing thru the camping to the beach, chill guys, and this owner starts insulting them and trying to fight them.  i dont recommend this place, you will feel the weird and awkward vibes all over your vacations.  hope this is helpful for other travelers",10,497
"Today I was accosted by the manager over something so insignificant. I offered a simple explanation but he lost control of himself and threatened me. I told him to get back away from me when he threatened me with something physical like he wants to punch my face. I was going to stay over the summer, but I'm not going to risk my vacation or safety by allowing mentally unstable staff to threaten me.  There was a pleasant person in charge of the camp when I got here a month ago but she left. It was the best of times. All the visitors there were very welcoming and the place had a great vibe...until this control freak ruined the atmosphere.  I'm not the only one to be treated irrationally.

"The location is great! Right on the beach. It’s a quiet spot in the middle of what otherwise is a busy stretch. It’s nice to wake up with the sound of waves and watch the sunrise. It’s also peaceful as there is a noise ban after 22:00.   The staff were friendly. There is no food onsite, but lots of options nearby. If you walk north along the road about 10 mins there is a low-price tasty Mexican food place and yummy gelato shop.   You are surrounded by beach clubs on either side where you can get a sun lounger during the day, if you buy lunch/drinks.   Don’t stay here if you don’t like bugs, insects, sand in your bed, sand in your luggage, saltwater in the showers, and no electricity.   But if you do want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Tulum then it’s a fun camping",50,497

They have electricity, WiFi, hot water, few showers and WC, parking places. Take ur camera and go there!!!",10,497
"I'm very undecided about this place since they charge per person and not per tent. We stayed as 4 friends and were offered a tent of 4 for 350 pesos each. This tent was out of the breeze and basically in front of the 'car park' so we declined and were then offered a tent for 2, and 2 tents of 1 (3 in total). Two of us did not like the idea of staying alone since the vibe was not hotel but more a community of people who seemed to be living there long term, were not friendly and all the tents we were offered were far apart. Since they were large enough we opted for the tent for 2, and 2 of us shared one of the tents for 1, which were plenty big enough for 2 people. Mattresses were provided (mixture of regular and air) as were sheets and pillows. We were informed that we would need",50,497

Our original trip was scheduled for January 2022, however COVID-19 concerns made my husband and I decide to change our plans. The hotel was kind enough to switch our hotel dates twice (which we appreciated), however this is where the issues begin.  We made the initial reservation through Booking.com and used their messaging technology to update the reservation as needed. However, the hotel never communicated these changes to Booking.com after several requests via Booking messaging. Another issue early on was that the hotel didn't update their phone number, so we couldn't contact them for an updated confirmation or shuttle from Cancun Airport to the hotel. We",10,500
" also weren't able to use any of Booking's other services that usual come with their reservation system.  We has THREE representatives from Booking.com along with ourselves calling non-working phone number the day before our arrival. Only ONE was able to locate the correct number after weeks of trying... that's when we got nervous.  Upon arrival we notice that most of the first floor is undergoing renovations along with a new development behind the hotel. Now, the construction behind the hotel wasn't the issue. It was the LOUD drilling coming from the inside the hotel vibrating our room on the 3rd floor.   When I called Booking.com to complain they told me to work it out with the hotel. So, I approached a the front desk staff to ask why they didn't notify guests about the renovations, they just ""I know"" me to death...  The renovations started around 9am and ended around 7pm... the DRILLING and other LOUD noises and vibrations made me wish we stayed in Boston. My husband is a nurse and we were looking for some peace.  The next day our neighbors confronted staff about the noises and they straight up lied to their faces and ours saying it was the development behind. While a convenient excuse, the noises continued after that crew left and LOUD noises were coming from inside the hotel.  Not to mention the pool is located on the first floor, where you could hear all the construction from all sides and the beaches were loaded with seaweed. Where were we supposed to find relaxation?  At least the hotel will be nicer for other guests, eventually. But we feel completely lied to and taken advantage of due to the whole situation. They did nothing but lie to guests faces.   Had we not gone to the pool we wouldn't have noticed the room below us was under construction.   Stay here at your own risk. Don't except honesty.",40,500

We rented bikes and rode down to the Tulum Beach area(better than taking a car or taxi). Walking distance to restaurants and tours.  Hotel arranged for our covid testing at our room(which was nice).

A taxi ride to Tulum beach/the beach strip cost about $20 USD from here.    My only complaint was that we woke up very early to loud construction noises for multiple nights. There is a construction site directly behind the hotel, but I understand that this is out of the hotel's control. Consider this if you are a light sleeper/late riser.

Over 18 months on and with Mexico remaining almost exclusively on the red list from the UK, I was given an ultimatum by the hotel to use my credit before September 2021 with little warning and already a holiday booked elsewhere during this period.  After months of back and forth with agents at Booking.com (due to being ignored by Hotel Panacea directly), it seems that the power is all with the hotel.

The hotel was extremely badly located, 25 minutes by car from all the beaches and about as long by bike as the hotel rents out to its guests.  Secondly, the water in the hotel is not drinkable. This is of course to be expected in Mexico but one would have thought that the hotel would provide drinking water to its guests which was not the case.  The hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar which forces the guests to go out of their way to buy water or to have lunch and dinner.

The room is always clean with plenty of new towels, the bed is comfortable, the room is spacious, currently the ac is only working in the evenings but that seems to be the case in alot of hotels on the strip since the storms, which was fine as we had a big fan to keep us cool. Check in and out is always quick and easy, and it's located directly across the street from the beach. I have already recommended it to many friends. It's very affordable and close to everything.",50,504
"The location of Origen was amazing. Across the road from the beach and close to shops, restaurants etc. However the room had a few issues. The shower was very salty water (which i think is an issue with a lot of the stays in the area). The drains had a bad smell most of the time. Our room didn't have a bug net so we did get bit a lot. The staff are very friendly and cleaned the room everyday with new towels. There was no breakfast included but the place next door did a good breakfast.",50,504
"We loved it here. Beautiful boutique hotel that looks like an upscale treehouse. Wonderful decor, thatched roof, tropical, clean, great size, close to the beach, safe and great staff. Wifi and ac both worked fast and perfectly. We love Camilla the front desk/housekeeping Hostess. Super friendly, accommodating, let us have an early check in and a late check out as our flight was in the late afternoon. Directly across the street is taqueria La eufemia, our most favorite taco restaurant with full beach access and free beach chairs. Inexpensive compared to the other places and dog friendly, which we loved. This hotel is walking distance to everything and on the quieter side of the main strip. Highly recommend it. And look forward to staying there again.",50,504
"The rooms were like pictured, if not better -- adorable small boutique hotel. Excellent location - 50m from the beach, literally across the street.  Beach access through tacos Eufemia, which has no minimum spend and doesn't charge for beach chairs (rare).  Excellent price for the hotel -- they're new, so I think they're building up their reputation and clientele.  And Carmelina (in charge during the day) is just the sweetest and most capable! She was handling everything the day I got there -- check-ins and bed making -- and still found the time to have my room ready for my early check in. What really sealed the deal for me was that she checked up on me one night I had decided to spend with friends in downtown Tulum -- as a woman travelling alone, this was invaluable, knowing",50,504
Mike the owner will do backflips for you and is super well connected re reservations in the area.   The hotel  is a bit hard to find and is in central Tulum (about 20-30 minutes from the beaches and the ruins).     Look for a white building with a door made of wooden sticks.,50,505
"This place its so comfortable and peaceful, and it has a really good location, in the center of downtown closer to everything. And also the the hospitality its realy good, we felt like at home. We had a really good experience over ther with ghe best advices.",50,505
"I highly recommend Grand Balam Plaza. The location was perfect- easily walkable to all the shopping and restaurants in downtown Tulum. Plus, Tulum Beach was only a short drive (or bike ride away). Parking was easy and free.  Our apartment was cozy with everything you would need for a short stay- fridge, plenty of space to hang clothes, and a REALLY COMFORTABLE BED!  We also loved the lounges on both the 2nd floor and rooftop. Plus, 2 hot tubs. I mean, need I say more? The whole property relax felt very secluded... even though it's in the center of the city.  Mike provided AWESOME service. He was very responsive, helpful, and gave great off the beaten path recommendations.  Again, I highly recommend staying at Grand Balam Plaza.",40,505
We stayed here for my brothers 30th birthday and it was fantastic. The facilities were perfect. I recommend this if your in Tulum! great central location with luxury rooms and cleanliness! It has everything needed for a group,50,505
"This hotel was absolutely gorgeous! I loved our stay here. The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed with a modern Mayan feel. There are two jacuzzis on the rooftop deck! I also really enjoyed the in-house massage, so professional and relaxing. Breakfast was very good as well. For the price it’s incredible.",50,505
"My boyfriend and I stayed here 2 nights, and we had a wonderful experience. Make sure when you are coming that you are in contact with Mike (owner) via WhatsApp prior to your arrival and you won’t have trouble finding the place. We were able to park right outside the hotel on the street every day with no problem. The bed is very comfortable and there is a fridge in the room. We had a little outdoor sitting area that felt pretty private with all the wonderful foliage. We both had 1 hour massages in the spa area-we loved every minute of that (thank you, Alex!!). The lovely chef that made our breakfast (Brendy?) was so sweet and an awesome cook-bacon, eggs, fruit, avocado and bread made to order. We left stuffed and happy both mornings! The hotel is a few blocks (walking distance)",50,505
" from tons of restaurants and bars. Mike was awesome and gave us some really good suggestions on cenotes-we visited Gran cenote (get there early!) and corazon. Both beautiful in their own ways. Mike also gave us some tips on sian kaan and other things to do. He’s a great resource if you have questions. We really loved staying at the Grand Balam, and would love to return some day!",50,505

"Really beautiful hotel! Location was central, service was great, breakfast delicious. I loved the rooftop and spa totally beautiful place to spend time. We had a great time exploring the area it's a magical place. Thank you so much!",50,505
"very central located in town. from outside the hotel looks very simple, but inside it‘s absolutly amazing. everything is made with wood and they have made a very nice atmosphere with the lights. a lot of plants that you feel like in jungle/paradise. the rooms are very beautiful, the beds are big and very comfortable. they have hot water with high waterpressure, breakfast included and jacuzzi 24 hours. they also have massage from professional staff. i can just recommand this place for couples and people who like to enjoy their life.",50,505
"Strict with guests and pandemic regulations. Other than that, the building is in a great location and there is a nice rooftop.  There are helpful staff, who lined up a ride for us back to the airport. I would stay again when the pandemic is over.",50,506
"While this is a hotel, it also has a 4 bed dorm with an en-suite and private balcony.  I prefer dorms for their social atmosphere and was very pleased with this place.  A decent dorm in Tulum is a rarity, as most are basic party hostels.  Tulum is mainly known for its high-end beach resorts, while the town itself is a backpacker area with mainly nondescript tourist amenities.  The location is near the edge of the main town and convenient to the ADO bus station, etc.  The reception staff are very welcoming and helpful and provided a lot of good tips, including some that are not generally known.  For example, only a few blocks away one can catch a colectivo to the beach and back with the locals for a few pesos.  Be sure to enquire about the price difference between paying cash and",50,506
" using a credit card at this hotel.  The amounts I was quoted were significantly different, and they clearly prefer cash.  This was my only dismay with my experience at this hotel.  The dorm was amazingly well appointed for a property that does not specialize in shared lodging.  The towel and toiletries were locked in my own storage locker, which was large enough for both my carry-on and backpack.  There is a well-appointed en-suite and large private balcony with chairs and table.  The wooden beds are solidly built and the mattresses are thick and high quality.  Each bed has privacy curtains, a shelf for toiletries and a plug-in to charge devices.  I really enjoyed the huge rooftop terrace with city views and a range of seating options in the sun and shade, including hammocks.  It was seldom used while I was there so provided a quiet refuge to relax.  The reception staff were kind enough to allow a friend who was staying elsewhere to join me there for visits.  The hotel Wi-Fi, which is generally quite good, works somewhat less on the rooftop.  I looked into one of the hotel rooms and it was quite large and seemed well-appointed.  As someone who has travelled extensively, I believe this property provides everything one would want for a reasonable price, whether it be a private room or shared dorm, and highly recommend it.",50,506
…,50,506
"Great location in Tulum downtown, you can do everything walking or biking, suites are super clean, service was magnific, roof top is beautiful. The best option in Tulum if you want to have a pause from city vibes...",40,506
"Great customer service from the very start!! Basic, but clean rooms. Location is perfect to explore the town on foot. I was very impressed with this place because they worked with me when we unexpectedly had to cut our vacation short by a few days. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a beach resort, but their location, customer service and price makes up for that. We would definitely return to La Palmita in the future.",50,506
"Very central to everything Tulum, we walked everywhere, and biked to the beach which is a 10-15 min bike ride. The rates at the hotel were great. With great wifi in the room. Rooms are very spacious.  We stayed in the suite which had a kitchenette with big fridge.",40,506
"Good location, close to restaurants, grocery stores, shops, banks, and a gym.  Alexandra and Richard, the owners, are friendly and engaging.  The room was large with high ceilings and a patio with chairs and a small table.  Guests can refill water bottles from the water dispenser in the hallways.  Major attractions are within walking distance.  I highly recommend this hotel.",50,506
"as title says, plus a very friendly and helpful personnel (we almost became friends with Alexandra) and next to the best breakfast in Tulum (el Cielo). Ideal for walking aroun every calle and have your night drinks (it's close to the best bars of Tulum)",50,506
"Jose and Alexandra are extremely nice and helpful. If we returned late and needed towels or even tea, they are always helping with a smile. We had an almost unlimited supply of water, right next to our room. Alexandra even recommended a company for travel to chichen itza. The room had great facilities. A full kitchen and big fridge.  There's was no breakfast, even if we paid extra. Must take a cab to reach the beaches and Maya's ruins.",50,506
"Its been 18 years since we first visited Tulum. WOW, how things have changed. We come down every year or two and things have become quite the opposite of what we first relished in. Thanks to the fantastic staff and accommodations at Playa Canek, we felt like we were doing our best enjoy what Tulum was once to us....chill, pristine beauty, healthy food and vibes. Thanks to Gualberto, Marcello, Fernando(nice to see you and connect on the Euphamia Taco memories), Cayentano, Ambian, all the gals in the great houskeeping team, and everybody on staff at Canek. Oh, and a special thanks to the massage ladies on the beach, Sheri can't stop talking about another neck and shoulder rub!  Warm hospitality and a smile goes a long way. Congrats on a great team Bruno!!! Nice to meet you too!",50,507

"Would recommend this place, as a couple with a 3 year old it was a good location on the beach at a reasonable priced compared to some of its neighbours.  The 'garden room with balcony' was spacious, two double beds, nice bathroom and aircon 8pm-8am which was fine for us as we were out on the beautiful beach or visiting local attractions. Had a balcony with two deck chairs and hammock chair but we hardly used them. Was cleaned very day you wanted.   The hotel is relatively small, so doesn't matter where you are situation - the white sand is 30 seconds away. The use of Bali beds on beach is included in the price, all the way down the beach they can be anywhere between 40-200USD p/day. The bar was good for food and drink. Free breakfast was simple but fine for us: fruit, scrambled",50,507
" egg and toast included + drink.  Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops in walking distance. There's a little collection of upmarket food trucks/cocktail bar just up the road called Tulum Munchies which was good to stop off for a drink on the way in or out. Next door Zebras beach bar was good, had lots of 'cool' spots to relax, massive range of cocktails and decent food. Also a small park for children.  The staff at Canek were excellent with us as a family, from the two lads who ran reception, the bar and food staff and cleaners.  I usually discount tripadvisor reviews who name check staff (hypocritically I'm going to do it twice from this month travelling in Mexico) however Fernando who served the breakfast and sometimes worked the bar on the beach was really good with us - he made sure my son was well looked after at breakfast, had good local knowledge and was generally a nice lad.  The only negative could be parking, there are limited spots but the staff do sort a spot out and move the cars around to get your car in.   Would return to the hotel again if visiting Tulum",50,507
…,50,507
"Stayed at the hotel for a little more than one week and I must admit I was surprised in a very positive way. The hotel looks nice, the size makes it more friendly, the staff is beyond professional and welcoming, the food is good and the location is perfect (no noise from party places, beautiful beach with sunbeds always available). I felt safe and appreciated. A great experience that I recommend strongly for people looking for a chill, clean & human-oriented mindset.",10,507
"For our first time in Tulum, we found this hotel on the beach within our budget and had an amazing time! The personnel is adorable and very thoughtful, they really make you feel at home and that gives the whole experience extra points! We stayed 9 nights and would come again if we come in the area.  We felt in a bubble, enjoying the beautiful beach with comfortable beach beds, umbrellas at wish, the amazing massage girls and the bar/restaurant!  Because of the jet lag, we usually woke up around or before the sunrise and that was a show I was really happy to attend every single day!  The hotel is very close from really tasty restaurants to name a few: Corriente Cevicheria, La Taqueria - Tulum Tacos (some of the best tacos & burritos we had) and a 10min walk from a small grocery",10,507
" shop that had all the drinks, snacks and other convenience you need!  This hotel is a gem hidden in between very pricey hotels, and with very affordable prices! Highly recommend it if you are in the area!

"We had a really pleasant 2-night-stay at Mimosa during a trip around Yucatan. The room (a cozy teepee which had a very unique vibe to it) and public areas were all clean and the staff was super helpful and acommodating throughout our time here.  An additional plus was a really cool pool party with a belgian DJ one night, which we also enjoyed a lot. I can only recommend the Mimosa to everyone who is looking for an easy-going atmosphere on their trip to Tulum!",50,508
"By far one of the best hostels I’ve ever been !! The location is perfect, very close to the main street where you can find shops and restaurants and also take a bus to the beach. It is no problem for two european girls to walk home in the dark, we felt very safe. Spacious room with a very big shower. The whole hostel is in general really cute and clean. There is a nice pool and a very inviting bar.  But the cherry on top is definitely the staff, they were so friendly and helpful. They were always there to assist us and help us with anything we needed. It was very sad to leave after five days. As someone who works in hospitlity myself I had nothing to camplain about and would recommend it to my friends.",50,508
"I retired last year.  I was craving a return to the Mexican Hostel world of my college years.  I still wanted the hippies and adventurers, and the Spanish speakers, and the international tourists; but without compromising my safety as I'd done in my youth.    This fit the bill perfectly.  Jimmy, the owner, lives on site, and made me feel like a safe and honored guest.  Several employees quickly became our friends, mentors, and advocates.    The room was cleaner than my own house (I am a neat freak with maids).  Clean drinking water, fresh sheets, and air conditioning.  The shower was HOT and big enough for both me and my boyfriend.  The room was right on the pool, and I could fall out of bed into the pool and order breakfast from the chef, and a cocktail from Manny the",50,508
" bartender, at 9 AM.  The fully outfitted kitchen was ours to use most of the day, as was the beautiful outdoor dining room.  We spent a lot of time at the dining table, eating street food from the nearby vendors, and planning the next day's adventures, with the help of our fellow travelers and employees, and Jimmy.    There's an elevated veranda with wind and fans and futons, perfect for chilling with your kindle, or just drying off from the pool.  Also great for cocktails and conversation. I liked to slip up there at sunrise before my traveling companions awoke.  There are bikes for rent so you can peddle to the beach.  We did that a lot.  One day, we took the collectivo to the ruins and just walked all the way back. Other days, we took collectivos to various cenotes, both public and private.   We ate at a fancy restaurant nearby, ""El Pescador"", which was my favorite.  Fabulous Agua Chile and Mezcal cocktails.  We mostly ate at holes in the wall, and street vendors.  Also fabulous.  We liked to carry back food back from the street vendors, and eat in the outdoor dining room, whilst planning the next adventure.  I am so glad we didn't fall for the tourist traps on the beach.  Now that I am retired, I *could* afford them.  But this was certainly the better experience!   We hung with the locals.  We found the cool, hidden gems.  And Mimosa was our home base.  We'll be back.  Mimosa is our family in Tulum.",50,508

"This little gem was the best vacation I have ever taken!!!  The Staff including the owner were the best.  I met some of the best people from all over the globe!!!  Manu makes the best Margueritas!!!  Besides the tours I took, I basically stayed at the hotel, and walked around town.  Breakfast was delicious, and my room (double bed with private bath) was beautiful!!!  For the first time, I REALLY did not want to return home.  I will be visiting there again, Jimmy, Manu, Jose, Juan, love you guys and can't wait to see you again!!  ",50,508
"Since the arrival all the check in process was easy going, they welcomed us with a glass of water, perfect for the Tulum's warm weather. We stayed at the teepees, was really nice, the pool and the bar was great too.",50,508
"Really great experience. The staff was super nice, open to provide any kind of help. They are always open to a good talk and some fun. The way the bar is setup offer lots of opportunities to talk with other people I highly recommend this hostel!",50,508
"I really enjoyed my stay here. It’s the first time I’ve stayed at a hostel/hotel. My friend and I got our own room but all the common spaces are shared between hotel and hostel guests. We met Manu, the bartender/barista extraordinaire who took such good care of us. The drinks there were honestly better than most of the restaurant/bars we went to. He makes an excellent mojito   Aside from that, we got to meet other guests at the bar, pool, and meal areas. Everyone is so friendly and I got to hear stories from people from Germany, Canada, Croatia, and of course other parts of the US. It was a real familial vibe- definitely not one of the more party-centric hostels like Che.   I will say - there were also some issues. Our door was very difficult to lock and open with the key,",50,508
" even with some major effort. But our belongings were still quite secure. Secondly - a larger hang up- we booked the room believing that breakfast was complimentary. Apparently they changed this the week before we arrived and so you do have to pay for breakfast. This wasn’t communicated beforehand however and they only told us at check-in. Even so- I’m almost* glad not to have known in case it changed our lodging decision. That’s how much I enjoyed the company, environment, and of course the drinks.   I would definitely go again and would recommend to anyone who is looking to meet people during their traveling. I miss the staff and fellow guests already!",50,508
Very friendly and helpful staff and a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The hostel is also well presented and extremely clean throughout. Conveniently located within 3 mins walking distance from the ADO bus station. I will definitely stay at this hostel again when I return to Tulum!,50,509
"Ariché is a very nice hotel in the center of Tulum. It’s very close to the Main Street with restaurants and the bus, also the ADO bus station is only 5 mins away. We spontaneously called them for a room and even expended our stay as we liked the hotel and Tulum so much. It’s a perfect mixed of hotel and hostel, where you can meet other people but also can stay comfortably in your own room. We booked the suite and had a tree inside our room, which was our highlight after the hostel dog. It was very clean and the employees were super nice and helpful. All in all a very pleasant stay.",50,509
"Ariché is an ideal hostel for travelers working remotely or just looking for a relaxing place.  Everything is brand new, it's well-maintained, and the facilities are some of the best around.  There are three desks in the main area, and I hardly had any issues with the wifi except for in the dorms.  The owners Jeheil and Val are incredibly helpful and fun to hang out with.  They had some of the best recommendations in Mexico.  I loved the location because it's right in the middle of Tulum Centro near all the cheaper restaurants and bars, but it's not the place you are looking for if you want to be right near the beach.  It's about a 20-minute ride with a collectivo to get to Playa Paraiso, or you can take a taxi or bike.  The main area has a ton of space and a bar open all day. ",50,509
" They didn't serve food the last time I was there, but I know there were plans to start offering food.  The bathrooms are always clean, the showers come with shampoo and soap, and the dorms each have a light, plenty of outlets, and a locker big enough for at least a 55L backpack.  If you stay in any of the private rooms, you won't be disappointed.  They're some of the most beautiful I've stayed in.  Overall, Ariché is one of the best places I've stayed in Mexico.  I was there for about a month and a half.",50,509

"We really enjoyed our stay at Ariche.  This youthful hotel/hostel is high on design and hospitality.  We also liked the cheap happy hour beers and free breakfast.  The well-traveled and multilingual Argentinian staff puts on uptempo dance music and that creates a party vibe in the breezy patio/bar area.  We rented bikes to explore the beach, which we ultimately decided was not for us (a little too South Beach).  We spent our time instead at cenotes (Jaguar, Grand Cenote, Sac Ac Tuan and Calavera are best) which can be reached by bike or scooter rented from Ariche.  Gracias y grazie y xie xie nimen!",50,509
"I had a truly wonderful stay at Ariche hostel. The staff is very friendly, and ready to help you out with any request. Very clean rooms and facilities. Low prices for delicious drinks and quality food. The only thing I regret is that I did not book a stay for longer, and unfortunately the hostel was already fully booked for the additional days I wanted to stay in Tulum. On a personal note, I got along very well with Jehiel, one of the owners. I hope our paths cross again at some point.   In sum, this place comes highly recommended, 5 stars without a doubt!",50,509
"I started with one week and extended my stay for over a month in the dorm. It's owned by a very sweet and kind Mexican couple who always tried to make me feel comfortable – way beyond ""good service"". No matter what I got to struggle with, they were there to support me and made me feel at home away for home. Ariché is located in the centre of Tulum but still very quiet for all of you who try to stay away from too many people, music and party. It has a beautiful swimming pool, enough spaces to work at and a hammock for mid-day naps. Plus: They have the sweetest dog, Rufino, who's the cherry on the top. One of my best hostel experiences for a fair price! <3",50,509

"everything was perfect, this place is magical we did a bufo ceremony and stayed one night, this day we both died and were born again, now is the time to go on and take on life, we move forward from here with strenght and love",50,510
Really enjoyable stay in the centre of Tulum half way to the beach and half way to downtown. The rooms are cosy and clean and you really feel like you are sleeping in the jungle. Showers always had hot water which was nice. The only thing was the hotel was really difficult to get hold of so I missed a night due to the check in time stating it was only until 20.30 but the reception advised me the next day that it is manned 24/7. I wish I had known this so I had not missed a night that I booked. Apart from this my stay was great and I would recommend.,40,510
"It’s very cozy with a great energy. If you feel like to relax for a couple of days, this is your place. They offer also different ceremonies and therapy’s to dive more into you and become who you really are. I definitely come back.",50,510
"I did not stay at the hotel but did the ceremony twice. It is very healthy for the mind. Good clarity, nothing to be afraid of. The guides were safe, gentle, people and seemed unphased by everything that happened during the ceremony, which helped me stay calm and comfortable too.  I was a little concerned that it might be cheesy or overly commercial because of the location and some of the signs saying celebrities had been there, but it really doesn’t matter once you’re on the grounds. The atmosphere is very sweet, and the facilitators are so sincere and warm, there’s something real and good happening there for sure. If you can, take advantage of this opportunity. It’s really special. They could charge way more but it seems like they’re really just trying to be of service in the",50,510
" world, provide healing, and stay accessible. Do leave a few “buffer” days for yourself the way you might after an intense meditation retreat — don’t plan to go back to work, or to the airport, or a dance party — you’ll be hypersensitive for a while.",50,510
…,50,510
"The atmosphere was very jungle-like and had good energy. It was very peaceful and private, you couldn't feel that you were just next to the street. There was a nice pool and the gym was really cool! The staff was friendly (including the cat). The bar had good music and nice smoothies (try Meditación). The food was mediocre.  Bonus was that a big supermarket was just nearby. I also enjoyed the bufo ceremony. Felt safe and comfortable during it.",50,510
"All of my practices – yogic, tantric, shamanic, magick – I did for decades, lead me to this amazing therapy, to this enormous gift I was able and ready to receive. Yes, you can call this the great epiphany. Yes, it is like dying and seeing your true nature, and it is beautiful and perfect beyond anything anyone can ever describe… so much beauty, love and peace that are our true nature, are beyond words. For me, the Bufo ceremony was everything I ever wanted but didn’t know that it’s possible to get :) In 20 minutes of earth-time I saw the Creation, the One, the All-That-Is or however you want to call the magnificent life force that drives the Universe and creates all life. I saw its breathtaking beauty and felt my own being is as limitless as the Universe. I felt this enormously",50,510
" strong, indestructible force, emanating pure joy of creating and playing everlasting life…  … and then I became One with it - and at that moment, my heart exploded in pure unconditional love throughout the Universe. … the ecstasy of coming home, of becoming (again) who I truly am… ecstasy beyond anything I ever experienced.  When I got back to my body, I heard my mind telling me “This can not be real”, but the Truth I felt still connected to the One, is beyond any worldly truth - you KNOW this is the real you. I screamed from the top of my lungs and felt the dissolution of ego construct, this small, insignificant, insecure individual fighting against the cruel world… and the new Me was born, lying on the flor, crying and laughing at the same time. The New Me, loving this world and knowing everything is perfect. And yes, we are eternal and unbreakable :)   I feel like an earthquake shook all of my core believes and now I have a chance to make new ones. I see my mind jumping around and trying to hold to my old personal story, but the feeling of me exploding in unconditional love is so deeply embodied in me, that I don’t let it go back to old patterns of being miserable and alone, disconnected from the source. Now I know I am the Creator of my world. I am the One, same as you!  Before this experience I believed we were One – and now I KNOW we are One. I believed unconditional love is the heart of Creation and life – now I KNOW and feel unconditional love all around us, building the world. I believed I was the Creator of my reality - now I know that I create all of my world…  Now I know I don't need to change the world, I only need to change myself, and my new world will blossom around me. All I need to do is live my life joyfully and create beauty, enjoy this creation and be here, now, to witness this amazing reality.  There is no fear. Only life, creating and playing itself, blossoming in beauty.  This ceremony is an enormous gift to all who are prepared to become the One, to feel the Love, and to surrender to the great force of All-That-Is. It takes some courage to let go of ""yourself"" and I suppose it is a good idea to have a steady meditation practice, but also to have a facilitator you completely trust and feel safe with. I am grateful to Bufo Alvarius Sanctuary for providing amazing support for this experience  Thank you, Juan Luis, for your love and compassion  We are One!",50,510
Too expensive for what you get! Eventhou the host was friendly and helpful we did not enjoy our time in Posada Silver Inn. The room was primitive and simply not welcoming. The hotel is located close to a bar which played loud music till past midnight.,20,511
"We just got back from a week-long stay on Isla Mujeres at the Loma Bonita condo. My parents were staying at the property for three weeks and invited my wife and I to stay with them.  We stayed in unit 8C on the third floor of the building closest to the side road (there are three separate buildings which share a common area).  First, the view is awesome. It overlooks the pool and grounds of the property and of course the ocean looking west towards Cancun on the mainland.  You could also see the boats that populate the southern part of the ocean just off the island (Punta Sur) where the main section of snorkeling and scuba diving is located (MUSA and Manchones reef). The balcony is large enough to fit a circular table with four chairs, which was nice so our entire family could",40,512
" enjoy the scenery while eating or playing games.    The front grounds are well manicured and taken care of. The pool is a good size and, since it's not heated, is *very* refreshing on those hot days. I enjoyed it. There is also a shaded patio area which includes a table and chairs.  However, there were a limited number of sun-bathing chairs and they always seemed to be broken. I think a small investment in new chairs would go a long way (I believe this was brought up by a previous reviewer).  The unit had two good-sized bedrooms with accompanying bathrooms. My parents took the master bedroom which has the bathroom inside it. It faces west towards the front grounds and has a view of Cancun.  My wife and I had the east-facing bedroom, which looks across the island towards the Caribbean Sea.  The island is very narrow at this point so the ocean isn't far. This bedroom may not have the view of the master bedroom, but it gets much more breeze. The bathroom for our bedroom is located in the hall so it can be used by visitors to the condo.  The common living room has a large sofa which made it easy for the entire family to hang out there. We cooked several meals in the kitchen and dining area.  While I personally did not have contact with Jose, the on-site property manager, my father often talked to him whenever he had questions or needed something. My understanding is that he was very friendly and helpful. A common occurrence was refilling the drinking water - which I brought up from a storage area in an adjacent building. We kept track of the number of water containers and pay for at end of the stay.  The location of the condo is on the south side of the island, about a 3/4 mile from the south end Punta Sur. There are many beach clubs and restaurants up and down the western edge that are walkable, as well as some in La Gloria (small town area).  We would often wake up early and go for a run from the condo to the south end, then back up to La Gloria to make a circle of a couple miles.  One thing to remember is that restaurants in this area often close early, while the places in town tend to stay open later.  We enjoyed the quietness of this area after dark, however.  If you want to party, the north end is a short cab ride away.  Taxis are plentiful on the main road during daytime hours, and I'm sure Jose would call you one if you needed one at night.  As some reviewers have stated, the property is older, and this is reflected in some areas.  The appliances in the kitchen show signs of age, and we had small issues with the opening and closing the blinds in the back bedroom.  These, however, were small problems that did not take away from enjoying our stay overall.  We would stay at Loma Bonita again.",30,512

"La atención de la gerente es muy buena, las habitaciones muy bien decoradas y todo esta nuevo y funciona a la perfección, el precio bastante accesible y esta ubicado en una zona donde ya no se escucha ruido en la calle. EL único pero si es que pudiera ser, es que el baño no tiene puerta y si es algo incomodo sobre todo si no vas en plan de pareja. Pero fuera de eso hay solución y nos la pasamos de lo mas rico. Felicidades y que lo sigan conservando asi de limpio y arreglado.",50,514
"We booked this hotel through Expedia and when we found it, it was still under construction and definitely not ready to be booked. We walked in the lobby was still being worked on. The receptionist greeted us at a card table under the stairs. We asked her if the construction was going to stop and she yes in 20 minutes. We were very tired and once the room was ready we were looking forward to taking a nap. The room itself was nice except that there was no door on the bathroom. The toilet was open to the room. The windows had no glass or screens. There were wooden shutters though. Anyways we started to nap and then the construction started back up. It was very loud. My bf went back downstairs to see when it would end but the receptionist disappeared and it there was just a teenager",20,514
 and the construction crew there. We ended up leaving and Expedia refunded us but we had to find a different hotel.   I think it was unethical of this hotel to rent out rooms before they were ready to open and I wouldn't stay here again because of this.,40,514
We stayed one night at Lolos as a gracious gesture through facebook.My husband and I were celebrating our 30 th Wedding Aniversary this our 9th trip to Isla.The property is unlike any place we have stayed.Lolo has designed and participated in creating this unique artful abode.The room we stayed in is off the courtyard.Its a delightful mix of sculpture and color.Lolo is a wonderful hostess and her housekeeper is lovely .,50,515
"I had to cancel my trip due to the unprecedented circumstances in the UK and Europe (corona virus). Although it was pass the ‘free cancellation’ date, this hotel kindly agreed to waive the fee and allowed me to cancel the booking for free. It was really kind and understanding of them. If I go to Tulum in the future, I will definitely book this hotel again. Thank you, Casa Abanico!",50,516
"Everything is perfect. The staff is kind, the room is super clean, beautiful and comfy. There is a shared space to make your own meal or have a coffee with a view on the beautiful garden. It is a little paradise really close to everything.",50,516
Had a problem w a 3rd party website and the owners were kind enough to accommodate me.  This place is like a small apartment complex. Well maintained and quiet.  It’s towards the end of the Main Street/strip and less than 10 min walk from the ADO bus station which I recommend using for travel between large cities.,50,516
"We stayed 3 nights at Casa Abianco and loved every minute. The owners make you feel really comfortable and their beautiful dog Mango is always ready for a pat.   Short walk to the main street where  the best Burrito place is right at your doorstop (Burrito Amor)   Cenotes very close by as well and there are bikes to rent (free of charge).   They have free drinking water to refill your bottle with as well, so no need to keep buying water.   So much detail has gone into this place. We loved it.",50,516
"What a beautiful place. The owner was lovely and very generous to wait up late for me when I ended up getting hung up at customs because of cigars. LOL. I was almost heartbroken when I checked in not because it was bad, but because the ground were just so lovely and the room was lovely, and the bed was comfortable and the kitchen/common area was great and I was only staying one night! I seriously considered changing my plans so I could stay longer. My car was parked on the street and was fine through the night and they let me leave it there when I went diving the next day. They also stored by suitcase without a qualm or charge. I honestly can't think of a single critique other than the grounds are rock pathways that are a little hard to roll a suitcase on, but that isn't exactly",40,516

"The guest house is located a few blocks off the west end off the main drag, it is only a ten minute walk to restaurants and shops. The owners are super friendly and very helpful. My room was spotless and the bed was very comfy. I highly recommend stay here and if I am ever in Tulum again I will definitely stay here.",50,516
"This place was much more than I expected. But, I happened to need to work on my laptop a bit at night during my 4 night stay. They advertised free Wifi in the rooms online, and had signs at the hotel stating the sam. However, I was only able to get wifi twice for about 5 mins each. There was a solution to this though. Apparently the kitchen area that is on the second floor (and also a pretty cool setup!) has a decent Wifi signal there compared to the room I was in. This wasn't a major problem because I only needed it for a few minutes each night. The room was clean and comfortable, price was awesome, and the AC worked well. It is about 1/4 mile walk to get into the middle of the tourist action in town as the hotel is tucked away in a neighborhood a couple blocks west of the main",50,516
 avenue. I would stay again!,50,516
"Just AVOID this place.  Our room was nr. 1, right besides the reception, you could hear every word spoken and loud music coming from across the street till late night ours.  Room had a terrible smell, which never went away, there was only fan, no AC, window was facing to some disturbing inside view(see picture) and one of the window glasses was missing, had to close it with plastic to avoid some cockroaches coming in, other window was facing the hallway where everyone was passing by and again you could hear every single sound. It was dump, moldy, walls were dirty and towels from past century, couldn’t wait to get away from this horrible place.  Would night recommend to stay at any cost.",10,517
"Awful place. The floor was so dirty it turned our feet black walking around. The room windows only face to other inside areas so there was no ventilation. It was really damp, moldy and there was even a dirty lime slice in the room when we arrived. The staff who worked there were ok but the owner has anger problems and screamed at us and kicked us out early with no warning because we made a complaint.",10,517
So we booked the hotel expecting a comfortable stay in Tulum. However the moment we check in we did declare we were checking in earlier then they got confused. Another thing the room looked like run down dorms old facility and gosh the noise is unbelievable. We did our booking via booking.com for 6 nights we left the same night as we could not take the quality. The towels were run down and the shower pressure was too low. We asked for a refund and still have not recieved it its been over a week or so. I would not reccomend this hotel at all. The images on booking.com is so different from reality.,10,517
"Please avoid this hotel at all costs, I couldn’t travel due to COVID restrictions but they not only kept my money but also double charged my stay Also their customer service is pure useless Avoid at all costs                   ",10,517
"Located right next to the ADO bus station this small hotel is easy to get to and easy to bus out from. Colectivos were also easily accessible only steps away from the lobby. The main entrance area and waiting lobby is nice. They had bikes to rent but they were all out of use and needed “repaired”. The rooms are very small. The first room we were in the AC unit didn’t work so they moved us to another room where it did (which we were very happy for). However the sink in the bathroom leaked, and followed the groves in the floor to our bed side where the water pooled up. It was the only hotel where we had cockroaches in or bed or just in the room. Which I know is very common so we were surprised it was the only one. Overall it did the job and the staff was nice and it was in a good",30,517

"We stayed 3 nights in two different rooms. Many rooms had no windows and therefore bad indpode climate, as their couldnt get fresh air in the rooms. Some of the rooms dont have hot water. They match prises, and we got a room with air con for 600 pesos. Good value for the money. ",50,517
"We stayed two nights here and it was great. Having the pool was fantastic, especially as the beach has lots of seaweed. Great rooftop area as well. Room had a fridge but will need only cutlery etc if want to byo own food. Very central but quiet when inside. Felt very safe. Terrific staff highly recommend.",50,518
Had a lovely time here the place is quite small with a lovely roof area which we enjoyed with a couple of margaritas. The owner was lovely. The pool was good after a day at the beach very close to town bus stop and taxis ,40,518
"Although my wife and I only spent one night at the Casa Sofia, we would definitely book more nights on a return trip to Tulum.  The hotel was clean and the staff was both friendly and helpful.  The Casa Sofia is located just a few blocks from the bus station, which we used to travel to Valladolid.  The hotel is also a short walk to many restaurants. We arrived in Tulum in the late afternoon.  After we checked in, we walked to the Don Cafeto restaurant for supper and we enjoyed the food and service  enough to return the next morning for breakfast.   If you want to relax outdoors at the hotel, the Casa Sofia has a nice roof top terrace. It also has a small pool in the court yard area. (We did not use it.)  When we checked out of the hotel, there was almost a three hour gap until",50,518
 our bus departed.  The manager was very kind and allowed us to store our luggage so we would be free to explore Tulum before we left.  The Hotel Casa Sofia met our needs and we hope to return someday.,40,518

This accommodation is right in the centre and the perfect hideaway. It is the best value for the price. The rooms were spacious and clean the beds comfy and a little pool in the centre to cool down after a day of exploring. You will not get better for the money. Lovely traditional decor. If your looking for a reasonable priced hotel close to the centre do not look any further. The added bonus is the manager who is very nice and informative about the area. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment. ,50,518
"The view from outside certainly does not do this little gem justice!  It is in a great location just a short walk from the main street in Tulum so is easy to get to all the bars restaurants and shops; the rooms are a good size with a/c good showers and there is the bonus of a very nice small private pool. The staff are very helpful and charming, this is a great place to stay and at a fantastic price, highly recommended by me!",40,518
"The staff are amazing, the location is perfect! The rooms are great with air condition and good size bathroom.  Great rates and well worth the money for the location and walking distance from the main strip of Tulum's city centre.   Book it, short and sweet!",50,518
"Good value hotel - rooms approx 150$cad per night. Walking distance to tons of great resto’s in town. A bit of a distance to the beach though - need car or taxi.  Super friendly staff. Simple breakfast (toast, yogurt, waffles) included w coffee and tea. Well kept and clean hotel. ",40,518
I’m glad to report that Casa Sofia is still as fine a place to stay in Tulum as a year ago. My wife and I stayed at this charming small hotel on the way from Cancun to Xcalak for one night. Angel greeted us at the front door and got our luggage to our room promptly. The air conditioning worked very well and we were comfortable at all times. The breakfast was limited but very nice near the small pool and got us ready for the drive ahead.   This year Casa Sofia had added a locked parking lot just a minute’s walk away. Not a big change but better than parking on the street. Don’t be afraid of the barking dogs on the rooftops nearby; they make a lot of noise but don’t jump down (at least not in our experience). And they’re quiet at night when you’re trying to sleep!  Great spot.,40,518
"Clean. Staff.location.environment.culture.price  5+star! I barely leave reviews , but I took my time for this one. Exceptional customer service, sparkling clean, location is 5 min from beach, friendly environment, great food next to it (Palo santo) definitely recommend. Thank you Lupita & Enrique !!",50,519
"Super friendly and welcoming staff. Excellently convenient with the lending bicycles, free of charge - best way to get around Tulum. Located across from a huge supermarket. The overall experience was good, but with a few buts. The room was spacious and modern, but I missed basic amenities such as a dedicated nightlight, a hairdryer and a fridge. The decor was modern, but the naked lightbulbs hang in the height of my eyes, and I had to unscrew the bulbs to not be blinded all the time. The flooring is some sort of beige concrete, which dusts a lot - don’t drop your clothes on it. The roof top pool was lovely, but the area doubles as breakfast area, which means there are chairs and tables only, no sun beds. The breakfast was nice, but there was no menu - the waiter would ask what",30,519
"We‘ve stayed there two nights for about 1000 pesos - the room is very big, with two chairs, two tables, a fan, airco and a TV (though we didn’t use it).  The hosts are very friendly, they gave us plenty of tips about the Ruins, the beach, the cenotes and bike rentals!  The private bathroom includes a shower with hot water, but there’s really just 5 drops per minute coming of the shower head (also with cold water).. there‘s no toilet seat either, and it smells a bit muffy in the bathroom .. but they have hand soap and cloth hangers!  If you look for a simple accommodation for a good price, that’s where you wanna stay! ",40,520
We have just spent the last 4 nights at Posada 77 and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Liliana was so kind and welcoming and we were worried because our Spanish isn't very good but her English is perfect. She showed us pictures of all her favourite Cenotes and told us how to get there. The room was big and clean and it's situated a 5 minute walk from the supermarket and restaurants but it's quiet at night so you will get a good nights sleep. Thank you so much Liliana for making our stay so enjoyable we can't wait to come back,50,520
love Mexico so much even tho I was poorly the views are amazing the beach is so warm it's like paradise just dont go in summer because it gets so hot I I highly recommend British people go in our winter time,50,521
"If you're looking to be immersed in Tulums jungle environment, this is the place. You're staying in the jungle with limited access to power, internet, and AC. The property is behind an awesome restaurant, set back far enough from the party strip to not hear the noise. The rooms are basic with no bells and whistles. A place to sleep and shower.  Mosquitos abound, so be prepared. Mosquito nets and screens are provided, but you'll want bugspray for the day and citronella for the night.   If you're looking for hang time in the room, room service, daily maids - this is not it.",50,522
"The restaurant staff is super rude. A big fat no, avoid with all cost. Food was so so but pretty expensive but obviously you don't enjoy it at all if the staff members are acting like kids. With no reason. Horrible. Just go somewhere else in Hotel Zone",10,522
"This place is magical. I’m truly in love. The temazcal ceremony is the best part. So much healing, amazing energy here. The staff is genuinely sweet & welcoming. Food & drinks are refreshing & clean. Everything about this place is tulum. The ocean is 50 steps away from the rooms, you can’t get any better than this. If you want the full tulum experience I highly recommend Tunich.",50,522
"What we liked about the Tunich is the location. Just on the other side of the road of a free beach cove access. The food is delicous and the service was very friendly. Isma and Gio attended us kindly although we arrived at a high peak service hour.    There is a bike rental just across the road and it is a short ride to town and the ruins.   The price is a bit too steep for the room value and of course there is the street noise, but that seems to be Tulum.",40,522
"Great staff, wonderful atmosphere. Taking food to go across the street to the beach would be ideal for a beach picnic. (Maybe 100 steps away) Their long bar style table out front near the busy road is the perfect place to enjoy an iced coffee and people watch. We had bagels but they have lots of other items available that looked pretty good too.  Also, the board games and UNO were a nice touch while waiting for breakfast or afterwards while you finish your coffee. Thanks Gio! Definitely recommend Tunich.",50,522
"Tunich was such a beautiful place! My stay there was perfect, I cannot wait to return! The rooms were great the bed was comfortable, the food was so good. The complimentary breakfast was a great start to our day. Beach access is only a few feet away to a quiet little beach area. I participated in the temazcal ceremony and that was a wonderful experience!  Blaine and his staff are absolutely amazing.",50,522
"If your looking for a place to do temazcal or Bufo medicine ceremony, I wouldn’t look further. I am so grateful for meeting this amazing shaman Isaac  and  the owner of the hotel Blane. It was my first ceremony and couldn’t ask better people to be there for it. They make you feel safe and you really feel taken care of. I had  a beautiful private ceremony right on the beach during sunrise. No words to describe it really! definitely going back when next time in Tulum.   Btw their breakfast is delicious too with many options to choose from :-)",50,522
"We had a great time. The host and all the staff made us feel like home. Perfect breakfast, amazing cocktails and the muffins are the one thing that you can not miss. The sea is just across the street and if you can enjoy the sun rising.",50,522
"If you are looking for an incredible spiritual journey while in Tulum, I highly recommend Tunich's Temazcal.   I have done this practice at other places in Tulum and they did not compete with my experience here. Not only was it the most authentic practice I have had but it also was a fraction of the cost of other places in Tulum.   An authentic, shaman lead ceremony worth exploring!! Give it a try!!",50,522
"A dream come true! Phenomenal health food restaurant with breakfast included in the stay. Natural jungle setting. Affordable accommodations across the street from the beach, whereas other lodging in the area is much more highly priced. What great value - what a treat!",50,522
Not  a safe place . The items are stolen from the room. So i will certainly not encourage anyone to stay at such a crime location. I also heard similar issues from other neighbours staying at the same place,10,523
"When i asked the manager if they allow pets, they replied to me: “EXCUSE ME” (yes with capital letters) we don’t take pets, next day I saw another guest staying at the hotel with a chihuahua dog!! I don’t get it! why they said yes to her and not to me? They didn’t care what kind of dog, size, bread.",30,523
"I recently stayed at this property for a 7 night stay. There are so many great things to say about this hotel!! The room was spotless, with everything I needed for my stay including cold bottled water, a small fridge, bath products, cozy towels and linens. The room had AC which is a game changer for sleeping at night.   The hotel staff is INCREDIBLE! Super friendly, helpful, kind, and knowledgable about all things Tulum. You can rent a reliable bike to get around town. The pool is super clean and they have an outdoor shower you can use to rinse off afterwards. They also provide pool side towels, you just need to ask.   They have a locked gate so only hotel guest and staff are coming/going and they have a small parking lot out front if you have a car.

"This property has been my favorite of the 3 I have stayed in Tulum. It is tucked away in the quiet, yet up and coming neighborhood, La Veleta. It's about a 15-20 min walk to the main street and much quicker on a bike/scooter. The property only has 6 units which I loved and the stay comes with complimentary breakfast (eggs, juice, fruit, coffee, etc.) The property has nice big rooms, a lovely balcony to do work, clean bathrooms, and a nice big rainfall shower.   I liked this property because I didn't want to stay in the overcrowded city center/hotel zone, yet if I wanted to get to the beach, I was only a 15 min taxi/scooter ride away. To make your stay easier, I would highly recommended renting a scooter. That way you are on your own time and you don't get stuck in traffic.  ",50,523

Hope to come back soon!",50,523

"Beautiful little slice of land in the jungle. Very simple and clean cabanas, great bathroom block, large showers. Only problem was the mosquitoes which found there way past the net (it was abit difficult for me anyway, to keep the net all the way around the bed). Also could improve the breakfast, only toast and coffee. Kitchen and bikes free for guest use was great!! Clean pool and great bird watching around the property.",40,524
"So friendly, great value.  Clean.  Quiet location. Free bikes if you leave an ID.   The only thing to improve would be free breakfast which is just toast, jam, coffee.  There were not many people around - no social scene.  ",50,524
"Pros: big clean rooms Clean bathrooms with hot water Pool is lovely Breakfast was simple but we really enjoyed it  Bed was super comfy Free bikes!  Staff were super friendly and helpful  Cons: A little far from the beach and a bit far from town Its a tent/yurt so you can hear outside very clearly  Overall a really excellent quiet spot in nature, would highly recommend.",50,524
"The room we stayed at was adequate, nothing special, but the whole area of Joy Tulum is very nice! The pool area is great to relax at in the heat. It is also pretty close to the center of town; just a 5 min cycle. And they give bikes for free! ",40,524
We came late at night from the airport. The hotel did a very nice job to arrange a taxi for us since we didn't knew if we where able to go by bus.   The check in was very fast and secure. The front desk staff was very polite and welcoming.   It was so cold when we arrived so we asked for extra blanket and we got it. There was no problem in that.   The bed and pillows where comfy. Yet the room was very simple we had everything we needed. It was big for our luggage. We experienced a rain shower and the bungalow got really humid. Thats not the hotels fault though.

"Joy Tulum was a wonderful experience. The rooms are basic (although you are camping!) but theres enough space for everything you need.   The bathrooms are shared, however they are SUPER clean, and we never had to wait for the bathroom or shower.   The pool area is wonderful for a morning relaxation if you want the sun, or a perfect way to cool down in the shade in the afternoon.   The free bikes are necessary and the best way to get around as the location is a little bit out of the way from the main downtown. Dont let this deter you, its not a negative!   Only one thing I think they could improve is the mattresses in the cabins. Both our beds had a big dip in the middle. I know we are camping, so what expectations can you have!? But flipping mattress from time to time would help",50,524

"STAY AWAY!!!  Stayed at the Mistiq Tulum apartment complex with my husband from March 25-28th. Nice place aside from getting robbed at gun point the morning of our departure to cancun on the 28th. There were four of us having breakfast at around 10AM at La Baguette Bistro on the outside terrace, this is part of the complex front side. We had all sat down, but hubby had to go talk to front desk regarding a friend’s EarPods that were left behind. He came back and sat down with us, about 5-8 min later a Mexican with a hat and medical mask comes right up to my husband with a gun saying “to give his watch or you die”  We were all in disbelief and in shock, there were staff and people all around us and No one did NOTHING!!!  Took about 5 minutes for staff to come talk to us, they",10,525
" didn’t even call the police. The Mistiq manager and the unit manager (Hector & Carolina) came out and asked what happened, we told them and they  asked what kind of watch?

You would think they would at least warn us or even post it at the Airbnb, guess business is more important than customers safety for them!  This was definitely an inside job, they all work together I wouldn’t TRUST anyone there, my husband was tagged and made a target. The guy knew exactly what he was looking for when he pointed a gun at us.  We usually read reviews before we go to any places but my husband has been before with a bunch of friends last year. Not sure if they were just lucky, but reading back on reviews now it’s seems it’s been happening a lot there. Even units getting broken into and families tied up. Definitely not a safe place for anyone!  Don’t be fooled by there cameras and security guards that have flashlights for protection",10,525

They will rent you an apartment and you will show up and its not available. Happened to me and my friends and apparently is a consistent problem. Dont yourself a favor and dont rent there. No support but a shrug and some excuse that the reservation system is not working.,10,525
"IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE A ZERO I WOULD. Stay LITERALLY  anywhere else….  During our stay while we were asleep someone from the hotel broke into our unit and stole our belongings. We have proof of when they came into our unit. The code was never changed and no help was ever given. We literally had to sleep with a chair in front of our door the rest of the time so we would hear it if it opened…. The security team is in on it 100% as well as the rest of the hotel. They never provided security camera footage to us and we will never get compensated. Oven was broken, ant problem, etc. the list goes on. This is not the first time this happened. Read the other reviews",50,525
"This place looks nice, however there’s no management whatsoever. During the weekend our unit was attacked, our door broken  by a gang, we were beaten (I suffered severe trauma in the head needing scalp stitches and an MRI), we were kicked, held at gun point and all our stuff stolen (over $15k of possessions and electronics). Police says the internal security was involved. Management originally promised to take care of the problem and provide reparations after the robbery. Days later they claimed it was not their fault and we basically were left in shambles with no money, no IDs, no electronics. Nothing. Management will lie, promise and deceive counting that as a tourist you will eventually leave. This is a poisoned apple. Stay away if you care about your life. Pool is not",20,525

Staff is also very friendly and accommodating and room rates are a great value for such a premium location.  Note that accommodations are very rustic, so don’t expect the amenities of a typical beach resort or chain hotel, but in my book that only added to the charm.",50,526
"Located in the national park which is a beautiful area in Tulum but quite far from Tulum life (need to get a taxi which is gonna ask you crazy money for the ride because you’re a tourist)  Accommodations could offer more! No furniture at all in the room (no closet, no mirror, one very small and not shiny light only, no iron, no air dryer, no freezer, no AC - pretexting it’s for the ecology).  Forget the wifi (there is but the signal is zero).  The beach is beautiful tho, nice sunbeds, nice service from the beach guy.  Sorry but the receptionist was not very helpful, knowing nothing about Tulum.  I would rather save 250$/night and go camping!",30,526
Playa Esperanza is the perfect place to stay on the beach of Tulum for a chill and laid back experience. You can hear the waves when you sleep and wake up with the sunrise :) The food was delicious as well!,50,526
This was one of my favorite places in all of Mexico. The rooms are right by the beach and there is an outdoor shower. The food is really great and there's also a bar. The staff was super friendly and helped with all our queries. Would highly recommend staying here.,50,526
We came to playa Parisco and stopped in for the day.  500 min pesos and you can use their chairs for free.  Best chicken burrito we have had since we got to Mexico.  Great service and great place to hang for the day at the beach.  ,50,526
Came for the day with beach friends only one server and food took a long time and was served cold stick with cold dishes  Servicio added to bill so no need for extra tips  The beach is amazing drinks good not too expensive don’t know that we return ,40,526
"We booked 3 rooms in this hotel for May 2019. When we arrived, it was very different than the pictures. The rooms are super dark and small, the mosquito nets of the beds and the windows have many holes, hence there are many insects inside. There was an iguana in our room so they changed the room. We could not sleep because of the noise as there are no proper windows. The showers are too dark that we needed to put candles and flashes of phones around to shower. The beach had crazy amount of seaweeds so we couldn't use the beach at all and we were not offered any compensation for that (even 1 drink to show the good will or a warning message in advance about the situation). If I wanted a real jungle experience, I would have got a tent and pay much less than this hotel. All we paid",10,526

This hotel was good for the price! The construction nearby wasn’t as loud or noticeable as we thought it would be. I deducted a star because I thought the customer service at the front desk could have been better. Our favorite part of the stay was the rooftop bar and pool. The bartender Julio was awesome. He made the best drinks and was so fun to talk to. We will be back!,40,527
"The staff was phenomenal. So helpful and kind. They were super responsive. They were great and accommodating. Helped in so many different ways. This is more to do with other aspects.  While I understand being able to hear street noises, we were treated to a full rock concert right under our room, on a Sunday night. Amplifier and all. Went on for 3+ hours. Absolutely horrible. The band was good, just entirely inappropriate. Even if it were at the restaurant next door- not sure if it is a part of the hotel. They hotel should represent the guests and maybe an amplified concert with paper thin walls that vibrates a guests room is something that should have been complained about - but the hotel. Or not booked if this was Hotel Blanco. I wanted to cry. It was so absolutely horrible to",20,527

The wifi in our room went out but thankfully I could piggy back on to another room. NBD and no wash cloths, so we were told to buy our own.  But if you’re not okay risking your sleep for a possible concert, I would pass. I thought it would end at 10, but no. They kept going.   I sobbed. I am so tired as I write this, they will not stop. I get Tulum is a young environment, I’m 29. Not ancient but this is just awful. Tulum may be a party place, but not underneath a hotel, outside, amplified. I took sleeping pills, nothing can put me to sleep with this.   I did not pay for this. Had I known, I would have paid 3x for another place. This was just a horrible night. And it’s been loud the past 2 nights. Well, 2 nights to go. Pray for us.  I just want a solid 6-7 hours of sleep. Can someone make this stop. I’ll pay you to unplug the amps or sound proof the walls.",50,527

The internet photos do not reflect the true nature of this hotel  1) pool filthy on the edges and cloudy water  2) complete ignorance when asking for extra beach towels and bathroom towels - the girl on reception was stubborn and then downright rude  3) construction site going on right next to the hotel  The noise in the morning started from 7 am !!!! 4) tried to change rooms but the staff kept saying no availability for more than one night - that’s highly doubtful as the room I changed into had no one staying the following evening …….. nice trick that one  5) mattresses and pillows awful - very hard and not comfortable  5) first floor room 115 shower and sewerage blocked so absolutely stank of sewerage smells  6) miles away from the beach - but anyway they were covered in,10,527

We find a another hotel after the first night at Posada 06, and without the opportunity to get the money back for the remaining nights. This is not a hotel, but a 1 star hostel.",10,528
"This review is not about my stay but about the hotel management, specifically the owners wife Sharon who is also the reservation manager.  I don't know how the hotel is to stay because we were nearly ripped off at check in - see invoice attached.  The agreed upon total was supposed to be for 5 nights split between their 2 hotels, other El Nido, Holbox.  Since we asked to swap 2 nights in Tulum due to weather the owners request we pay an additional $150 for the nights in Tulum and as agreed upon in writing forfeit 2 nights in Holbox, we were asked to pay the total up front - strange since she already had my credit card and agreement for the first 4 nights.    When we arrived we were presented with the invoice totaling $1,030.44 USD or $415/night USD plus tax.  When we showed the",10,528
" email agreement the front desk rep called Sharon and she told him ""just charge them that"".  When we asked them to handwrite on the agreement that is was for 5 nights to clarify he said ""we can't do that""    We ultimately had to walk as by paying and signing that invoice it would have given them the legal right to charge us over $1k for 2 nights, plus the original amount of almost $900 USD.  Totally incorrect and we want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but on paper this is as it appears - unethical.  We were ultimately forced to walk and to leave the next day for Holbox or forfeit all of our deposit. When we arrived in Holobox, the owner Franceso acknowledged that we were charge incorrectly but did not apologize for his staff and wife's actions - zero apology.  I will tell you that the hotel in Holbox is beautiful, but that's it, no hospitality, far from town nothing on site and they nickel and dime you for everything - not a luxury experience",50,528

"I found myself with some extra time in Mexico before returning to the US, in light of the CV thing, and I came across this little gem in looking around Tulum one morning. An oasis to come back to at the end of the day, very simple, but stylish, and in a perfect location; just on the edge of all the hubbub. Only one complaint, and it is minor, is that they could try and soften up the towels. The staff were all great too, in particular Walter, who provided some great advice on places to go and things to do. I'll definitely plan to stay at Posada 06 on a return trip to Tulum. ",50,528
"We loved making this hotel our home base for our week long adventure in Tulum. It was clean, safe, comfortable and had great food. The staff were amazing and Walter even took the time to share a few day trip ideas with us. I would definitely recommend a stay here. ",50,528
"We thoroughly enjoyed our 9 nights at Hotel Posada. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the street and enjoyed the privacy and view that it gave us. Our daily breakfast included coffee, fresh fruit (and juice), yogurt and typically some type of eggs. After exploring Tulum and seeing other hotel options we were very glad to have booked our stay here. The staff was very helpful and friendly and our room was always spotless upon our return from exploring. The pool was much better than we anticipated (based on other reviews). We found it perfect for cooling off and if you go at the right time you can lay on the side and get some sun (granted we were only two people).  We didn’t see anyone else use the pool.   The other great thing about this hotel is its location. We were a",50,528
 block from the Main Street in Tulum and a short walk to some of the best taco places around. The beach road and grocery stores are all close as well. We were able to rent bikes from the hotel daily and get where we needed to go. It can be hard to find bike rentals after the early morning so this saved us a lot of hassle.   We would definitely recommend staying here if you come to Tulum. All the good (affordable) food is in the town and the beach is a moderate bike ride away. If you can get room 15 it’s fantastic.,50,528

"Hotel Posada 06 in Tulum is perfectly located just one block from the main part of town. 24/7 security makes it safe also.  The staff couldn’t have been friendlier here and extremely helpful to a Mexican novice like myself ... Julio and Walter were simply amazingly happy and helpful hosts.  The breakfast staff were lovely with an ample a la carte breakfast of eggs, salads, toast and cake along with coffee and juice.  Upon arrival I was disappointed with the economy room facing the main road. It was extremely basic, noisy, very small, the bed was hard and with the shower pretty much in the studio room.  Not worth the money I paid . However ...  Not happy, I enquired at reception for the chance of an upgrade to the superior room. The staff were extremely helpful and for only",50,528
We were very pleased with our experience at El Paraiso! Every person we encountered was extremely accommodating. They gave us great recommendations for activities and food and even provided bikes and a bike lock for us to get to some of these places.  We mainly communicated via WhatsApp and everyone was really responsive. Oh and did I mention the free breakfast they provide every day? A nice little touch . I would certainly stay here again should I return to Tulum!,50,529
"This review is overdue. I stayed at El Paraiso Hotel with 2 girlfriends in December over the holidays. We found the property on Tripadvisor and from the reviews/their social media it looked decent. We really cared about staying on the beach for easy access during the day. There's a ton I wish we knew prior to visiting Tulum so I'm happy to share here.   Our stay at El Paraiso Hotel was 5 nights long. In total we paid $3,295 ($659/night). For a room with 2 double beds, this was on the higher end of our budget, but our group figured it would be worth it to stay on the beach out of convenience. When we arrived at the hotel, everything looked decent.   Our first full day at the hotel we decided to stay at the hotels beach club. When we went out to get chairs, we were underwhelmed by",20,529
" the set-up. It wasn't luxurious or relaxing and was loud. Also, we weren't allowed to have more than one beach bed per a room, however, we were 3 guests and only 2 people fit on a bed. This was disappointing and of course not relaxing for all. We also ordered lunch and the food was not great at all. After this beach day, we decided this beach club/experience was not at all what we were looking for and made beach club reservations at other places for the rest of our stay.   A few days into our stay, a family with many children came to the hotel. Their rooms were situated on either side of ours. The family and children were outside each morning before 8am screaming and being completely inconsiderate of other guests. While I understand this is not the property's fault, they should've done a better job managing these guests or asked them to leave. We ended up staying out longer each day just to be away from the property and relax.   Next our shower stopped working/broke. The pressure the entire time we were there wasn't great and the shower head was quite janky (just a white pipe sticking out of the wall with a shower head attached). El Paraiso was kind enough to let us use the room next door to shower, however, it was an inconvenience. At that point we didn't want to switch rooms as all of our stuff was unpacked.   Lastly the most unfortunate of incidents during our stay... we found 2 cockroaches in our room towards the end of our stay. The property claimed they were fumigating outside and the cock roaches tend to go inside after they spray. I do not understand why a property would spray while guests are present knowing that the cock roaches may enter the room. The maintenance came and removed them as soon as we called, but it was quite unsettling. I totally understand we were in the jungle, but they must be able to prevent insects inside in some capacity.   Overall the staff was very kind and welcoming. The only nice features of the hotel was the complimentary breakfast (which wasn't that great, but nice to not have to spend money on another meal) and the ""concierge"" aka the front desk contact via Whatsapp. It was nice to easily call a taxi when needed.   When I shared all of these complaints with the property, they wouldn't do anything other than offer us free massages and a discount upon our next stay... we will never be staying here again. At the end of the day, we wanted something back (even if it was 1 night back) for all of these inconveniences. Beware as they charge in full upon arrival.   The amount we paid for this hotel was nowhere near worth it. We so wish we went above our budget and splurged on one of the nicer hotels (such as Papaya Playa, Selina, Azulik, Nomade, etc). At the end of the day, the hotels that were more money would've been worth it as we ended up paying for beach clubs every other day of our stay. All of the nicer hotels have these beach clubs included as part of your stay there.   I also want to call out that I stayed in Tulum for 2 additional weeks after my stay at El Paraiso Hotel. I stayed in an Airbnb apartment near town and then the Aloft Hotel right near the beach strip. BOTH of these accommodations were significantly better than El Paraiso Hotel.   We made the best of our stay, but want others to be aware of the situation at this property. I'd definitely return to Tulum, but I'm staying at a nicer property or the Aloft (which was great by the way).",50,529

The room was fantastic with working A/C, daily room cleaning, and big comfy beds.  Not to mention that the beach was perfect! Thanks El Paraiso!",50,529
"We’ve come to El Paraiso Tulum on two separate occasions and both were amazing experiences. The staff is very attentive and makes sure you are very comfortable. They are very good with setting up taxi’s for guests. The beach club is a mere 80 second walk from the guest rooms and they have great food… though the drinks could be a bit stronger. The rooms are quaint but very nice. The best part was the daily breakfast and uncanny customer service (WhatsApp friendly). All in all an incredible property with amazing staff, security, and customer service. My only complaint is no ATM on site, this would make El Paraiso Tulum even better. But besides that, it was amazing. A special thanks to Abril for going out of her way to make our stay even better!",10,529

I am currently undergoing medical and dental appointments to try and save my teeth. I may have to get fake implant teeth now and I’m an actor in New York City.   Absolutely unacceptable behavior and failure to assist their guests in great times of need and emergency situations. That is not how you treat your human family.  Hostel is a joke, pretty much run by “grown-up” children. They only care about partying and scamming guests for tours that they charge extra for to make money.   Also, no hot water.

You are forced to pay 300 mxp for a day which is far more than what you would pay for the same bikes if you were to rent them in Tulum town. This is the kind of thing that a hotel of this calibre should be allowing guests to use for free.  Service is very poor particularly poor in the restaurant.

Yes, there are boats right in front of the beach and you get occasional petrol smell. Yes, the bungalows do no offer much privacy and are more concentrated than appear on the photos.

Wide range of choices and generally found everything tasty and enjoyable albeit expensive. Chefs were open to accommodating special requests to cook for our toddler, which was appreciated. It would be nice to have more fruits on the menu. Supermarkets are crammed with watermelons, coconuts, papayas, pineapples - why more fruit bowl and smoothie options aren’t on the menu is perplexing. Dinner choices were more limited, which brings me to the next point.   Location. It is far from everything. There are two or three good restaurants within walking distance (15-20 minutes). Japanese Kogure was our favourite. For anything else you either need to drive or take a taxi (or cycle in the night along a small busy road). Taxi would cost you at least $10 to downtown and at least $35 one way to Tulum beach places. If you rent a car, as we did later, note you would also have to to pay for parking in Tulum beach (typically $10).  Service. Our deepest source of frustration, however, was the service, which ranged from inconsistent to non-existent. There is no hint of hospitality, no one is friendly and no one tries to make you feel welcome. Whether at the beach club, housekeeping or anything else, we had to repeat every request at least twice to get any tangible results. I have countless examples which I won’t bother putting here. Poor communication, long lead times and poor attitude all around. It was our first time in Tulum and concierge were generally clueless about helping us with tips and figuring out what to do. The restaurant kept running out of food items, e.g. tortilla chips and sparkling water! What they were excellent at is to try to charge you and here I agree with Shoeman’s review. Whatever the service, 15% tip is by default and then they come up with various ideas how to charge extra. One waiter implied there is a card transaction fee of 3% which means I need to leave 18% tip. Another claimed that the tips go to the overall pool and I should leave another 10-15% for him. Final straw was when they wanted to charge us for 2 broken glasses in the room (claiming we broke 4). Gosh, we just spent over $6k in your hotel - is this really a good idea?! What, these were Venetian glasses?!   Overall, it is a decent place saved by the beauty of the nature and the setting. But the service almost ruined our impression of Tulum until we discovered that good service there exists (just try Ziggy’s or Fresco for breakfast, or Hartwood and Kitchen Table for dinner). So if we come back, we are not staying at Kai. For the price you pay, I am sure you can get something a lot better elsewhere.",30,534

"I decided to go all out and spend nearly $1,000 a night on the best sea view suite at the resort after reading lots of good reviews. To say i was shocked when shown to a little room with a sea view if you looked down a street past lots of people looking back at you is an understatement. I felt sorry for the young man checking us in who had made us pay in 7 instalments because their card machine would not take large amounts. They made sure we paid the full amount before showing us the room. We were constantly treated as if we would run off owing a few dollars like we were staying in a cheap hostel. You can not charge anything in the restaurant to your room and if you rent bikes they will chase you every couple of hours if you do not have enough cash. Chasing for money was the",50,534

"We thought this was a lovey hotel, nice beach minimal jungle decor and lovely staff. Breakfast was also good with lots of options. The location was a bit challenging for the length of time we stayed so we had to rent a car, it was realistically too far from the beach and at the far end of town so we needed to go further out in car/taxi once we’d been to the neighbourhood restaurants (however they were great! See my other reviews for thoughts)   The only other comment is the pool, the seaweed in Tulum was really bad so we would have benefited from a slightly more luxurious pool with day beds/sun loungers. They had some deck style chairs but not something you’d hang around in/by all day. It just felt a bit outdated and although we saw it get cleaned every day it did look a bit",40,535

The rooms have an excellent decor and the ambience is very relaxing, you can spend a full day there without even realizing! We didn’t managed to go for the spa treatments, but we’ll make it next time!  Miss you all and we can’t wait to go back there again! ",40,535
"The hotel is very aesthetic, and the rooms are nicely presented with Tulum style decorations, and are big and spacious and have air conditioning.   The pool in the middle of the hotel is also a great feature, but a bit dated with a crack in the middle. The hotel had a problem with its boiler and water supply during our stay.   The shower is not reliable and runs hot and cold sporadically. One evening the water stopped working altogether. We complained to the reception and had to wait for hours outside our room as the water stopped working in our flat and we were late for our dinner reservations. The staff were unhelpful and seemed to be aware of the problem for our room, but didn’t offer us an alternate room or another solution apart from just waiting for us to leave. The",50,535
 manager was never there and the junior staff were unable to find a solution by themselves (change our room).  They seemed to take our complaint personally and ignored us for the rest of our 3 day stay.   Breakfast (which was included) was a simple Mexican menu but very nice. The juice tasted very watered down though.,10,535

A special shot out to Anola and Daniel for being so helpful and thoughtful every day with our requests given our large group size. The SPA there is truly one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life.",50,535
"Jungle Chic meets Sophisticated Bohemian, seriously relaxing place!  Quiet, clean, polite - not crowded, just what you expect from a Tulum vacation.  Walking distance to other places - Don’t expect too much excursions or information about where to go from front desk tho, they are about unplugging",50,535
"This quaint boutique hotel is well located for your Tulum visit.  The star rating is appropriate, though some may be way more critical.  The staff and proprietor Richard are the best part because they are so warm and helpful.   I would definitely stay here again on a future trip.  Thank you for the great experience.",50,536
We stayed at the Mayan Monkey in Tulum which was a 5 minute walk away from Teetotum and the attached Lola Cafe. We walked to Lola Cafe EVERY DAY for coffee and breakfast. It was SO good. Highly recommend.,50,536
"We ended up spending a total of five nights at Teetotum due to a change in travel plans caused by Hurricane Zeta.  This is a cool little hotel with a great owner and staff.  It's conveniently located so you can walk to downtown eating places and shops and it is a quick drive to the beautiful public beach.  The room was large, there was plenty of hot water and the AC worked great.  The best part of our stay was the people.  Richard, the owner, was very helpful and fun to talk to.  And the restaurant staff was hardworking and friendly.  We were treated to a mini magic show one night by one of the staff.  When we checked out to head home I felt like I was leaving family behind!  This will be our go to spot whenever we are in Tulum!",50,536
"Richard and staff are awesome. They make sure to take care of guests and their needs. I booked this hotel because it has a 5 star rating on TripAdvisor while being inexpensive compared to other hotels. I would say it lived up to that rating. Also, this stay is during the whole pandemic and I'll say they're ensuring safety of guests and proper checks were in place before entering the facility.   The hotel is in between the main town and the beach. They have free bikes available for the guests. The hotel itself has a relaxed vibe and the restaurant has very good breakfast and dinner selections. Plus a really good happy hour. It's a great place to relax at after spending a full day at the beach. We will definitely come back and stay again.",50,536
"I visited Tulum las week and stayed here at Teetotum, loved the room I took on the second floor, it has a/c. They have a big patio full of plants and hammocks, roof top, free bikes and excellent high speed wifi with comfortable knocks all over. Perfect for digital nomads like myself. Will stay again as they offered 10% off for repeat visits!",50,536
"Large, lush garden courtyard and deck, with plenty of space for social distancing. Great open air restaurant and Mezcal Bar! Spacious, clean rooms. Everything is new! Modern, minimal design. Relaxed, low key atmosphere. Super friendly, helpful staff provides hand sanitizers, public areas are cleaned after use. Best location on the road to the beach and close to town. Free bikes and pool. Best Fish Tacos!",50,536
"Teetotum has an cute, eclectic atmosphere complete with plants, fun pops of colour and the lovely dog in residence: Dahli.   The restaurant serves delicious food with an amazing 25 peso taco Tuesday. AND they have a daily happy hour from 5-8pm. It really doesn't get any better than this for value to quality folks! Their house made habanero salsa is so amazing, I am considering asking them to bottle some up for me as a gift. But be warned- it's picante!  They're right on the road to the beach, so whether you're biking or driving, you can park right next to it and fuel up before hitting the waves!  The owner is the sweetest man named Richard and he'll make you feel right at home at his chic little boutique hotel. Make sure you check out the roof spot upstairs and catch some rays",50,536

"We stayed at a hotel down the road and found oursevles eating at Teetotum most of the time. Lovely staff, great service and great food. Everything is always available (you go tp other restaurants and they say they have run out of items). The food and produce is fresh and so well cooked and presented. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito (should be for two people!) and the tacos - best we had in Tulum! Such a lovely relaxed atmosphere too.",50,536
They do 60 min full body massages for $35. They have happy hour all day. The food was AMAZING. My favorite flavors of my trip. Get the pork tacos and ceviche. Staff is so sweet. The ambiance is perfect for photos. Bed cabanas on the beach. Its a must see!,50,537
"We booked a room for a week and checked in first night, so far so good. We went out for dinner and when we returned to our room there were cockroaches everywhere! Huge cockroaches, at least 20 we counted.. We called the staff to help us out find a solution. They were not able to provide us with another room that night and we were not going to sleep in that room, so we had to take all our stuff and run out at 23:00, finding another hotel room was super difficult at that time of the night. We came back next day to complain to management. The let us check out but they charged us 150USD for that night when we didn't even slept in that room!",10,537
"The hotel is right on the beach, and the beach beds are just perfect!   The pool is - when turned on - very nice! The cleaning personel and the guards are friendly, as are the beach bar staff.  But from there... First of all, the place was expensive, but the room.. seriously.. we were eating by mosquitoes every night, the aircondition was to small to cool the room - probably because the roof wasn't sealed and there were cracks and holes in the floor, which gave free entrance to both cockroaches and even a black scorpion one of the nights. On top it was very noisy 24-7, probably from the A/C.  The hotel was a ghost town. We were the only one staying there for 6 nights even though neighbourgh hotels were fully booked, and we ""talked"" to the hotel via the booking.com chat. No one",20,537
" came to greet us or make us feel welcome.  The hotel is located quite south and all taxies have fixed prices. That means going anywhere is extremely expensive (compared to mexican standards) and eating out? Oh my good. We basically starved ourselves, because we simply could't match our budget to eat out in Tulum 3 times a day. That is not on the hotel, but Tulum. It is a horrible place. We felt so sorry for our kids.",40,537

"Ive seen some of the other reviews and not sure how you cant figure out that accommodation was a shipping container. This place had everything I neded for working remotely. I was ON THE BEACH, quiet (this can be a real problem in Tulum) Steps away from the water. Massage on site, Bar/restaurant on site. I loved this place. Only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 rating was the room could use a small refrigerator, and a couple of chairs.",10,537
"Deserve zero stars   The rooms are shipping containers with no windows! The bathroom is outside of your container, outdoors, and looks like a public restroom, it smells awful.   If you don’t like small spaces, you shouldn’t stay here.  If you are a former prison inmate and homesick, this place might be for you",50,537
"On the pictures, they don't show you that you'll be staying in a repurposed shipping container.  Check in was full of drama since they didn't have my reservation (made through TripAdvisor).    The shipping container hotel room is extremely cramped, with an external bathroom that is actually outdoors so you must leave your shipping container to use the toilet or shower.   No toilet paper.    The air conditioning for this small unit is extremely powerful so you either freeze your a$$ off or you swelter with no ventilation.  A mosquito colony must live nearby to pray on people taking a shower or using the toilet.   We booked two nights and were so appalled after seeing the place that we found another accommodation immediately.   100% cancellation applies even for the unused night. ",50,537

"Mara Villa is just exactly where we want to be on the island.  When I picture my vacation it starts out with a cup of coffee, sitting in an adirondack chair on the beach at Mara Villa, waiting for the sunrise.  I was lucky enough to have three trips to MV this year with my favorite being in July/August.  The nesting turtles were amazing this year!!  We just got back from a pretty rainy trip (Nov. 9-16) and having the ability to watch the rolling waves from your covered back porch (or even right from bed) makes a huge difference.  Thanks to Ronda and Bruce for such a lovely, affordable spot on Isla.",50,538
"We have stayed at Maravilla Caribe several times. Sometimes a month or more at a time. It is our favorite laid back gem on Isla, and the place I always recommend to friends headed to the island.  The rates are very reasonable. Especially for apartments that are well equipped with comfortable beds, good showers, and kitchenettes. The location is fantastic - open the glass doors and you have your toes in the sand. Waking up in the morning to the sound of the waves and a beautiful sunrise is what life on Isla is all about. The hosts - Bruce and Ronda go out of their way to make guests feel at home and they really love Isla.",50,538
"Our second visit to Isla Mujeres and we decided to stay mid island.  We had heard wonderful things about Maravilla Caribe and decided to book it!  We absolutely made the right decision! Amazing views of the Caribbean Sea, beach steps from our sliding glass door, beautiful sunrises, turtles nesting late night, iguanas sunning and did I mention the AMAZING VIEWS!   Our hosts were amazing thru our booking process to making sure what to tell the cab driver when we arrived! Many restaurants and Chedraui in walking distance.  Cabs aplenty if you don’t like walking.  Other guests staying there who were all return guests made us feel at home as well! Comfortable bed and very nice showers! Would recommend highly staying at Maravilla Caribe if you are wanting to relax and enjoy your trip!",50,538
This is NOT a 5 star room on the 5th floor.!!!! It is a clean comfortable room with kitchenette on the ground floor. From our sliding door to the beach is about 6 feet..!   The waves are about 50 feet away.. Yes we loved it..!!!,40,538
This hotel was practically empty when we stayed. We saw two other couples once each during our three days. It was clean and comfortable BUT felt like a cave as we were given a room without windows except to the public passageway so blinds needed to be down the whole time so there was no natural air or light. It felt like a dark cave in the daytime and at night the hallways lights came in through the cracks not allowing darkness for sleeping. Why on earth wouldn’t they give us a better room when the hotel was clearly empty. We also asked for a fridge and that was unavailable.,20,539
A great pace to stay if you are in Tulum. The staff were very helpful and knew Tulum very well. Rooftop bar and swimming pool is a nice addiction to the trip. A great place with everything close by. Highly recommended. ,50,539
"We loved our stay at Azul Tulum, and the concierge staff is so kind and helpful - you will feel like they are your friends by the time you leave! Pool is clean and lovely AND non-crowded, showers have great water pressure, pillows are perfect, balcony with a hammock and a good place to hang out your beach towels... There are bicycles you can check out without extra charges for getting to town and the beach, too. If you need a taxi (beware, taxis are expensive in Tulum), the concierge has one there for you typically in about 2 minutes. Our room also had a small kitchenette with mini-refrigerator, coffee pot, toaster oven/broiler, and settings for four people.

"I stayed at Azul Tulum with a friend and our flight came into Cancun at 9:45pm. We were worried we wouldn't be able to get into the hotel as Check-In would be closed before we arrived. But, Azul Tulum contacted us via WhatsApp on the day and gave us details of how to get into the hotel and our room via passcodes on the door. This was so helpful for us. Then we just checked in properly the next morning.   We predominantly had Brenda at the front desk who was super helpful in recommending restaurants, organising bike rental and booking taxis for us. You grab a bike in the morning on a first come first serve basis and this was absolutely no issue for us and we cycled to Playa Paradisio where there were bike racks to chain up. The bikes are fairly basic with no gears but you don't",50,539
" really need those anyway as the journey we took was all pavements and a bit of dirt road.   Taxis are a must in Tulum, it feels very safe in Aldea Zamá to walk around, but further out on the dirt roads and main roads it's easy to feel on edge - especially at night time. As two women, we decided to get taxis in the evenings or if the journey was very long (we got a taxi to Playa Tortugas). However, we live in London and it felt no more dangerous than London. Cities always have bad corners, so just steer clear and stay aware.  Now, onto the hotel itself: our room was very spacious and the king-size bed was amazing! The kitchen was perfect for use and the shower was nice and warm with lots of room inside. No fan or window in the bathroom though, but we just left the door open so the condensation could clear out. No big deal. We had a small terrace area outside with a hammock which was so nice to lie in in the evenings, and we could leave wet clothes out here to dry too. The cleaners come every three days, which is ideal once towels get covered in sand and sun cream! Everyday would definitely be uneccessary. Just put the little card on the door saying 'clean my room' every three days and they'll do it. They even folded our pyjamas at the end of the bed which was very cute. The AC in the room is perfect, as is the fan. Locked safe and walk in wardrobe are a plus.   The foyer area is not huge but it's never very busy around there, the AC is at a good temperature and there's always fresh water available which is great to fill up bottles on the way out.  We didn't spend much time at the rooftop pool but when we did it was so calming and beautiful, there's not a huge amount of space either in the pool or in the seating area but it was never busy when we visited. To note, there is no lift at this hotel. It's all stairs. We were lucky to be on the ground floor so no carrying bags up but maybe request a ground floor room if you need to.  The restaurants around the area are well priced and varying in options. As two vegans we were excited to see so many options for us and would definitely recommend The Pitted Date for breakfast and Safari Comedor for dinner!   Coming here, you'll feel in absolute paradise. Would definitely recommend Azul Tulum to friends.",50,539

We had a terrace to ourselves on the ground floor and it was spacious and great for morning coffee.   The Aldea Zama neighborhood is still under development but it has many great restaurants and amenities in walking distance of Azul including several small markets for basic groceries. There's also a free local cenote in the area that we dropped into a few times, its less than 5 mins walk from Azul. Free bike and scooter rental on site made it easy to get around and get to the beach",50,539
 which is about 20-30 minute bike ride away depending on where you're going. You can reach the Avenida Tulum in about 20-25 minute walk but it's an easy bike ride at 10-15 minutes.

My wonderful boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Isla for my birthday. He visited the area back in March and fell in love.  He picked out the perfect spot for us. The LaHacienda b&b was awesome!

Everything you need is within walking distance with the exception of a good ole ATM make sure you have lots of pesos for your journey around the island  This spot is great for couples or a big group if you wanna rent out the whole place.

It is perfectly located two blocks from the Main Street and the ADO bus station, which makes it quiet, but easy to walk to super cute restaurants or catch a taxi/collectivo to go cenote hoping. The air conditioner is COLD and the WiFi is strong. The hotel is adorably decorated with beautiful plants, bright colors, and unique touches.

We ate pizza and pasta a couple night here and it was delicious and inexpensive.

The staff at BIWA helped us plan out each and every day of our trip and even when plans changed, they did their best to accommodate our wishes. This hotel is great for trips for friends or young couples!

"Dirty, unsafe, rude staff. That sums it up. If I could give this hotel less than one star, I would. I booked a room here for a two-day trip to Isla Mujeres and walked smack dab into one of the most upsetting booking experiences I've ever had.   To start, the guy at the front desk was playing on his cell phone, totally uninterested in checking us in, and then couldn't find a key to our room. We stood on a patio and waited for about twenty minutes while he dug through a desk and finally tried every key on a huge ring to find the one that worked.   From there, we discovered a sickening gob of wet hair (dog? human? I'm not sure), grime, and dirty mop water all over the stairs. In the room, things got even worse. There was a filthy, wet, stinky towel wrapped around the foot of the",10,543
" sink and the bathroom floor was visibly filthy, as you can see in the pictures attached. What's more, there was virtually no furniture in the entire room, and - here's the best part - the door to the back patio DIDN'T LOCK. Not only did it not lock, but it didn't even have a latch to shut completely - even though it was positioned directly over a busy walkway and Mexico is, obviously, a third-world country. I'm assuming that many of you, like myself, are traveling with cash, passports, and computers - so this just won't fly.   We were so freaked out by the entire experience that we immediately booked different accommodations and left. When I contacted the host, Darwyn, about my request for a refund he was rude and inflexible - insisting that it's one of the cheapest rooms in Isla. It sure is - but you can spend $20 more per night, and stay at Hotel Villa Kiin, which is safe, clean, and right on the beach. With my whole heart, I advise that you do that. Avoid this place and its terrible staff AT ALL COSTS.",50,543

"Cold air conditioning, reasonably comfortable beds, the staff are helpful and happy to get you more towels, extra pillows or anything else you need. The shower didnt have strong water pressure but it got the job done. For the price, which is excellent, you get quite a lot. Minifridge in the hotel room is a great perk and there is a swimming pool in the courtyard which is nice and cool. There is also a shared kitchen down there which is great for cooking if you dont want to eat out all the time. The owners were in from LA while I was there and they were wonderful to us. We got to try their ceviche and menudo, some delicious food! Nice people and centrally located, not far from Playa Norte (about a 10 minute walk).",30,543
"Darwyn was the kindest host we could have hoped for. He met us with a smile and such enthusiasm at the start of our stay. The hotel has a great sense of fun about it and the entrance is beautiful. If you are looking for somewhere relaxed, close to the port and with great staff this is your place!",40,543
"My first day there I was joining my friend.The a c was leaking but it got fixed as soon as I told them. 2 days later , no hot water. I was only there for a week. They could use some repairs and maintaining things there. I would pay more for a properly up kept place. ",40,543
"We had a really nice stay at Hotel Paraiso in Isla mujeres.  It is definitely not luxury but there is great value for your money. The room had everything we needed, and house keeping came every day to change the sheets and give us fresh towels.  The room included AC which kept it nice and cool and our unit had a balcony with an ocean view, which was probably my favorite part.  The only con was that the wifi didn't work very well if at all in our room in the far corner of the hotel. However it did work by the lobby and the pool area so we weren't completely without it.  Would definitely stay here again!",40,543
"This is a basic hotel, but very clean and relatively close to all the old town activity.  The people that run this hotel go out of their way to make their guests comfortable.   I arrived as a stranger, a guest of other hotel guests, and felt that I was leaving as a friend.  However, casual visitors should be aware that, during the winter months, regular visitors stay here for extended vacations, and in the evening the courtyard becomes a busy (and boisterous) gathering spot for partying snowbird retirees, many of whom know each other from previous visits.  If you want to make new friends to enjoy Isla Mujeres with, this is the place to be.  Every one was friendly and made me feel very welcome.",50,543
"This is my third stay at Hotel el Paraiso.  It is my favourite place to stay on Isla Mujeres. The midrange price can fit any budget.  The rooms have everything you will need for a comfortable stay.  Beds are comfortable.  Ceiling fan, air conditioning, tv, microwave and fridge.  There is a nice pool and a treed courtyard.  The rooms are big and equipped with safes.  The neighbourhood is great, and you walk to super, the beach, the restaurants in minutes.  The owners and staff are superb and will help with anything.  There is also a community open air kitchen if you feel like cooking!  Many of my friends and family have stayed at this hotel and we have all enjoyed our stays.  I can recommend this place for solo travellers, families, couples.  It is a good for everybody.",40,543
"Stayed here with my daughter, aunt, mother and elderly grandmother. Loved it. Everyone, including the kids were friendly & helpful going out of their way to ensure we were happy & comfortable with every aspect of our stay. My daughter forgot her ipod charger, they found one for her. They put an extra bed in our room. They put extra blankets on grandma's bed to make it more comfortable for her. Loved everything about this hotel except the noisy fridge which next time we will just unplug. So great to have the community kitchen. Convenient location. Spotless. Safe. Can not wait to get back to the island and will be staying here again bringing my younger children with me this time.",40,543
"Docked here for 6 hours and was charged for 24.  Also was charged $5 usd for each person that disembarked....  (onto the dock).  Fuel price was average for the region but the staff were very rude and abrupt.  I would expect a bit more since our fuel bill was North of 2700USD.  Staff told me to speak with MGT, (Federico) to complain..  at any rate, good fuel stop if needed, not much else.  (120ft docks are nice though)",20,544
"Had lunch at the Puerto Isla Mujeres resort and yacht club. I was not disappointed. The food was great, the place was clean. I recommend the place for lunch. I had the fish tacos and I was seated by the pool.",40,544
"Visited our friends at the marina and had  drinks at the pool. They told us the management is very strict  about *everything*. My wife left her sarong by the pool so we took a taxi back to get it. Guards at the gate refused to let us in to get it, nor would they look for it for us, saying we needed to buy a day pass. How absurd. Luckily a nice woman who was staying there went and got it for us.  Also our friends said they couldn't get the wifi to work. They get one extra star because the pool is nice and the food is affordable. And they have a trampoline for kids under 12. ",20,544
"This resort was part of our time share until it got sold to Diamond club. We spent a week or two there for several years. I absolutely loved it, great location away from all the noise from the downtown area. I enjoyed getting up early and walking around the neighborhood, seeing all the locals getting ready for work. The old lady on the corner juicing oranges, the kids going to school. There are some great places to eat right in the area, and the new grocery store is about a 1/4 mile away. Kash Keken is right around the corner, and the little Cuban place nestled in the neighborhood sitting over the lagoon has great food. It is located about 1/2 way down the island so Garrafon park, the turtle refuge, and Pirate Munduca park are close by. Another great place to eat close to the",40,544
" resort is Playa Lancherous, not sure I spelled that right, the amberjack grilled over the fire is delicious. The resort is pretty quiet, and there was usually something that didn't work right, but overall it was a pleasant place to stay. The staff was always helpful and friendly. There used to be a restaurant on the property, but it was closed down the last couple of years we went. It was nice having breakfast under the 100 year old fig tree, as the iguanas came out in the morning.",40,544
…,30,544
"We were off season, so it was exceptionally quiet.  Quieter than I like.  Because  of the low occupancy the service staff was at a minimum, so it wasn't up to par. The resort is quite small and beautiful.  The rooms are amazing.",40,544
"The rooms are very nice, and the staff is very friendly. However when we arrived our room wasn't ready, they then brought us to a room with the wrong beds, and it took us four hours to finally get it right. After a week of reminders, the manager did compensate us with dinner. The front desk staff is all very friendly, but only a few can offer any help regarding where to eat, what to do, or how to make reservations. The pool and rooms are well appointed, very nice facilities. The pool is huge, and has a fountain and a bar in the pool! The rooms are not at all soundproof though, you can hear all the music and talking from the pool, and if you're walking by you can hear conversations from the rooms. While it's technically true that there is Wi-Fi, there's insufficient signal in the",50,544

"Let me start off by saying, I have an Airbnb on my own property in Canada, so I know how things work from both perspectives.  Less than stellar reviews can affect an owner's earnings.  At the same time, I think it's important to be honest, bc other people make decisions based upon the information they read.  Plus side: In a central area on the island, where real people, i.e., not many tourists live.  Local restaurants, stores, a bakery & good sized grocery/liquor store, all within walking distance. The apt., named Luna, is on the 2nd floor, well equiped for longer stays, since it has a great kitchen, with 4 burner propane stove, full size fridge & dishes/ cutlery.  Plenty of fresh water available @ no extra charge. Bathroom is standard 3 piece with shower, water always good &",30,545
" warm.  Bedroom has working AC unit, wifi & tv.  Nice big, comfy chair for sitting, to read, etc.  And upstairs is the common area patio with small above- ground pool.  Lovely spot to get away from the beaches & just totally chill out.  Loved it!    Casa Zuzy is owned by a CDN, named Paul & Lupita, is currently House Manager.  She is a lovely woman, with excellent English language skills, & very helpful with any questions or concerns.  Could Be Better Side: No one was at Casa Zuzy when I arrived.  And yes, I confirmed my arrival time with Paul, well prior to my flight.  Since I had no local access to wifi, I couldn't call the tel. # for Lupita, that Paul had provided.  And he wasn't on the island.  So I waited with my luggage for about 30 min.  Eventually, I thought I need to do something, so I took my suitcase up to the 2nd level, left it therem hoping it was safe, & walked around till I found a woman who had a taco stand & asked her if I could connect to her wifi, to get Lupita's #.  She was very nice & called Lupita for me, & I was told Lupita was at her home but would come to Casa Zuzy to let me in.  And she would call me back once she got there.  Waited another 30 min., with no call back, so called, again & was told I could now come back to Casa Zuzy. When I met Lupita, she said there was a miscommunication, & Paul had told her I would be arriving 2 hrs. later. But, I believe the real problem may have been that the suite was unprepared for my arrival, since Lupita was cleaning when I arrived.  She said she doesn't normally clean herself, but Carnivale had been on, a couple of days before I came, & the person who cleans had missed some things.  This kind of fit, bc I found the bathroom can toilet paper disposal, still had someone else's garbage in it when I went to use it.  Not normally a big deal, but since the island's waste management system can't handle any toilet paper, you must wipe & dispose in the containers.  Good to know beforehand.  Also, it can be very noisy at nite, which Paul did mention.  But it is a bit hit & miss.  Some nites it was pretty quiet, others very noisy as there's a restaurant across the street where they enjoy singing & karioke till around 2 am.  Also, there was construction work going on in the Casa next door, so lots of hammering early (7:30 am).  Ear plugs, may be needed. I think Paul could have done better with the bedding.  Th pics u see of the striped bedcover in 2014 are still the same used now.  They're pretty old, faded & flimsy.  Same with the sheets. Obviously this is a small thing, but if this was in Canada he wouldn't be able to get away with this as people are much pickier.   Also, a bath mat, no slip shower mat, & a couple more bath towels would be a nice touch.  There were 2 large ones for the week, but I had to use 1 for the floor.  Would I return to Casa Zuzy,  maybe.....",50,545

"My daughter & I stayed here for a week in February 2020. There are not enough words of praise for Casa Zuzy. , We stayed I. The family apartment on the main floor. We had everything you could hope for & the some. There are two other suites above where we stayed. (I didn’t get to see them). The roof is like an Oasis. With many comfortable lounge chairs and a small pool it was wonderful. The manager “Lupita” was absolutely amazing. Very pleasant. She gave us a welcoming walk through & was extremely accommodating !  We would highly recommend staying here. We definitely plan to go back!",50,545
"If you are looking for quite accommodation while visiting Isla Mujeres and a local neighborhood do not stay in Casa Zuzy as the location of property is extremely noisy. You can find other accommodation in this town south of the north end, that is very quiet. The noise consists of gas golf karts, scooters, motor bikes, delivery trucks, and barking dogs 24/7 passing this property that is located on a busy corner in the town.",50,545
"I came to Casa Zuzy and Isla Mujeres over the Christmas break. It was very easy to get to as I was picked up by taxi and taken to Casa Zuzy (houses are named and most taxi drivers know where it is) for a very cheap fee (50 pesos). The house was in a great location and looks great. I love the location because everything is a short walk. It is about a 3 minute walk and you are at the Ocean. I really loved this spot because there are some great restaurants around and some great walking. The apartment itself on the second floor was great. It had air conditioning for the night and lots of sunshine, a kitchenette and stocked with books and everything I would ever need. Lastly, the upstairs patio is amazing. Great views of the island and pure sunshine. If you are coming to the island",50,545

"We had all three units for a week with our extended family. It was such a great place to use as a home base. There is lots to do on the island, much more than I expected. We were very close to the beach, great restaurants, and the downtown tourist area.  We saw Mayan ruins, a sea turtle farm, and lots of local Mexican life. It was great to see the kids playing at night and get a glimpse into the local culture. There is always a lovely breeze on the roof patio. We decided to rent a golf cart to get around for the week. It was lots of fun, but you can easily walk or catch a taxi. The units are so reasonably priced. It was a wonderful week. Gracias!",40,545
"We stayed at Casa Zuzy in La Luna for 1 week and really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is a good size, plenty of space and a large balcony. The rooftop is a great place to chill out and watch the sun go down.  We loved being amongst the local neighbourhood; hearing kids playing in the street, people heading off to work & the local businesses getting around. The sounds of the neighbourhood were lovely (and some of the music was very catchy!) There are plenty of shops and supermarkets nearby, as well as lots of places to eat. And MUCH cheaper than in the Centro district. We generally walked into town, however taxis are reasonably priced.

It is in the middle of the tourist centre but the rooms surrounding a courtyard are quite and it doesn't feel like your in the crowded town. There are bikes and stuff for the beach which you can use for free. We only saw the owner twice but that was fine with us.

The condo itself is tucked away enough that you feel set back from the noise of the North Beach... but close enough to everything. Around the corner we ate at the Mango Cafe. Had a special night at Pizza Mike's and could easily get a taxi any time of day. Property was managed extremely well... and so much charm! We made friends with local kitty and local pup.

King size bed was huge and fit all three of us for our entire stay with room to spare.  The pull out couch is the kind that folds out to the floor....daughter wasn't too crazy about sleeping on that but it was fine.  The shower had the best water pressure that I have ever experienced on the island.  AC worked great but just a fyi.......push the mode button if it ever turns off by itself.  Great balcony with two hammocks.  The small pool in the back was great to come back to after a day at the beach....the only thing I would recommend would be for the pool guy to come regularly to check the chlorine.,50,547
  It got pretty yucky after a couple of days.  There is a very friendly cat that will try to get into the apartment so make sure the screen is closed.  On our the last two days of our stay the neighbors started construction so the banging started at 8am on Saturday but nothing on Sunday and it was raining on Monday when we left. It really didn't bother us because we weren't there during the day but might want to check to make sure it is done if you intend to hang out at the apartment.  WIFI was great!!!,50,547

The a/c worked extremely well and our room had great Wifi. I would return to hotel Maria del pilar in the future, you get a lot for your money.  There is a little cafe on the closest corner that serves a great breakfast too.",40,549
"Brilliant sculpture of architecture and my favorite place to visit! Private pool and courtyard with your own iguanas, open floor plan and king sized beds render this spot luxurious and comfortable. I've been home less than one week and already am planning my next trip back. My birthday getaway with besties was ideal here during the pandemic. Vane stocks the fridge, arranges for the golf cart rental and doctor to come and give the covid test required to travel. Minutes away from the big grocery store, live music and snorkel spots!

"When this came up on our search of what to do on the island, we figured we had to drive by, right?  It was pouring rain but we found it easily and stopped from the opposite side of the street to get a look.  It's a very unique house for sure.",40,550
"If you are looking for a place where everything fits perfectly, and has all the comforts of a 5 star hotel, this place is not for you. But if you are looking for a quiet getaway, in a 3rd world country environment, this place is fantastic! The woman that runs it takes care of your every need. We stayed there with my handicapped brother (can't use his left side) and his wife and had a terrific time! She picked us up at the ferry, had our meals delivered, showed us where to get a golf cart,....I could go on and on. My highest recommendation.",50,550
"I just drove by to look at this house - worth doing if you have a golf cart for the day! Can't see too much while still being respectful of the people staying there, but it is easy to pull over across the street.",40,550
"Completely adorable accommodations with all inside accents shells as well! 2 master suites with king beds, not child friendly due to second level open balcony and work being done in the back yard. The pool was perfect and the tourists love to drive by and stop for photos, so privacy is not 100%. Kitchen needs work but is fully usable. The lovely Vanessa lives next door and will assist  and make arrangements for most anything you need. Near the south end, all restaurants and beaches are a short golf cart or taxi ride away. Easy walk to Ixchel temple ruins.",40,550
I actually rented the upstairs apartment that is owned by the same family that owns the Shell House! Let me say first they are so dang wonderful there is no reason not to stay in either location! I did find the apartment on AirBnB but it is not listed here. Just know that these ladies will go out of there way to make sure you are accommodated. I will be staying at the Shell House on my next visit. It is way more beautiful in person! You will not be disappointed.,50,550
Had read about the shell house on TripAdvisor. We came across it during our travels. Very interesting architecture! Very cool in person! Apparently it's a rental home if you want to see what it's like to live in a seashell. ,50,550
"If you want to stay in an art piece, then this is the place to stay.  The architecture and artwork are stunning.  The owner's are the BEST!!!! We will DEFINITELY be going back!  It's not a hotel, but an actual house!  You don't have to worry about crowds, you have total privacy.  You have your own pool!  The owner takes you on a personal tour of the property and she gave us a bottle of wine, bottled cokes, bottled water and cookies as a welcome gift.  Simply WONDERFUL",50,550
"This is one of the most beautiful and unusual homes I have ever stayed in.  What a treat. We had seen it online and had visited the island before and drove past and joked, ""wouldn't it be great if they rented this place?"" and now... they do!  The logistic details: The caretakers are literally next door, but there is a wall, so you feel very private in your own oasis. We swam at night and loved it! We played our music outside. It really is your own space, but... if you need anything, they are right next door. The maid comes once during your stay and they will schedule it with you. And what service! We arrived so late! Fun fact: you can obtain a same day emergency passport in many cities. A fact I wish I did not know. Our passport problems put us coming in very late, like midnight",50,550
" late. They arranged for a taxi to met us at the ferry terminal (we did not pay for the taxi. They did). Then they were there waiting for us even though it was so very late. They had keys in hand, gave us a  tour, wifi password, ran back to get us coffee, creamer, sugar, fresh fruits for the morning. Just splendid people and amazing service! Beer and some sodas were in the fridge when we arrived as well. Water is from a very large dispenser on the kitchen and a refill water is there as well! golf cart parking is right out the front gate. See photo.   Photo opportunities: everywhere we looked there was something to photograph. My daughter even did her impression of Botticelli's Venus in the small shell bedroom. (See photos). Certainly the outside of the building is exquisite and unusual, but look at the beautiful hand carved doors that look like they led to Narnia was some magical land. (See photos). Even the interior stairway is a work of art. Marble perhaps? it's just lovely.   The bedrooms: the beds! so comfortable. Really. I slept like a baby. I felt like the mattresses were almost new. Just a delicious night's sleep, every night. The birds will wake you up early if you are in the big shell, but it's not unpleasant, and not a ton of bird noise. Bring earplugs if oversensitive. I hopped out of bed every morning anyway (and I'm not a morning person) to have the pool all to myself before the kids woke up. dreamy!!  bathrooms: wonderful decor. Nice shell hooks for towels and other items. plenty of shelf space.   So how large is the kitchen really? I've seen past guests say it was too small. We found it to be a boutique kitchen, certainly the fridge was large and perfect but the sink and stove are on the small size. There is not a large oven, so don't come here to plan on cooking a 10 course meal for 12 people, but it is totally suitable for a one or two week stay, making eggs for breakfast, and cooking other items. plenty of glassware, barware, dishes. I thought it was sized just right for being on vacation and having most dinners out. The grocery store is close and we kept the fridge stocked with juices, beer, Remember there is also a grill outside, so buy some fresh fish and cook!  security: We stayed in the big shell and our kids stayed in the little shell. Their shell locked. our shell locked. We had a safe for valuable that locked. The owners are right next door. It is a peaceful sweet area of the island. I NEVER felt unsafe.  flora and fauna: I know they note this on their site, but we fell in love with a little geckos and iguanas hanging out by the pool. We named the large one Iggy Pop, one was Freddie Mercury, and one was Pink Floyd. Rather than being a detraction, they were a real highlight for my 11 and 13-year-olds. The iguanas would hang out on the outskirts of the pool area, just close enough to be fascinating and remind us that ""we are not in North Carolina anymore"".  We had one small gecko in the bedroom a couple of nights, and my children, who were sleeping in the smaller Shell, would deeply jealous of our gecko. They are part of the Isla landscape, and they really lovely addition.  Living areas and common areas: Everything was well-kept up, and looking at past photos versus the photos we have, it seems like that are new custom made cushions for the living area. They are blue and white color scheme and are really nice. The couch was huge and we joked that we needed to make some local friends so we could seat everyone! Aircon in bedrooms and in main house was very good.    Advice/regrets.  We did not take advantage of the grill. I had mapped out all the restaurants I wanted to try for dinner and it filled all of our days, and that is a regret.I would have loved to try to grill! The caretakers were so awesome. We had booked some excursions on our own, and later found out that they had contacts everywhere and could have handled everything. Regret not leaning on them more. They are awesome!  Go to the local big grocery and buy your tequila, wine, snacks etc. Plenty of room in the freezer for ice cream. Everything is so inexpensive compared to the states!  Also, we brought some fun photo 'props"", such as long blue fabric to drape on my daughter to look like a mermaid. We wanted to bring a trident for my son. ;) We took some photos shoots outside the shell and they look amazing!",50,550

"I stayed 2 nights with my boyfriend to this hotel. The room is small and we both found the bed very uncomfortable, however the price and the location were awesome. You can walk easily to the beach (10 minutes) or on the main avenues to grab something to eat. The room is old and dated, but the wifi and a/c worked perfectly. For the price it was perfect.",40,551

Regardless of what you need, Lucy and Juan will do anything they can to accommodate you.

It may be a simple abode, but it more than makes up for it with the countless ways that this family hotel will ensure that you're happy. Just like the island compels people to return year after year, you can expect to see the same guests, in the same rooms, with their little creature comforts that makes the hotel feel like home.

"Hotel Carmelina is centrally located on a side-street on the north end of Isla Mujeres. Nearby conveniences include a good Padi-certified dive shop, supermarket (to buy cold bottled water) & laundromat. The ferry wharf is about 150m away, and north beach about 200m. We had a small double-bed room for 3 nights with air conditioning, ceiling fan & separate bathroom. In low season this was a mere 400 pesos per night. Wi-Fi is free but have to sit next to reception, but that is no trouble as it is outside in the warm air. The room was comfortable & functional, though small. It did include a small bar fridge.  Staff friendly, check-out time was 12 noon. We left our bags there after check-out to take a last dip into the sea before catching the UltraMar (ferry) back to mainland.",40,551

We are glad the Hotel Carmelina was one of the places we checked out. It had AC, Refrig, Small flat screen TV, and WiFi. All for 500 Peso's. The Bed was hard for me, but my Wife likes hard Beds. The room shown in the picture is room #1, the room we stayed in for two nights. Yes paint is needed, but the room was clean and up to our basic needs. We would stay again if we could stay in room #1, Or one like it.",40,551

Unfortunately,  I did not purchase the insurance.   I contacted to owner/manager, who was completely unhelpful and outright rude, ""hope you got travel insurance "" was his response. I am out my entire reservation fee,  over $1200. I even asked if we could reschedule our trip.  He was unresponsive.    Now that I've canceled,  he can rent the property and receive double booking fees, because my fees are unrefundable.  Seems like a crook.",10,552

The property is beautifully maintained by the caretakers who live on site and are always ready to lend a hand with your luggage and whatever else you may need.  They'll even pick up your groceries for a minimal fee.  The pool is great, the beach is great, the places to rest and relax throughout the property are amazing.  We can't think of anywhere we'd rather stay.",50,552
"We absolutely loved our stay in Cottage Sam at Villas Makax. Steve and Lindell were perfect hosts, the property is beautifully maintained and perfect if peace and relaxation is part of your vacation. The pool is great, 86f all day long, there’s palapas, sun louggers and the beach is very clean. By golf cart you can get just about everywhere in 15-20 mins. To the south….. Punta Sur, obviously, plenty of beach clubs, bars….The Joint, Ice Bar, etc etc, Playa Lancheros had wonderful Tikin Xic, the snorkeling down near Garrofon was great…..we went to Kin Ha beach club just north of the Garrafon park.  Under the pier there are tons of colorful fish. Back to Villas Makax though, we can’t recommend it highly enough. Rooms were very clean, beds were comfy, plenty of amenities, wonderful",50,552

I’d say Makax could be a great extended family venue…. Rent all the cottages and enjoy the island. We’re certainly going back!!!!! Obviously the busy nightlife up in the north of the island isn’t right outside your door, but for us that was ok. We still went to town most nights for dinner…. Fish’n’gin, Jax, La Kantina, DeNuccios, Las Mariscos,  it’s hard to find a bad place. Being British my Champions league football was important and Jax was the place for that.

"If you decide to save a few hundred bucks by renting this “gatehouse” instead of one of the other three casitas, be aware that you will be abutting the wall that faces a very busy and noisy road from 7am to 10pm. One of your two windows will be facing a parking area with a fair amount of comings and goings as well as a tool shed that is in use for repairs around the property. The other three casitas are beyond a low wall past a bit of better kept garden around a pool and with a view of the ocean. Don’t know about the other casitas but ours was not properly cleaned prior to our arrival including a filthy toilet seat, dust in places and dishes that needed washing.

"Absolutely incredible, photos don’t do it justice. My boyfriend and I wanted a little slice of heaven that wasn’t a resort lined with beach chairs every 10 feet, and this was it. The privacy was incredible, the grounds were immaculate, and between the on site caretaker, Juan, and the owners Steve & Lindell, you couldn’t have asked for a friendlier, more helpful crew. Our palapa was in wonderful condition and we had zero complaints about cleanliness, comfort etc. The screens on the doors and windows allow for a wonderful breeze during the day, and the ac for the evening cools you off after you’ve been sunburned enjoying the private pool. 100% will be coming back and will only settle for Villa Makax! Bring a book, let Netflix wait until you get home and just enjoy yourself!",50,552

There is also a friendly couple who are caretakers.   And of course Lassie is a lovable pet who loves treat when she greets you.

This is my second time on the island and expect to return.   Pros- Staff was nice and helpful, Location (close everything), free lockers ( I fit 2 cameras and a few other things in there), meeting people, price (cheapest last minute option I saw), basic breakfast.

First of all, cleanliness. The place is very clean and tidy throughtout.  Wifi service: free and good. I had no problem to upload a lot of pictures on social media, and surf on internet. Free simple map of Tulum. It's good to have it. You can rent a bike. All bikes in a good working order. I got a red one almost brand new with comfortable saddle.

I stayed at this hostel twice and the second time I stayed for a month. Really enjoyed my stay. It's a simple hostel but it's super clean. The manager and their family make you feel like home. They have good coffee in the morning. Most of the time it's very quiet so it's a good place to chill. You can cycle to the beach in 15 mins or walk to the main street in 8 mins. Highly recommended!,50,554
"The staff here were so friendly. We arrived early but our room was ready and they let us check in well in advanced of the check in time. They even offered us breakfast as it was still open. Later that evening the manager was back and upgraded us to a private room with en suite (from a 4 bed dorm) which was a lovely gesture.   The hostel itself is open air, a breeze throughout, hammocks, games, books and just very chilled out. It’s a short 3 minute walk from the Main Street past street food vendors.   We’d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place in Tulum. ",50,554

"Such a wonderful stay and overall experience. Perfect stay to be in downtown Tulum and a bang for your buck.   Our hotel manager was very responsive and attentive of all of our needs. Unfortunately, our private pool got dirty from the rain, but she quickly cleaned it and was ready in a few hours. Even simple as needing more pillows.   Our room was super clean and loved how their cleaning staff would come everyday to clean the floors and re-make the bed. Since the floors would get dirty from our shoes and such. Oh and they would set new towels for us as well.   Truly grateful for the free parking. And there’s usually available parking. However… PLEASE KEEP IN MIND about the roads. They are really super bad and terrible to drive in with deep potholes but we managed. Just drive",50,555
" super slow and careful especially during the rain. I wouldn’t recommend to drive late at night since it may be a little too hard to see.   Check in was super easy and quick. The front desk will check for your reservation and then will connect you to speak with their manager or whoever your rental manager is. Our manager gave us tips and offered to help schedule restaurant reservations or beach reservations in the popular Tulum area which is by the beach.   The Location was only about 5-10 minutes from the main downtown Tulum area. I would say 10 minutes because we would drive very slow due to the roads. There is also a taco stand down the street which is only about a 5 minute walk.   Lastly, the amenities… the pool was seriously breathtaking. Haven’t seen a circular shaped pool like that with such an astonishing view. We saw there was a small gym but we didn’t have the time to use it but at least it’s an option.   We would highly recommend this beautiful stay and we would definitely come stay again. I would highly recommend to stay in downtown Tulum than the main Tulum road by the beach.

They obviously have not communication between stuff members and no receptionist after 7pm. This created difficulty as I need my passport urgently the next day.",40,556
"Checked in for a 7 day yoga package. Great value; two yoga sessions each day (including one guy who is the best teacher I’ve ever had), outstanding breakfast, lovely massage, dinner (credit vouchers to use at two local restaurants - both great), beach towels and bikes. Glampped one night - Lovely tent and super comfortable bed. From then had a room in main house; absolutely huge and very nice. All immaculately clean.  So many pros to staying here - can’t list them all! The yoga and food are grest. Bikes look (and handle) like they’re from 1800 but - hey - it worked!",50,556
"It was my first time sleeping in a tent,it was a really great experience. Some humidity inside the tent with some ants but not a big problem. Sharing bathrooms and showers were great I never saw people there and it was always clean.  Staff were so quite and very nice.",50,556
"The hotel is regular. Simple breakfast, unprivileged location. The room is very spacious but very humid. Everything seemed to smell bad all the time, and it even looks like the sheets were wet. If I was looking for a place to rest, I wouldn't choose this hotel again.",30,557
"The place is confy with a central pool and hammocks, our room (superior one) was large and nicely decorated  with really confortable beds and a clean and practical kitchen. There was also a free water dispenser, wich avoids buying tons of plastic bottles at the (very close) supermarket. In the end we had booked 2 nights and added a third one to relax before heading to playa del Carmen.",50,557
"My partner and I have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay! Staff are very polite and helpful, able to give advice on tours, tickets and the area. We bought tickets for the Casa Tortuga Cenotes which was great, would definitely recommend. We enjoyed the pool area, it’s very tranquil. Rooms are nice, only downfall being our balcony faced on to the road which is extremely loud at night time which made it difficult to sleep. Yummy breakfast! Location is good, hotel is located just off of the Main Street - Avienda Tulum which has lots of bars and restaurants. Long walk to the beach! We got a taxi.",40,557
"Good location, 5mins walk from the Main Street of Tulum Nice room, enough space. Clean. Breakfast ok, few choices.  Early noises from the car wash next to the hotel, the only thing I could say that it was disappointing about this hotel.",40,557
"The hotel is not located well.  The staff are great.  The manager is super nice and sensible.  The room we stayed in was on the ground floor and smelt musty when we got there.  Upstairs rooms are better generally.  Good breakfast.  We paid too much though.  the single bed was very uncomfortable, needs a thicker mattress.",40,557
"Great spot, super cozy suites with the authentic mexican vibe! Functional rooms, great shower, super clean and quiet at night. The lady at the front desk was very welcoming! Strongly recommend the superior suites! ",50,557
"Firstly, the hotel is not near the centre of Tulum as advertised. It is in a dodgy area on the very outskirts of town next to a strip club.  We walked 2km from the centre of town to find the place, only the find the receptionist said we did not have a booking. Because the place looked terrible and nothing like the Booking.com listing we decided to leave it anyway.  Later the same day my credit card has been charged $3600 pesos which is more than the original stay was even supposed to cost and they won’t refund me.  These guys are crooks. Don’t stay here. ",10,557
"My sister and I stayed here for 5 nights while on holiday. Initially we had not booked for 3 because we weren’t sure if we were going to stay in Tulum the whole time; they were very accommodating when we decided to stay longer and matched the online price without prompting. We found the staff friendly, location great (close to town but about 5km from beach; we hired bikes and there was a nice footpath the whole way!). The included breakfast was simple but totally fine and unlike the other reviews we had no issues with hot water (and stayed in 3 different rooms). Would stay again!! ",50,557
"As we were travelling during high season, the hotel prices were really high and so Uolis Nah was one of the few that fit our budget but seemed still a decent hotel. It has a cozy inner yard, nice breakfast and although it was expensive, compared to other hotels in Tulum, still had relatively OK value for the price.   The worst thing with this accommodation was a neighbour-rooster who was screaming all night! Luckily we had ear plugs, but still.. We nicknamed the place ""Petuh-nah"", with ""petuh"" meaning ""rooster"" in Russian.   Moreover, some little annoying things: there was basically no hot water, the breakfast didn't start at 8 as was promised, the attitude of the staff was random, the bicycles were really-really old and unridable. Considering all this, if I went again to Tulum",30,557
" and still had the same budget, I would maybe choose something closer to the city centre.",10,557
The resort now has a new name it’s called the Gramercy Hotel. It’s a small boutique hotel at the southern portion of the hotel zone on Tulum beach. Check in was easy and efficient but we did experience a slight delay in room being ready. We sat at there bar and had some drinks and 30 min later room was ready. The staff was very friendly and addressed some small concerns we had (safe batteries were low). Our room was an ocean facing room and it had a spectacular view. It was clean and bed was very comfortable. Temperatures during the day were in the high 80s and during the night it was in the 60s so we did not need to use the AC. Breakfast was included and it was wonderful. I recommend the avocado toast. Areas that could use improvement are very little storage in rooms for cloths,40,558

" and suitcases, and better service on the beach chairs it was hard to get a waiter to bring us drinks or provided service and at times felt I was an inconvenience.  This is the only reason this is a 4 rating than a 5. In the evenings you can take a cab down the road to some amazing night life and restaurants or walk. The walk was about 15 min. It was very safe. They also have bikes to rent it was about 40 min bike ride to the ruins. And across the street is a lagoon that rents kayaks for 250 pessos for the day. Overall it was a good experience and with some small improvements could be a top destination in Tulum. ",50,558

The gym at the resort is very good and the spa (reviewed separately) was excellent.   The resort is a bit secluded but the walk to night life is only ten to fifteen minutes and there are plenty of taxis. ,30,558

Pictures show and describe lush trees and jungle surrounding the building which may have been years ago but this is no longer the case. The area is developing, lots of construction. The listing also stated there is free shuttle service to their sister site beach club, the shuttle is not free - it is 500 pesos per person round trip therefore we didn’t use this service.

This year we jumped at the opportunity to stay in one of their new plunge pool rooms and it did not disappoint! The only reason I didn't rate the stay as excellent was because of the ongoing construction. This did not take away from our overall experience except that we did miss the boutique which was under renovation. The plunge pool room was awesome and I'd really like to stay in the others as well. My only critique would be to add an an exterior luggage lift or dumbwaiter to get bags up to the 3rd level rooms. Navigating the beautifully crafted stairs is difficult with suitcases. Other than that, my wife & I can't wait to get back!",40,559

When we came back from the restaurant the man who manages the parking claimed us 150 pesos or... a soda! A soda! If we gave it the money he probably kept it for him not for the hotel he works for. If we don’t give him something he’ll send our numberplate to the police.   Hopefully the restaurant’s manager we went to gave him a soda and the parking’s manager was very happy.

" list is too long.  We asked the first days to reserve bike for the day after - the lady said “first come first served”.  The next morning we ask for bikes - they were all gone and the other front desk clerk said :”you should have reserved yesterday !” What ?!? Anyway we rented bikes that day and reserved the hotel one for the day after. The morning after, they had the bikes for us… but what happen to them in 2 years ?!? First time we came they were going well, now, every part are shaking, there is rust everywhere (so much you cannot adjust the bench anymore it is stuck there), the mechanism is ruff and the break are slack (see picture!) - we didn’t used them and rented bikes again !  To finish it all, the first morning, I made myself a coffee with the nespresso coffee machine there - which was working fine (I also have a Nespresso machine home since at least 7 years).  When I came back, they told me : your Nespresso Machine is broken  I asked :”What happen, it was working fine this morning”… They said “yours to tell us!” I didn’t broke it, and if I would have, I would have told them ! They wanted me to pay for the replacement of it - I felt they really tried to do extortion on me ! Could this broken machine come from an other room ? Could it be the made ? Howcome they k ew before me that it was broken ? I don’t know, the only thing I know it’s I didn’t break it (they are quite solid in top of that) and they try to trick me. After a harsh discussion, they finally accept to gave me my deposit back (minus the room charge, on which there was of course overcharges…), but for the first time in my life I don’t trust an hotel and I’ll make sur the amount is refunded in my bank account…  On the good side : the breakfast and the lady serving it was nice, and the interior court is still cute.  All this to say : Tulum is a little paradise full of great, design, affordable and fun hotel, don’t bother to come here anymore - they dont bother to maintain the place well or to give you a nice experience anyway…",50,560

"Shambala is full of love. Everyone who works there is kind and approachable and very helpful. The healthy food is delicious and full of color. The location is special. The cabanas are unique and you really live on the beach, with all the weather and sea creatures! Watercraft is available, a cool infinity pool,  and everyone walking by on the beach stops to take in the magic of this place.  Tulum has changed a lot since I was there 20 years ago. Upon leaving Shambala, it’s bougie out there and clubs and luxury abound. Yes, you can hear the clubs, feel the base at night. I preferred to stay within the loving vibes of Shambala and take it all in. I’d love to return again, especially with #soulfullwellnesscolorado",50,561
"Incredible service and hospitality!!  Spectacular grounds!!!  Wow, wow wow is all I can say!!!  This beautiful resort is right on the beach and as far as I know has the only beach front pool in Tulum This incredible hotel is set right in the heart of Action! The owner Roberto and the staff were incredibly welcoming, warm, kind and helpful and attended to my every need and desire! What I love about this place is that you get a true authentic beach hut vibe with a modern internal design and a beautiful garden too. It’s is paradise and I can’t wait to go back there!!!!",50,561
"You will never get a better experience than you will find during your stay at Shambala Petit. There are so many thoughtful touches around this resort that show just how much they care about making your experience effortless.   This place offers tranquility and privacy while still providing exclusive access to the best beach spot on Tulum beach.   The owner Roberto is the nicest man you will ever work with and has lived here for over 20 years so he knows all of the best spots to eat, drink, shop, and party.   The staff is all very friendly and accommodating.   The best part is the breakfast every morning where everyone comes and shares a meal while getting to know one another.   You will not be disappointed when you choose to stay at Shambala Petit.",50,561
We rented all the rooms at Shambala for our wedding party in Tulum. It made our wedding experience amazing! The location is perfect in the beach zone. The rooms are authentic but really pretty. The grounds and the pool are what make the hotel a perfect spot. It's the only hotel with a beachfront pool. Roberto and his team helped organize food and drinks throughout the weekend so it felt like a mini resort. We loved our stay!,50,561
"Booked 6 nights at Shambala expecting this to be a ""rustic"" experience. Arrived and got my room, ok more of a hut. Air conditioning was marginal due to the large 2"" gaps around the doors and other misc. air leaks. Was ok with that. Went into the bathroom, no hot water. It was hot & humid, so I was ok with that. Can't drink the water here and no bottled water provided. Was not ok with this and had to go down the beach to a restaurant to purchase one. Was extremely tired from traveling all day so went to sleep at 8:30pm. Little did I know there was a ""beach club"" next door. Music started at 9:30 and went all night. Ear splitting volume and massive bass. Painfully loud-and I'm a guitar player who was in many rock bands in the 80's & 90's! Needless to say, I left the next morning.",10,561
" Still fighting to get the other 5 nights $ back and to top it off, I got double billed, once by the hotel and once by Booking.com. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!",40,561

"I was here recently for a yoga retreat.  This is not an American style hotel.  Essentially the rooms are huts by the ocean and some are partially open to the elements.  There is air conditioning but it runs only from 6 pm tp 6 am.  Hot water is spotty at best.  Expect to share your space with lizards, insects and the occasional iguana.  You will be given two only bottles of water, but there are free refills in the public areas of the hotel.  The rooms have sliding doors with padlocks and you will carry your key with you on your wrist. If you don’t like nature this is not the place for you.  You will be going barefoot on the premises and there are bird baths in front of each room to rinse your feet. Sheets and towels are changed every three days.  You cannot use a hair dryer as",40,561
"The 2 bedroomed apartment is huge and very clean. There are 2 sofas and a huge 6 person dining table and chairs in the vast air conditioned lounge. All of these are easily accommodated in this vast room. The tv worked fine and you can use your usb on it. There is also free wifi.  The bedrooms were air conditioned and are a really good size, the beds and pillows were very comfy.  Both bedrooms come with their own en suite bathrooms and showers.  The hot water showers are excellent and have 24hr hot water and great water pressure. There is also a hand basin with extra toiletries and a chest of drawers for any storage you might need.  The bedrooms come with a fitted wall unit with plenty of space for suitcases and clothes etc. The wall unit comes with another chest of drawers for",50,562
" any other clothes or items you might have. There is extra towels, bedding and a safe for you. Storage is definitely not a problem in these rooms.  The kitchen has all the equipment if you want to do self catering. It has a gas cooker, fridge, microwave, plates, bowls, cutlery, cups and a coffee machine with free coffee pods and tea bags supplied daily, although they could be doing with getting a kettle. It also has two sinks to put your plates etc in.  The room is meticulously cleaned every day. They supply fresh towels, bedding, soaps, shampoo, toilet rolls, lotions, and clean any kitchen stuff left on a daily basis.  My son and his girlfriend had the smaller 1 bedroomed apartment, with no kitchen. It was a very good size and had air con, wifi, tv, fridge, coffee machine etc. Also, it had an extra sofa bed if needed.  The location of the hotel is about 200 metres from the main strip in Tulum and it has a local Oxxo (7-11 type shop) right across the road from it.  The rooftop has two nice small dip pools and is the only place in the hotel where people can smoke.  Some staff spoke limited English but still managed to communicate, all were helpful and very friendly. They can also organise any taxis or trips you might want to take.  It is a little expensive, i think we paid £170 - £200 per night for the 2 bedroomed aparment, and around £140-150 for the 1 large double bed room, but it was worth it in our eyes. Excellent place and i highly recommended it.",50,562

"This is hands down my favorite place to stay in Mexico (I’ve visited this region 20+ times). Although the description is “a room” it’s basically an apartment with a kitchen, dining table, and a sitting area. While the property is spacious, clean, safe, and huge the real gem is the staff! Sabine is an angel and her recommendations from dining options to excursions were always top tier! I really debated about reviewing this property because I love it so much and want to keep it as my private sanctuary but I love them all so much I want to see them succeed. This place is rare and a hidden gem!",50,562
"We loved everything about the Azura Boutique. Right from booking Sabine was amazing, she was so helpful: she organised our bike hire and gave us loads of great advice on where to eat/things to do etc. The apartment is really spacious and very clean. It looked exactly like the pictures, except bigger. We loved that they provided a drinking water dispenser, it saved us buying bottled water all the time. The apartment is in the town, really close to great restaurants and bars and it’s such a lovely cycle to the beach. We particularly enjoyed the roof top area for sunbathing and watching the sunset. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Tulum. ",50,562
"We stayed in the Azura for 4 nights in Jan 21 and we can 100% recommend the place. Sabine does a outstanding job, from the welcome, to the customer managements until the check out. She is carrying about her clients like a mother :)  the location is perfect to get around Tulum citiy. There are many good local restaurants in foot distance. the room are very clean and pretty. the roof top with various small pools are perfect to escape from very busy Tulum.  Access to the beach is very easy by bike. Sabine will help you to organize the bicycles. again, it is all about simplicity. You will enjoy your stay like a queen and king  PS: We stays in 5 star all-inclusive hotels prior the stay and in small luxury hotels after. So we have a good comparability of top hotels around.   Sabine,",50,562
" again a special thank you to you and the team. we will recommend your place to whoever we know and intends to go to Tulum. The rating is speaking for itself.  Cheers, Klara and Chris (Switzerland)",40,562

"Lovely boutique hotel with an amazing rooftop patio and plunge pools. We only spent one night here and wish we could have stayed longer. Fantastic sunset views from the rooftop patio, very safe area and close walk to the high street with a useful shop opposite.  The rooms were spotless and the included breakfast was lovely. Will be the only place we look at if we ever return.",40,562
"The reviews about this place are completely right. This is such a great place to stay in Tulum.   It is so clean, professional, friendly, and feels a really calming space. The apartment has everything you might need and more. Especially loved the gorgeous smelling toiletries, bath robes, welcome drinks and snacks, fully equipped kitchen so we could cook for the first time in months on our travels, Netflix and WiFi that worked, unlimited drinking water, air con machines in the bedroom and kitchen/seating area, and a gorgeous breakfast delivered to your door each morning.   Loved it .... you should stay here. ",40,562
"We were told it has laundry. But there was no laundry. The beach is really nice and very quiet. Seaweed isn't even horrible like some other parts in the area. 1 little cove to snorkel but there is a tour boat with 10 people visiting every hour. I was told this resort is set for demolition in 2 years and it shows. Its fairly run down. Pool was more like a slough. No way I was getting into it.  The bbq on site is a pile of rust and lizards.  The sand is really nice and clean, the staff are friendly and bar service is excellent.  The cenote is a nice quiet swim. Food service stops at 5 pm sharp. And they provide zero options after that. All in all I only give it a 3 star because its so run down.",30,563
Caleta Tankah has so much potential if they did some renovations and cleaned up the property. This is the perfect place to go if you're torn between denote or the beach. The caleta was super clear. The cenote is a bit rocky but perfect place to take a dip. The food here is disgusting so don't even try it. The drinks here as well were not good at all. Better just ordering shots. The staff wasn't attentive at all. For $15 cover fee I guess you can't expect much. I would come back just for a chill day for the beach/cenote. But I would definitely eat before coming here.,30,563
"The place is great, but the service is horrible  such a big disappointment for a great place and the poor service, I was waiting for 1 hour for the waiter, and I have to ask for a menu because they dont let u in with food buy they either offer, so I asked for a menu and then I have to wait long time for my order to be taken",20,563
"The beach at Tulum (zona hotelera) was not nice this year, and a local recommended us this place.  We were surprised of how nice the beach was here. The food and drinks were affordable. If we have known of this place earlier in our trip we have had visited it more often.  It is only 20 minutes away from the zona hotelera.  The entrance is 300 Meccan pesos per person approximately $ 15 Dollars per person, which includes the beach chairs, umbrella, and parking. There is a bar, restaurant and bathrooms on site. These were good too.  We will visit again.",50,563
"Stay away of this place, the manager is the most useless person I ever met, thay gave us a price and tried to cheat changing conditions once in place, do not visit them terrible food and service and managed by a beginner with no idea of service. They will try everything possible to take your money",10,563
"Is a beautiful place just next to the archealogical zone of tulum.  We were recommended to go this place by our host in the hotel that we stayed to. In this season there is a lot of seaweed in most of the beach clubs from Tulum, but this is not the case. This beach club is so beautiful and there is no seaweed because the ""caleta"" (a place were  sweet water from the underground rivers called ""cenotes"" meet the salty water from the sea. There is also a cenote a 15 mins walking from the caleta that is also included in the price. Entrance is 300 mxn, some locals told us that a few yers ago the price was just 30 MXN, but for this season come to this magical place worth every penny.",50,563
"My boyfriend  and I’m arrived the last week in May 2021. The drive into the condo area is on a long pot holed road..so do not come in a nice car. We did not mind that..lots of yuccas on either side and iguanas to look at. Sometime they have a manned front gate..but this was very hit and miss. We arrived at our apartment ready to rest after a long day of travel, only to be utterly dismayed...the condo, on the 2nd floor was disgusting. Please see photos to understand how completely awful this place was...black mould on the ceilings, water leaks behind electrical outlets, no light in a disgustingly dirty bathroom, huge stains of goodness knows what on the couches, undefrosted fridge, dirty finger prints every where, stains every where. We refused to stay here, and sweet Ernesto (",20,563
" front desk at beach Caleb )tried to manage the  situation via phone, with the never seen ‘Cesar’. He demanded that we send picture evidence of this awful room. I m still wondering if Cesar if the owner , and according to other reviews ‘the ever present host’ why he needed pictorial evidence of this dump. When we told him we wanted a full refund , he told my boyfriend that HE would have to cancel. Lie Cesar...buyer beware ..if the customer cancels you only get a portion of your money back at best.. ...if Cesar  cancelled 100%.   After 2 hours of this ridiculous charade, miraculously another condo was found for us...ground floor, clean with ac, but not with a lot of the amenities that the condo supposedly came with.  We also had a toilet seat that was not fitted properly so every time my boyfriend sat on it he feared castration, and the sliding glass doors had a cheap lock that stuck often, leaving us struggling to gain entry on several occasions ,and on one occasion we got totally locked out .luckily before 6 pm, so we did manage to get help to access our condo.  FYI....there are 5 condo units here, each containing 6 units, 3 have been renovated,2 have n’t...initially we were put in the un renovated building...why??? For our whole stay( 6 nights, we left a day early due to sawgrass build up and unable to use pool) we only saw about 6 of the 30 condos with people in them.   Pluses of staying here....isolated location , right on beach front and use of a cenote.. Most staff friendly.  Cons...All of the above plus very little cleaning of public areas and spaces. The beach ether side of condos and beach club full of trash making very unpleasant to walk along, very rocky entry to sea.No attempt was made to clean up any saw grass ( which is particularly bad this year)  The beach club was not very clean although the stretch of beach outside of it was ok...pool unusable ( see photos. What is advertised and what you get at booking is not the same.Beach club is not clean. No info given on who to contact after hours or in a emergency.  My recommendation...stay elsewhere..we drove around and found many neat places with great location that were clean and well managed and were cheaper than staying here.I",10,563

"My headphones missed inside the room and it’s been locked all the time!! I’ve sent a message to the hotel but they haven’t answered me since now. Any kind of compensation hasn’t been offered. It’s quite a violation to the right of free property. That all made my last trip days bothering . That never happened to me before. Hope at least they gave me the value of a brand new phone. It was a Jabra elite 75t active.  Don’t recommend.If you go there, take all your valuable belongings with you. Maybe it’s right in front of the beach, but everything is quite far and some objects and installations in the room seem quite old. You definitely will need a car if you host there",10,563
"The Location was amazing. The staff was great. Adriana and Jorge were amazing, they gave us some good hints where to go and what to visit.  Adriana took the extra mile to make our stay absolutely spotless and absolutely unforgettable. We had the best room in the Posada with Ocean view, and every morning breakfast was served in our balcony.",50,565
"Loved staying here, would highly recommend the room with Sea view. The staff are all friendly and while it’s not 5 star luxury, it’s quirky and perfect for simple accommodation to experience Tulum and what it has to offer",50,565
"If you are looking for authentic Tulum charm, Posada Lamar is one of the must-book boutique hotels on the strip.  Still close to the new trendy restaurants and nightlife but enough serenity to enjoy what Tulum was originally discovered for - it’s healing magical charm.  I stayed in the Ocean View Loft Room (Zefiro) which was spacious with a balcony overlooking the ocean. There was a ladder in the room which allowed you to climb up to a private loft area to watch the sunrise or sunset.  There is no door to the bathroom but it is large enough for privacy. No hairdryer is provided so you may want to pack your own.  AC is only available from 9PM-7PM - but the rooms are rather cool enough without it during the day.  The property has decent WiFi but you may have to move around to find",50,565
" the perfect connection. It was strong enough to allow calls and zoom meetings throughout the day.  There are no fridges in the room but the hotel provides coolers so you can purchase ice and beverages from the nearby market minutes (walking distance) down the road.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating.  There is a beautiful pool area with two swings and a sun deck with day beds. Below are more day beds on their private  beach area.  If you need a beverage while you tan - feel free to walk next door to their wonderful neighbor Posada Margherita (no affiliation despite confusing reviews) but BRING CASH, they are cash only. They have amazing food, cocktails and fresh juices. You may be greeted by playful Felice the famous Posada Margherita Pup!   OVERALL: book with Posada Lamar, you will be so happy you did!  CLEANLINESS - so clean SERVICE - friendly & attentive FACILITIES - old Tulum charm & up-kept (safe) FOOD - wonderful complimentary breakfast consisting of fresh fruit, toast, yogurt w/ granola & coffee or tea ATMOSPHERE - such good vibes LOCATION - perfect walking distance to everything you’d want to experience that is “Tulum”",40,565

Lovely little guesthouse - superb location on the beach. We stayed in the big room directly overlooking the ocean - fantastic large terrace to have breakfast every morning which was delicious. Very friendly staff. Two things on the negative side - no bar or snack service although there obviously had been one there recently. The air conditioning time restriction from 9pm - 7am is a bit harsh - the room was extremely hot in the afternoon when we came back from the beach and the free standing fan was not adequate - much better to have had a ceiling fan. But overall value for money compared to overpriced adjacent hotels. There are also lots of beach clubs nearby where you can eat and drink and rent sun beds.,50,565
"What a beautiful little spot, we are so glad we discovered it! Posada Lamar is tucked away in a quiet area on the beach away from the hustle and bustle of all the nightclubs.   We love that it’s a smaller hotel so there’s fewer guests around and each room has its own private entrance. This is great especially during COVID times.   The rooms are very spacious and modernly decorated. The bed is super comfortable and there’s lots of room to put your belongings away onto shelves.   Most importantly! The beach is beautiful! With a private roped-in lounge area, you will always find your own space.   There’s also a pool on the property. While we haven’t used it ourselves, it looks like it would be a nice place to hang out on a day that’s too wavy to enjoy the beach.   The hospitality",30,565
" is amazing. Check-in was a breeze. Front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating. The grounds staff are constantly cleaning the pool, raking the sand, tidying the beach, and tending to whatever needs doing. Daily housekeeping staff do an amazing job refreshing your room.   Breakfast delivered to your front porch every morning consisted of fresh fruit, yogurt and granola, toast and preserves and coffee or tea.  You can add on eggs or hot cakes if you want for an extra charge.    My husband and I have spent 3 nights so far with one to go and we will be so sad to leave this little secret hideaway.   Traveller Tips:  Bring ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper, you will hear a touch of construction noise next door in the morning and some music in the evenings from the restaurant across the road. It wasn’t loud enough to bother us and we both slept really well.   Pick up a styrofoam cooler and some ice from the go-mart so you can keep some beverages on hand.   We highly recommend Posada Lamar if you’re looking for a laid back beach getaway. It’s perfect for couples who want a relaxing beach break. We love it and will be returning the next time we spend a few days in Tulum!",40,565

"Amazing, cozy boutique hotel with best ocean view in TULUM. Super clean ant tidy.   Not to many rooms, so overall we did not feel to many people around. Our kids were super happy about pool. Almost all the time we were by the pool alone   Rooms in this hotel are unique, because of ancient and fantastic design details.  Super warm and pleasant personal.  We always had parking space.  We were afraid, that will be noisy from around places, but we do not hear music from around.  I was fishing in the sea right on the beach and I was very welcome to use staff kitchen to cook our fish. That was amazing experience.  We definitely will be back. Thank You so much for best time in Your hotel.",30,565
"Pros: The hotel itself is actually amazing. We had one of the most basic rooms, which provided everything we needed included a fridge. Enough space.  Taxis always available outside.   Cons: The staffing was just basically non existent. We were there for over a week and we were not told once that we could access the hotel next door for all their amenities including the pool! On check in the lady read out the price of our room and informed us that we had booked our room via booking. Non of which was needed to be read out or made any sense. We should have been told about the amenities next door! When we found out you can imagine how disappointed we were finding out on our final day. There were ample opportunities for them to inform us but they didn’t. Including when I asked for the",30,566
" pool location, I spoke with 2 people. One person said there was 2 pools and the other said something to him in Spanish and proceeded to inform me that the only pool available is in the hotel.   When we asked for water at the front desk we were told they don’t offer that at this hotel and we had to walk to the nearest shop which is about 10 mins away. Only to discover our neighbour receiving room service with a meal and drink the following day! By the way we weren’t informed that we can have room service delivered from next door either. These are the kind of things we expect to be told on check in?  Daily room cleaned: our room was NEVER cleaned to the same standard everyday unless we tipped, room was left with rubbish in it and never replaced with water except on one occasion.When we left a big tip the room was cleaned immaculately and we were left with 2 bottles of water! You can imagine our confusion.   The bikes are no longer free as one reviewer previously stated. $12usd a day.   Tips: Use the hotel next door. The staff there are also more friendly and more helpful! The hotel next door is also really stunning and a great vibe. It will also lead you to the cenote which is free for everyone.   Make sure you lock your door as you share the same door number with a room next door. We frequently had someone trying to come into our room due to this confusion.  Always ask for the price of the taxi before you enter. Prices always vary.",50,566

"Our stay at Hotel Watal was an absolute blast. As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by the most friendly and helpful staff (Didier & Sofia). The apartment is beautiful and clean. As a visitor you get access to all the facilities of hotel Copal which is right across the street: the gym, the spa, a cenote, the restaurant etc. If you’re looking for a peaceful and calming atmosphere, this is the place you’re looking for. Would definitely recommend!",50,566
Copal Watal was very accommodating and staff were amazing. Anything we needed they made sure it got done for us with no hesitation. They were close to all the action. Maybe only about 7-10 minutes away from the strip. I would definitely return back here.,50,566
Such a beautiful hotel would absolutely recommend it!!!!Everything was always clean and the stuff was amazing. The hotel looks exactly like on the pictures showed maybe even better. Would also recommend to rent a scooter or an atv for your stay here because by foot it’s possible to reach a supermarket and the beach but it just makes it easier to drive!,50,566
"Lovely apartment,Fantastic staff  Little bit of a distance to the beach but we hired a scooter in the end easy access to the town,all in all really nice place to stay you can use the pool next door or the one out the back which is regularly cleaned",50,566
We loved staying at Watal. It is perfectly situated in Aldea Zama.  We had stayed a week at their sister hotel Copal Hotel with family - it is equally amazing ! But then we wanted more of an apartment for the last week of our trip so we could work and cook as needed. Watal had a great set up for exactly this. We stayed in a 1 bedroom flat with ensuite. It also had a cute terrace. The staff were lovely and super helpful. We didn’t like the first room we were in but the staff understood and accommodated our request to move to a better room.  We’ll be back :),50,566
"We had a huge, modern stunning apartment overlooking a tranquil pool with lush gardens. The reception staff were really helpful, including Franco, Florentine and the guy who showed us our room/complex. Elizabeth, Senge and team in the restaurant at Copal were great too. Amazing place and a very reasonable price. Highly recommend!!",50,566
"I had a great stay at Watal, downtown is a 15-20 walk if you’re feeling up for the exercise. Franco, Ismael & Brian were very welcoming and accommodating and gave great advise on where to eat and go. There is a beautiful restaurant across the road that you should definitely check out. If you’re concerned about your safety, there is 24/7 security who are very friendly and respectful. The rooms are beautiful and the entire property is clean and refreshing. I had a great experience from the cleaning staff to the groundkeepers. The atmosphere is very  zen  and you can feel the good vibes. I’m not telling you what to do but I am suggesting that you give Watal a try.",50,566
"I loved my stay at Niik Tulum. The room was very clean and so were the common areas. The swimming pool was very cute and loved that I could swim there at any time, really. It is a nice, centric hotel in Aldea Zama and the stuff was the best of my experience, to be honest! On my second day, I rented a bike at the hotel and I totally recommend doing this to move around, it changed my experience completely!",50,567
"Our stay was absolutely great and we enjoyed every minute of it. The area was nice and clean with few nice restaurants nearby. The room was clean, quiet and spacious with comfy beds and AC. The staff was super helpful and friendly. They helped us with transport from airport, bike rental and a Chitzen Itza tour. Me and my parents felt safe and welcomed. Thank you!!  I wouldn't recommend booking the tours through them, but it's more negative towards the tour company EasyTours than the hotel. We didn't fully get what we paid for.",50,567
"You can hear everything through the walls, even the toilet flushes. Its new and clean and the rooms are big, but if you want a decent sleep, forget it. No restaurant and its a distance to get to one. There is no coffee machine in the room or teapot. The price is good for Tulum.",20,567
We visited their hotel in March with 2 children. The hotel was super clean with lovely big rooms. Staff were really friendly always willing to help. Breakfast was thee best absolutely fantastic!! Would highly recommend!,50,567
"The location is nice and secluded from the town, and closer to the beach, which is a huge PLUS! I felt much safer here than what I would of felt in a public resort, tbh. They have really good personel and the food is delightful with the seasonal fruits of the region. Memorable!",50,567
"This place is just perfect. The staff is relaxed, warm, friendly, competent. I was here with my daughter and we both loved it. The hotel is impeccably clean, the food is great, the decor is clean and elegant while still feeling comfortable and in harmony with the natural surroundings.  The staff was very welcoming and there was always someone available to help us. Marcel (or was it Marcelo?) was extremely helpful in helping to orient us, give us local tips, arrange bike use, arrange taxis, etc.  I would recommend this hotel for anyone for any occasion: newlyweds, retirees, families, business travel.",50,567
We threw a retreat at the hotel and it was lovely! The design of the hotel is simply divine. The staff was wonderful and the food from the kitchen was great. You truly have to see it to believe it. Highly recomended!,50,567
"I had a wonderful 10 day at Niik. During the time I was staying there I had some challenges that are every international tourists nightmare.  I cannot begin to tell you how amazing the manager and staff at Niik Boutique Hotel were. They went above and beyond what you could imagine to help me and to make my stay comfortable!  Every person here was friendly,  helpful and professional. The Manager, Alvero was incredibly kind and helpful and Marcel was so helpful,too. The room was clean. And the food at the restaurant was really good too.   It was so wonderful to see smiling faces each day!  If you're planning a visit to Tulum, I highly recommend Niik Boutique Hotel.   I am forever grateful to them and look forward to return again soon!",50,567
"The Niik boutique hotel is located in a very cool quickly developing area of Tulum situated between the beach and downtown with easy access to both. Just minutes from amazing bars, restaurants and the beautiful beaches in Tulum.  The hotel itself is first class including a small restaurant and chef willing to customize meals to your taste. All the staff was extremely friendly, easy to communicate with and knowledgable of the area.  We don't usually brag on but this definitely was a top notch place on our list!  Big Thanks to the fantastic staff for an amazing stay!! We will definitely return!",50,567
"I was greeted with a smile and the service was always very polite and helpful. Room was cleaned perfectly every day and the beds were super comfortable. You could feel the freshness of this hotel, I totally recommend this place! :)",50,567
"Stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed the experience.  Location is very convenient close to all amenities and we did not suffer from significant noise issues. Room was huge and well equipped particularly if you want a bit of self catering.  AC was good, shower pressure ok, towels, bed and bedding of a good standard.   Staff were friendly and helpful albeit a little “sleepy”  Outside space both private and public was a little overgrown and cramped. Breakfast was rather uninteresting.   As I said good but with a little more attention to detail (grounds, breakfast, customer service) could be great  Prices in line with Tulum norm (a little over priced) but overall a sound choice",40,568
"3 night stay in Tulum. The positives: the room (Monet) was large, well presented and clean. Staff were very welcoming and the location very central. The parking had actually only space for 2 cars at the rear, however there was on street parking nearby. The negatives: breakfast was very simple. Very little choice, warm coffee and only available after 8am. Tricky if you have an early departure for tours etc. Wifi was dreadful. Very little connectivity, could easily be rectified with boosters installed in rooms. Not normally an issue but with covid forms and test stuff to access prior to travel it rather is nowadays. Having to go to a local bar to download forms wasn't ideal. Also no room safe or anywhere to deposit valuables. The staff spoke next to no English so was unable to",30,568
 find out if valuables could be left somewhere safe other than in the room. Hotel is nearby a rather loud bar or club so noise was loud until the early hours. Not a problem if you're out yourself until late but can understand it would be a problem if you need an early night. Overall a bit disappointing for the money paid. There are much better value for money hotels within walking distance away from the main road. Unless they rectify the breakfast and WiFi I won't be visiting again. Having said that the staff were very good....,50,568

"This is my little slice of heaven. In the morning they serve all the guests a hand cooked breakfast that includes whatever fresh fruit they are chopping up right in front of you and eggs how you like them (I suggest letting her make them mexicana the way she would eat them. While you can take it back to your room or eat at a little table in the courtyard, we preferred eating at the big table with as many other guests that wanted to join. Me and one of the guys who work here, you'll get to know them all well, had a lot of fun joking with each other all week as we were both working to speak better in each other's language.   They supplied plenty of fresh water in the rooms. Always made us take new clean towels, that are huge and super soft. Super nice and friendly and made it",40,568
" really easy for us. I know waiting on people can't always be fun but they made sure that it always felt like they wanted to do it. If you want this is a place you can do it.   I really can't say enough about this place. If you don't want to stay at a resort, and actually want to experience México and it's people, you have to say in the city. By the way it gives you far more access to everything getting out of those pricey resorts. They are really just for people who want to go to another country but not actually go to that country. This place is perfectly located to give you access to the entire city, the beaches, and all the attractions. If you just want to use the bicycles they provide, you can get anywhere you want to go.",50,568

"We booked one of the condos during our 7 day vacation in Tulum and it was awesome! It felt like we were in a small air bnb with the security and perks of a hotel! The condo was huge and I loved that there was no tv! The bedrooms were the only rooms with AC but the rest of the house had ceiling fans which was not bad at all despite how hot Tulum can get. The complimentary breakfast was so delicious we got it almost every single morning. The staff were super sweet and accommodating and helped us so much with booking taxis and navigating around Tulum. I forgot his name, but the guy with the glasses who worked the front desk was the best! The hotel is right in the center of town so there were TONS of options for restaurants and shopping along with great street vendors close by as",50,568
" well! Everything within walking distance! The only con is that being located in the center of the city it can get noisy at night, but that is to be expected and really didn’t bother me. Overall I definitely would recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a fun stay in Tulum! ",50,568

"A wonderfully comfortable and relaxing place where you can truly be yourself, clothed or not. Beautifully landscaped, large inviting 24/7 pool, hot tub, and bar, and splendid accommodations. Easy access to Tulum and beach. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and sociable, along with providing world class service. Excellent menu and chef onsite. Highly recommended!  This clothing optional resort is best of class in our book. This was our second visit here and we hope to visit again and again. If you want to explore naturism in a casual and nonjudgmental way, this is the place! ",50,569
"Amazing long weekend spent here and we were sad to leave. Truly magical and relaxing, laid back in a tropical paradise. The food was amazing, delicious and plentiful. The chef went above and beyond with gluten free dishes and excellent presentation. No matter what the other reviews may say, we will be BACK. I found the vibe here so chilled out, the room was beautiful, clean, comfortable. The patio to have morning coffee on was like being in a tropical setting. The drinks made by Joel were some of the best we have ever had. Crafted not only with his mixology skills but cared about in a passionate way due to his knowledge and desire to engage many of your senses, olfactory, visual and gustatory with a drink!! He was amazing and taught us so much about mezcal’s, gins and other",50,569
" apothecary like properties of many beverages. Sarah was so wonderful and attentive also preparing drinks, serving food and with such a sweet personality and beautiful smile. Office staff Valentina and Betsy went out of their way to help us in anyway possible. We were lucky enough to talk with many nice people there also and some residents who stay for longer periods during the winter months. When I first met one of them she said “Welcome to your home away from home” and that’s exactly how I felt. If you want a laid back, clothing optional experience in a tropical paradise to entice your senses, food to please your palate and drinks to savor you found your tropical paradise. Thank you Club Intima.",20,569

"We’ve been to Intima before, but this may be the last time. First of all be prepared because the restaurant and the bar have been working different closing and opening hours. This is somehow annoying because you need to go out every single time in order to get lunch or dinner, NOT EVEN COFFEE IN THE MORNING! so annoying!!!. Also, If you’re someone who’s looking for a little party/socialize THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!!! When the bar is open (mostly in the morning) there's this DJ who happens to play the most boring music ever which leads to most of the guests to leave and go over some other places with a better Caribbean vibe. The last straw was when we had to witness how this apparently employee of the resort was yelling at the front desk ladies. Fortunately, we got there on time and",20,569
" that forced her to leave. We felt sorry they had to go through that, since they had been nothing but kind to us every single time we had been there. Hopefully someone teaches her some manners to that lady that lady we found out was called Ana. The only good thing about this place is the attention from the staff, they make the best they can with whatever they have.",20,569

"My wife and I had a most chill and romantic getaway last week.  We could not have been happier with the way our bartender Joel, our cook Joelle, and our breakfast server Maria took care of us.  The sweetest ladies kept our room fresh and spotless the entire stay, and the vibe of our fellow guests and staff has left us missing both, as we reminisce warmly from home.  Thanks all for a fantastic visit!",50,569
I honestly don't know where to start. No electricity or hot water most of our stay!! Rooms are shabby!! Not what was advised or what you pay for!! Tulum is lovely though and definitely a beautiful place to visit,50,569
"First of all let me preface that my husband and I have been in Intima about 5 or 6 times.  We received 4 free nights last year so we went from Nov. 9 - 15 on a whim.   Before you book with them, MAKE SURE TO ASK IF THEY HAVE POWER!  The power was out most of the night and some times during the day, which, of course, affects the A/C, water pressure (there's none during outage), fridge/freezer (don't open it), the stove (better have matches) and internet.  The bar, closed at 6 pm every night (no nighcap or night life) and the hot tub was non-existent (read: cold).  Overall, the cleanliness of the place went down as well - there were leaves in the pool all over (esp. in the little tributaries) as the usual pool person was no longer there.  Speaking of the pool, the pool chairs look",50,569
We really enjoyed our stay at Tago Tulum. The service was amazing and the rooms beautiful. Only regret is we didn’t stay longer. Great small hotel close to restaurants and beach.  The best mojito on our trip to Mexico. The private pool was also amazing. Honestly I couldn’t find anything wrong with our stay! Highly recommend.,50,570
"STAY HERE! You’ll be glad you did!   Luis, Ricardo, Enrique.. all the staff were amazing!  Service was impeccable.. multiple turn-downs and room prep every day.  Fresh veggie arrangements brought to our cabana on the beach- we didn’t even ask for them.  Location is spectacular… place and the service can’t be beat.",50,570
"We were highly impressed! Room was just as seen in the photos (no unexpected surprises).  Staff was super friendly and accommodating.  The a/c was up to par and the water pressure was excellent and hot. The room was cleaned daily, water supplied daily and small refreshment were delivered nightly. Fresh towels, beach towels and robes delivered daily also,  A little something different and sweet every evening. We were greeted with a complimentary cocktail upon arrival and the complimentary breakfast was delicious.  Parking was free and convenient.   I can’t complain about anything here.     Totally worth it!",50,570
"Greeted right away with a welcome cocktail. Early to our reservation so they offered to put our luggage locked up in their office.They have a beach club which was extremely relaxed with sunbeds/chairs/bar. Service here was incredible. We opened the door to our room and our jaws dropped. It was gorgeous! Better than the pictures! Clean, new, modern, had all the essentials.  Air conditioning! Aesthetically by far the best room I've ever stayed in. The balcony was perfect & private overlooking the ocean. We had our own private pool. 100/10 recommend best travel experience.",50,570
"Just returned from a five-night stay at Tago after a few nights spent in Izla Mujeres. Very sweet little place. I love the overall design of the property -- the rooms and spaces are simple and understated, very elegant, and the lush gardens feel green and fresh. It's really lovely to come back to a cool, clean space and dip in the private plunge pool after a day in the heat on the beach or exploring cenotes or tromping through the dusty streets. I found all the staff, from the ladies at the front to housekeeping staff to the attendant who helped us back our car out whenever we left to the servers (Carlos is so nice) to be super kind and helpful. We had breakfast and snacks and found all the food to be very good (including surprisingly good eggs Benedict). The cocktails are",40,570
" definitely weak/skimpy on the alcohol, but they're really inventive and yummy. Two drawbacks I'd cite: 1) there is no real pool, which would be nice as during many months, the ocean isn't pleasant for swimming and the beach is even a bit unfortunate due to an overrun of seaweed, and 2) the whole sand-everywhere-thing including the entry ways/walkways gets old really fast -- you just don't really want sand all on your feet and everywhere else all the time. Other than that though, it's a cute little place that I'd recommend -- a nice respite from the crowds and bustle of the whole Tulum area. ",20,570

"Hello, I would like to share my feedback about staying in Tago Tulum.   1. On the first day of our staying in a hotel, one of the guests stole my shoes,black slippers Versace. In the morning I didn’t find them, so I asked at the reception if someone had taken my shoes. Unfortunately, I didn't get any feedback after 3 days.  On the third day Betty showed me a video where one of the guests (who had already checked out) took my shoes. Betty didn’t have any contact of this person, so she sent an email saying: “in case if you took”, sorry what? IN CASE IF YOU TOOK? She has a video with obvious evidence !  After this silence, nobody asked my contact and I didn’t receive any information from her. 2. Every morning I called the reception and asked for  beach towels, EVERY MORNING.",50,570
" Cleaning staff never  new towels for. Another thing is room cleaning was at 17:00/18:00, so our room was without service almost all day.  3. Every evening we heard  loud music. There is a party near your hotel, so we felt like we had a party in our own room.  4. When we checked out, I asked for a bottle of water at the reception because we had go to  Cancun (2 hours of road), I didn’t even ask  water for free, but I received an answer that we can get only 2 bottles of water during 24 hours, they gave us 2 yesterday, so today there is no water for us! And you call yourselves a ""FIVE STARS HOTEL""!!!!  5. Betty.  This woman should be fired. We asked her  for help for several times.How many times did she help us in the end? - Right- not a single time. Actually, when my shoes were stolen, she did NOTHIG for  three days!!! She was saying: “maybe animals took them, I can’t do anything. And she did nothing, not even took my contact or at least apologize. And one more funny thing, we tan out of body lotion, so I opened the bottle to prove that it was empty. Cleaning woman  just closed the empty bottle of lotion and put it near the hand wash. EMPTY BOTTLE OF BODY LOTION.",50,570

"This hotel was unlike any other that we’ve ever stayed at. The property itself is private, but walk out the gate and you’re surrounded by amazing restaurants and beach clubs. The staff are AMAZING, they will help with any questions and will accommodate you with any thing you need. They are so pleasant and friendly and make your visit feel so personal. Our waiter, Pedro, even started to teach us the Mayan language! The rooms are nice and spacious and come at a great price. The food is fantastic-the included breakfast is a huge plus. The rooms are cleaned every day and are always in tip top shape. If you’re looking for a personalized, rustic experience this is a must stay.",50,571
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  First, I have to mention Armando and Myltha for their amazing customer service. I called them about ten times before our stay and they were so nice and answered all of my questions.  Armando arranged our pick up and drop off to and from the airport and Myltha arranged for our group to rent a van for our cenote day.  They are both such nice people and wish I could have done more to show how much their service meant to us. Second, me and seven other people stayed in the Villa Zanzibar.  It was AMAZING! We enjoyed our private pool every single day. We also took advantage of the free beachfront breakfast everyday.  Our rooms were comfortable and we felt like we had our own little apartment complex all to ourselves on the beach of Tulum.  Another amazing amenity",50,571

Great location and friendly staff. Our spot was located directly on the beach and their little water buckets for the sand on your feet were a nice touch. We also had direct access to the pool. The bar/restaurant is very yummy and the included breakfast beachfront is a plus. Make sure to ask for the ‘welcome drink’ which is like a virgin mojito.,40,571
"This hotel is right off the beach. The views were amazing. Cleo & Fernando our servers were very friendly and welcoming! The staff provided great service, always very attentive to our needs.  We stayed in the Coconut Room which had  an amazing ocean view. Overall, this is a  great hotel to stay at!",50,571
"True old school Tulum— funky, comfortable rooms, incredibly yummy breakfast and the friendliest, kindest staff, supplying us with whatever we needed all day.  The beach was incredible (I recommend purchasing souvenirs right from the local Mayan families that visit you in the beach). The room so nice, the hammocks and seating on our veranda the best!  They were so wonderful to my children and to us— Armando, Cleo, Pedro, Raul… just so great.  We splurged and had Armando arrange one tour — Siam Ka’an, on his reccomendation, and it was amazing.   And sadly, I must say that Tulum is changing— The one caveat was the beach club next door playing the same music every day until 2am.  Noise cancelling devices would do the trick, perhaps?!  Security of the hotel made us feel super safe",50,571

"For our first ever trip to Tulum, we stayed at Cabanas La Luna. Hands down, this boutique collection of rustic bungalows is the essence of classic Tulum. The rooms are spacious, each with private decks or pools, luxury king size beds and AC units for cooling at night. The cabanas are situated around a pool and open-air restaurant, the latter with unobstructed ocean views. And, yes, the ocean is a mere 100 yards from the Cabanas, with private sunbathing areas exclusively serving guests. There are no TVs in the rooms, which was fine for us, but if you are here to watch TV, you are in the wrong town!

So breakdown on the hotel   Service  Unreal . Staff amazing. Willing to help the hotel isn’t huge and I like that like the more boutique style . The staff that work at the bar round the pool are amazing.   Location  You are like 15 min in one direction by taxi from the down town . 15 min the other way by taxi to the beach . Loads of restaurants and beach clubs top restaurants are chill things near by . If like me you like the gym the hotel does not offer one but there is Los amigos gym a max 10 min walk away or bike ride .   The hotel offers cycle bikes between morning and 6 pm . This is really good you can take them out and just bring them back .   Rooms  We had a suite room was so clean so nice liked the extra bit of room and balcony . Lovely lounge area in the suites .  ,40,573

The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything you need. We had a small living room which was nice and a small balcony overlooking the front street. The entire Zama area was still developing so at the time of our stay it was tranquil with stunning views of the surrounding jungle.   The rooftop restaurant was convenient to have breakfast and dinner on days we wanted to take it easy, though I would give the food 3 stars.   We definitely took advantage of the poolside cabanas which were big and very comfortable.   Something to note is that a stay in this area of Zama is highly recommended with a rental car.

"Very chic, new and modern hotel in the newly Aldea Zama neighborhood which is a modern mix where tropical and city meet. For starters the hotel is located in a new section of Tulum that’s “heavily” under construction. If you can see pass the construction you’ll be fine, if construction bothers you stay away. If you’re looking for beach access stay away. The beach is about 10 minutes (taxi), 35 minutes bike, or an hour walk. Speaking of bikes the hotel has them for free to use, which is a nice perk. The hotel pool and view is simply amazing! The hotels rooftop restaurants food is good (ate there twice). The rooms are spacious and new.

" propert.  The area that this is in in my opinion is the best location in the tulum tourist area. We spent a good amount of time in the downtown and it wasn't a far trip at all we also spent some time on the tourist side so you get a taste of everything. It's also quiet compared to the other end closer to the tourist side so it was a very rwalxing experience as well however there are still opportunities to party if that's your thing.  The restaurant attached to the hote is also top tier. Specifically victor he is the best!! Everyone was amazing but to name a couple Victor, Aliena, and Ada really made us feel at home. Also Paco who is on security and grounds service was great!!   Very clean, great service, great food and there is security staff available so you feel very Safe.  They also helped a lot with car bookings, scooter bookings, food and excursion recommendations.  Beautiful fauna and flora around, loved the lizard friends, the beach at daytime and nighttime, and we had massages on the patio that the hotel booked for us it was MAGICAL!!

We stayed in one of the Beach Front Chica, perfect for 2 adults and all very romantic.  We had our own hammocks, seats and sun loungers so all options covered be it shade or sun.  The hotel staff are supremely attentive and friendly.  The hotel operates a whatsapp system to contact front desk or room service and it worked beautifully.  Food in the restaurant feels homemade and authentic and nicely priced.    Couldn’t fault Zamas, would highly recommend and would come back if we were to visit Tulum again.",50,574

I also didn’t want to book 2 different rooms for my small group. I was excited to find Zamas Hotel.  I was happy to book their Coconut Grove Grande to fit all 6 of us in one cute cabana that overlooked coconut groves and literally steps away from the beach.  It fit the experience I was looking for our first trip to the Riviera Maya. The experience began with great customer service from Ileana, Gabi and Danielle who answered many of my questions on WhatsApp before the trip. I am an over planner, but they ",10,574
" answered ALL of my questions that made me a well informed traveler before we arrived.  The best part was that they helped me arrange tours with local contractors to Chitzen Itsa, Cenotes, Sian Kaan, and  even arranged the booking of group massages on the morning of my birthday.  They even arranged for our shuttle pickup and Covid tests before we left. Read the info about the hotel. You will not get a typical American continental breakfast. You will however get the best Mexican food for breakfast lunch and dinner from Que Fresco with food that represents the real local flavor. I don’t care much for continental breakfast, but enjoyed the best chilaquiles, tacos, margaritas, etc. Because the restaurant of Zamas Hotel was voted  one of the best restaurant of Tulum in 2021. Also, if you want water, a fridge or electric kettle, Zamas will provide if you ask, for no extra charge!  Great communication is key and Zamas delivered. My friends and I enjoyed all the amenities as listed above because I asked for them in advance. My friends and I felt well taken care of, all due to the great customer service of Ileana, Gabi and Danielle  (Please Zamas, they deserve a raise).  Zamas is located in the quieter end of the Zona Hoteleria so its’ a great location to relax. This was the ideal location as awesome restaurants and unique shops/ boutiques were all around us. We also enjoyed the convenience of getting cash from a currency exchange place and 7 eleven just 5 minutes walk away. We also enjoyed walking down to the Papaya Playa Project, Azulik, SFER IK, and Kin Toh  ( all major destinations/ landmarks of Tulum) and they were just literally 5 mins walk from the Hotel.  We thoroughly enjoyed the beauty of Zamas the hammocks outside our cabana, the view and sound of ocean and breezes, the amazing restaurant Que Fresco,  the pool that we were able to walk to every day across the street, the amenities provided for us as, stated above.

"This is a great hotel for families, couples, or anyone looking for a nice but much more relaxed hotel in Tulum on some of the best stretches of beach.  We selected the Magnolia villa since this was large enough for our family of four...but it could have easily accommodated at least five.  We were only a few steps from the beach. The space was a great balance of upscale refinement with a heavy bend towards the integration of natural elements including a palm tree literally going through the wall and up through the roof. Most of the other patrons were also looking for a chill place instead of the more party and even adult only scenes at other Tulum hotels.  It was also nice not to have to fight to get a good space on the beach. Each villa has its own dedicated beach ""bed"" and",50,575

We thought it was a bit pricey the first night, but we soon learned that the restaurants in Tulum were more expensive than most others in nearby cities like Cancun.  But, all of our meals were very good. We were very impressed by the included continental breakfast each morning with fresh bread, croissants, fruit, butter, jam, juices and coffee. You can order more, but this was enough for us knowing we would be eating decadently the rest of the day in Tulum.   While we really enjoyed our stay and we would highly recommend this place, there was one detail that caused some stress. The airline had not loaded our bags on our flight to Cancun. Tulum is  2+ hour drive south of Cancun, and we were concerned about our bags reaching is when they finally arrived in Cancun. We asked the front desk if they could help make a few calls to check on our bags. They informed us that there was no phone that the staff can use at the hotel...which also made it challenging to connect with them the day we arrived since we were delayed due to our bags.  It took some repeated requests to get some help but even this was limited. While the rest of the service was very good, I would have expected more from a place that cost over $400/night for our villa. ",50,575

"The most beautiful stay! We feel in our casa on the beach at Casa Violeta thanks to the wonderful staff which feels like a big family from Karla (the stunning and stylish owner), Giampierro (GM), Alex (the famous italian chef from Florence), Carlo (at the reception) and the entire staff as well as  the customers who keep returning.   The italien food is out of this world, like if you were in a restaurant in Italy with extraordinary al dente pasta, thin crust pizza, delicious veggies and daily specials.  A dream! We end up wanting to eat at the hotel every day since it is so good.   For me the best restaurant in Tulum thanks to italian Chef Alex and his team.

"We rented the whole hotel for 2 nights for family and friends while we had our wedding in Tulum. Carla and Giampiero were super helpful on the lead up to us travelling from the USA and helped with all our questions and needs.  Giampiero and all the staff were very nice and accommodating for our big group.  My wife and I stayed in the largest room, Magnolia. It had a large downstairs with a double bed and also an upstairs with a bed too with a great view of the ocean. I would have liked it to have had AC but we had 2 fans and opened the windows at night which had a nice breeze from the ocean.  All of the food was excellent, Breakfast and Dinner. We had also organised a welcome party for all the guests (and other friends who were in town) for dinner and Casa Violeta did an",30,575
"Wonderful, authentic Mexican Caribbean experience with the most hospitable people in the world. Everything is always wonderful and we love going back as much as possible. We have been coming to the island for years and this is always our favorite place. Located in the colonias, you can watch kids play soccer, be near the beach or experience a local carnival or Mercado. And there are lots of friendly animals all around. ",50,576
"We stayed in the Luna apartment for three nights which was great. It's really spacious for two people. The kitchen is well equipped, the bathroom is nice, the bed comfortable, AC and fans available, TV, DVDs, books... so many little details that were just nice! Wish we could have stayed longer.  Sue was great with all our questions and the people that lived on the ground floor were lovely. The taco stand down the road is great. My husband ate there every night. Bear in mind though that the apartment is at the south end of the island, maybe a 10 minutes taxi ride (40 pesos) away from the main town, harbour and most popular beach (playa norte). However the south end offers the turtle center and some other nice beaches. If you want to stay somewhere quiet, spacious and affordable",50,576

"Gracias Sue y Miguel.  We found this place by accident as we were without a place to stay our last week on Isla.  Sue and Miguel met us and showed us the apartment and we rented it for 6 nights.  The apartment is huge with a large livingroom, kitchen and bedroom.  The rooms are kept clean and sparkeling.  When we had a little issue with the microwave it was replaced almost immediately.  The neighborhood was wonderful and relaxing and sitting on the patio watching the children at the kindergarten while having morning coffee was a wonderful way to start the day!.  Thanks again.  If we hadn't gotten a place for next year we would be back.  We will / have recommend this to anyone we know.",50,576
"We recently stayed at Capis apartment for 10 days while visiting family on Isla Mujeres, with our 3 month old baby. What a GREAT place. The apartment was very clean, and fully stocked with everything one would need. The space was large and comfortable, and so were the beds! Sue and Miguel were super responsive and their dog, Loco was super cute too!  Loved being able to walk to the grocery store and taco stands, there's a bakery just around the corner as well.  We loved watching the little kindergartners coming to the school across the street and singing and dancing their day away. An excellent location for those who truly want to be immersed in the local island culture. It was a joy to stay here and we just hope that Sue and Miguel would have us back again in the future!",50,576
" We booked to stay for 3 nights and ended up staying 3 weeks in the Luna studio! Sorry this is a long one but I feel like we need to do this incredible place justice.  This great studio has a decent size bathroom and a kitchen equipped with everything you need.  My husband and i had been staying in a hotel in playa del Carmen and were really looking forward to home cooked meals which was so easy while staying at Capi's. There is a huge supermarket a 15 minute walk away or 15-20 peso taxi ride. A smaller super market is closer if you need too. Miguel brings up a 20litre tank of filtered water for only 25pesos whenever you need it. This is so convenient not having to carry huge bottles around and so cheap!   We spent our days reading in the hammock on the balcony, and swimming at",50,576
" garrafon national park (only $US5), dining at mango cafe and shopping downtown. Next time we stay we plan to come with friends and have a dinner party in the outdoor area!   Sue and Miguel were the most lovely hosts and they went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. When they couldn't accommodate us for a few nights as another person had booked the studio they drove us round to alternative hotels and their other apartments in their golf cart. They also showed us around the island on this cart.  When we were worried about tropical storm Ernesto Sue gave us regular updates via email ( which by the way is a great connection) and offered for us to come and stay the night at her place! It was so comforting knowing that we had hosts who we could turn to in that situation which is so foreign to us Aussies!  The apartment is very clean ( I am a clean freak who is very picky!) the linen, towels & cleaning gets done every 3 days by the incredible house keeper Gilma.  If you are looking for a relaxing stay on the island which is amongst the locals not tourists this is the perfect place for you. You cannot beat this value for money.   Cannot recommend this place highly enough.  ",40,576

"My granddaughter and I recently stayed at Capi's.  This was a beautiful, large, breezy apartment.  There was ample room and the place was well-equipped.  A complete kitchen made it easy to cook the local cuisine.  One of our favorite spots in this apartment was the second floor patio area.  It was such a treat to enjoy a cup of morning coffee with the sights and sounds of the neighborhood. Late evenings meant resting in the hammock and watching local cable TV.  We were so comfortable at Capi's, it immediately felt like home.  The service was excellent and the owners were available for anything that we needed.  Sue and Miguel are wonderful, warm people.

"I chose Apt. 3A because of the history of it being the home and studio of the artist/proprietress of Casa Isleño, Henrietta Morris de Avila.  It was a spacious room right on the parade route.  If there were any traditional processions taking place, we only needed to step outside to enjoy them, and in the short time of our visit, there were a few!  Altogether, the location was amazing.  Just steps from restaurants, shops, the beach right around the corner........within a few days, we were navigating the streets with ease, walking everywhere.  People were so friendly, it wasn't long until we began seeing familiar faces and exchanging greetings.  Though busy during the day, by around 10pm the streets were quiet.    We had the great fortune to be visiting when Rob was there working",40,577

He made sure we had everything we needed and detailed the best spots for food, golf cart rental, etc.  There were plenty of towels, a coffeemaker, fridge, bottled water, a hotplate.....but really, with the exception of some snacks, fruit and beverages in the fridge, there was no need for cooking.  Fresh, delicious, varied, and inexpensive food was widely available.    We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and I like to think that we got a sense of the slow yet celebratory pace of the way of life on the island.  We look forward to another trip to Isla Mujeres.",40,577

"My same-sex partner and I had an INCREDIBLE time on the island, thanks to the hospitality shown to us by Casa Isleno. Rob called us as we booked and we chatted for about half an hour about the island, giving us a great sense of welcome, then his cousin Marie greeted us upon our arrival and drove us around the island by golf cart, showing us everything (including a statue of her grandfather!) and even took us to the supermarket to pick up items.   The house itself couldn't be more central to town and we were at the beach within 10 lazy minutes, bars and shops within 3 minutes, and in heaven within seconds.  The only downside was that we weren't there long enough. Will be remedied next time!  Thanks for a great, relaxing trip!",50,577

The private beach is one of the best I've seen. The sand is raked daily and there were plenty of chairs for our group of 8. Also umbrellas for shade of we wanted.  Zama's beach club is a short walk down the road and has good food and drinks and a pool if you want a break from the beach.  I really can't say enough good things. Highly recommend!!!",50,579

About 100 peso taxi ride from the ferry port. Pretty view of Cancun at night. Being on this side of the island, the water is calmer. I'd recommend renting a golf cart for the freedom/convenience, but taxis do seem to be relatively plentiful in the area. There's a beach club, ""Ice Bar,"" a place that sells chilled coconuts, a hotel with a decent Italian restaurant, and a nice set menu restaurant within walking distance. It's about a 10-15 minute golf cart ride to the grocery store and 15-20 minutes to downtown.  Beach  Beach is great. Definitely private. Quite wide and deep. Soft sand. Nice for",30,579
" relaxing or playing games. House has an assortment of beach games/toys. They even comb it every morning which was nice. The downside to us was the water. Super squishy with seaweed or whatever is growing there. Water socks help a bit, but not that much. It just felt weird being in it. When we wanted water, we ended up going to the Zama beach club a short walk up the road. Mexico doesn't seem too stringent when it comes to protecting seaweed so it seems like an opportunity to clean it up and make it nice.  House:   There's going to be some criticism here. I get that it's not a Park Hyatt and it doesn't mean we didn't enjoy our time in Isla Mujeres. If a friend was loaning us the house, it wouldn't matter, but this isn't that.  At this price point my expectations were higher for quality and maintenance standards.  It would have been nice to have a basic instruction manual. Wi-Fi passwords. Cable channel guide. That kind of thing. We do this every year and this is the first time we haven't had this when we arrived.  The house is very spacious. Plenty of room for a large group to be together or for people to find a quiet corner to read or nap. Multiple TVs with Cable TV/DVD players. Furniture in the downstairs main living room was on the dingy side and well worn. Armrests on chairs felt damp with sweat/suntan lotion/something. Swivel chairs were very squeaky. Internet worked well with multiple devices using it, but it's three separate networks. One with no password on the main floor. One on the second floor with a password we eventually found and one on the 3rd floor with a password we never found. The caretakers couldn't seem to help with this.  There are kick stands on many of the doors throughout the house. Use them. If you don't, you will be subject to constant slamming due to the pressure changes resulting from all of the windows being open all of the time. Most of the doors need some WD-40 or some type of lubricant. They're very squeaky.  Kitchen  Well appointed. Nice gas range. 2 refrigerators. Good mix of pots and pans and a variety of small appliances and cooking tools. You can easily prepare nice meals for a small group. The BBQ grill needs to be put out to pasture. It's done. Completely rusted out and difficult to light. Dishwasher is pretty weak and needs repair (replaced really).  Big problem in the kitchen: There is a MAJOR infestation of ants. I'm talking about leaving a single empty glass that orange juice had once been in in the sink being covered with ants (70-80 of them) within 30 minutes. The team at the house used nearly a whole can of Raid which controlled them for half of a day, but then it was as if nothing had been done after that. This is not ""tropical life."" I know tropical life. Basic and consistent pest control would take care of this.  Bedrooms  Bedrooms are quite spacious and all have little A/C units which were very efficient. Mattresses seem beyond their usable life. Sheets were thin and pilled. Pillows were cheap foam. It doesn't need to be Frette, but it's time for something new. Avoid the 3rd floor bedroom. Tiny bathroom. You literally cannot stand in front of the sink with the door open. Small table, but no real counter space. Shower takes about 5-6 minutes to get hot water up to it. Shower head it pretty rusty. Mirror is small and hung at an inexplicably low height. I'm average height and needed to bend over to see myself in the mirror to shave. Bathroom and bedroom are not en suite (unlike the other rooms) and for some reason they are on a different level than the hallway that connects them. The hallway, by the way, is where the closet is.  Grounds  It's a pretty massive lot with a lot of trees. At first glance they look super nice, but after a week of looking at them every day, they aren't that well maintained. The lawn is mostly crab grass and weeds. Trees need trimming. I didn't care, but I noticed.",50,579

It is a block from the main drag (a bonus!) so the room was quiet and a block or so from the beach. On the negative side I was only able to get an internet connection in my room once in the week that i was there, and for a very short time, and could barely get connected sitting in the hot passageway in front of the office. My room was up steep stairs so if you have a knee problem, as I have, be forewarned. I nonetheless chose that room",40,580

This was great news because there doesn't seem to be a room left on the island. While I received a confirmation from Despegar, stating that I could just show up at the hotel and pay at that time, I wanted to make sure I actually had a room.  Called the hotel owner, Don Nibardo, this morning.  He hasn't had rooms available for those dates for quite some time, and does not work with Despegar.

Close to a really terrific and well supervised playground, a bunch of local eatery/restaurants and shops, even a grocery store and an open-air market (don't miss the tortillaria on the corner) all make this a wonderful place for folks with small kids to enjoy a vacation.  Our son (6 yo) loves coming to Zina's where he can play card games or gaze up at the stars from the rooftop patio of the apartments (also where there's a small pool to splash around in). He's also a big fan of Punta, the House Dog! We stayed in the apartment upstairs, conveniently located close to said rooftop patio where we often enjoyed our breakfast. ",50,581

She will introduce you to the best places to watch the sun rise, the easiest beaches for families with kids, and the most amazing food on the island.  She can provide you with info. on anything from cheap eats to yoga classes, and she knows just where to find the best bang for the buck (well, peso) so you, too, might find yourself wanting a return trip.

I love that I could walk out the door and have a small pool for dipping and the pool area was so wonderful day and night.

"We originally had reservations to stay at an apartment mid-island, but unfortunately there was a booking mistake and our apartment was not available.  The owner checked around to find us another place to stay and we were told that there was space available at Zina's Guest House. Because of the fact that it was high season and we were looking for last minute accommodations, we decided that we would give it a try.  To begin with, Zina was most hospitable.  There was fresh bread and some supplies in the fridge (a few cold beers, ham and cheese) which I felt was a very nice touch.  In looking at the website, it sounds like an ideal place to stay.  Unfortunately it did not turn out that way.  The apartment itself is quite run down. The website talks about ""luxurious Egyptian cotton",30,581
" sheets"".  The sheets on the double bed were indeed Egyptian cotton, although probably 10 years old and had seen much better days.  When the sheets were changed after 7 days, the next ones were labeled ""Polyester - made in Pakistan"".  The second bed in the room, a twin bed, had no sheets on it when we arrived.  I found one sheet in a box in the kitchen and put it on the bed myself.  The bedroom has 3 windows.  Two of the windows have heavy curtains, but the third window, the largest one, has only a nylon cafe curtain which provided no privacy at night once the bedroom light was on.  None of the window locks worked and there were no screens on any windows.  The website indicates there is cable TV available.  There was a TV in the room, but we were told there was no cable, so TV did not work.  We were told not to use the air conditioner any more than necessary.  We decided to turn it on the second night we were there to hopefully drown out some of the noise.  It certainly did as the AC sounded like a 747 about to take off.  So the choice was either listen to constant dogs barking, traffic and music, plus the noise coming from a local bar about 2 blocks away which went on until 4 or 5 in the morning, or the loud AC.  The kitchen is very small and poorly lit.  There were several electric applicances but little countertop room to use them.  The dishes and silverware were in need of replacement.  Most of the dishes had been damaged by overuse in the microwave. There is a small window in the kitchen which looks down into the courtyard of the house next door.  These people have 2 dogs, both of whom stay on the patio all night.  When they bark, and they both bark very, very often, the sound bounces off all those surrounding cement walls.  The bathroom has no door (just a shower curtain hanging across the doorframe) and measures approximately 4' x 5'.  There is a very small window, which cannot be opened because there is no handle.  Therefore there is no ventilation in the bathroom, which as I mentioned, has no door and opens directly into the kitchen.  Not a good thing.  When you are sitting on the toilet, your feet are actually in the shower stall.  There is no stopper in the sink and no electrical outlets at all.  After being there for 4 nights and neither of us getting any sleep because of all the noise, I informed the owner that we were not satisfied with the accommodations, needed our rest and wished to leave and wanted our remaining money refunded.  Her reaction was to tell me that she could not give us our money back, but we could leave if we wanted to.  After a few more days we were informed by the owner that she had gotten some money so that we could leave.  Her first offer was for $100.00 less than what was owed. I told her that was not acceptable and she then said she had the other $100.00.  We left the following day.  I think Zina has come up with what she considers a great marketing strategy.  On her website she talks about ""having a true cultural experience in the colonia"" which in reality translates to staying in a run down apartment in a very noisy neighborhood and having to deal with a difficult person.",50,581

"I spent almost a month at Zina's. I loved the little apartment and roof patio, where I would have my morning coffee and watch the world of la gloria going on around me. The apartment was clean and welcoming when I arrived. There were basic provisions in the kitchen, cold beer, milk, and condiments. Coffee and tea were also provided. Books, magazines and wireless. Toward the end of my stay a friend joined me, and we moved the single bed into the 2nd room to give us both some privacy. The pictures on the website don't really show how big the apartment is. It looks like a studio, but is actually 2 large rooms. We were sorry to leave. Every morning I would walk through the park across the street to the municipal market for my daily litre bottle of fresh orange juice, (25 pesos), and",50,581
"I reserved and paid for 6 nights since july via despegar.com. When I arrived to the place it was very crowded,  full of local families, the service is expensive and bad. The new manager did not respect my reservation because she said they are working in an independent fashion, so I lost my money and had to pay for another hotel. Don't go there it is not worth anymore.",10,582
"A great place to stay in cabanas direcly on the beach at Isla Blanca! Each cabana has its own hammock in front of the cabana to relax in after a sunny day on the beach. Be sure to bring a flash lite, cause the place get its electrical power from a diesel generator that is put out during the night.",50,582
"This is not on Isla Mujeres, it is on the mainland, 20 miles or so north of Cancun. However, it looks like it was flattened by a hurricane and never rebuilt. I booked a cabana, thinking it was on Isla Mujeres, then couldn't find any way to contact the owner to cancel so I left the island and tried to find this place. After a very expensive cab ride, we found the entrance to this place, but it was seriously scary looking and appeared abandoned. Additionally, there was a large hotel under construction nearby and literally hundreds of men milling about on the roadside. I did not feel safe at all. I was never able to contact anyone to cancel and get a refund. Very disappointed.",10,582
"I have been blessed with one week in what heaven has to be.  It was in Pirata Morgan, natural cabanas, in Isla Mujeres, 15 min from crowdy Cancun... We found this place by hasard and ""after buts and doubts"" we appeared at Roberto's (the faboulous owner) last piece of paradise.  Cabanas are simple and clean, no lux but no fuzz either, you have all what you need and if not Roberto can provide.  He is the personal chef there, and you will be surprised every morning with his spectacular mexican delicacies, always served like in a chic restaurant but in the quietness and beauty of a corner of paradise.  We woke up every morning with the uprising sound of palms and waves.  Straight to early ocean bath and after long walk (more of 10 km virgin beach where you are happily alone) a smoky",50,582

"Our extended family, ages 5-50 years has booked two vacations with Meaghan from Isla Vacations.  Meaghan makes the process look and feel so seamless.  Meaghan is truly a professional and one individual our family will continue to work with for our future vacations to the beautiful island!  Dustin",50,583
"Stayed for 6 nights, whole house for a girls trip and plan to come back in July with kids.  So many great things to say!  1) Location - perfect for us!  Mid island and half way to everywhere, we walked downtown (20 minutes), Mango Cafe (5 minutes), Mike’s Pizza (6 minutes), Madera Food and Art (15 minutes maybe.). DaLuisa restaurant is next door and really fabulous - we ate there twice.  We did have a golf cart and really found it convenient and fun to go all around the island.  Cabs were also very easy out the front door.  Loved being close to Colonia, food and local folks 2) House staff Meaghan was great to work with in advance and east to pay deposits with check in mail (no fee) and also used PayPal (little fee.). LOVED Drew who helped us with a few maintanace things at the",50,583
 house and Marcella who met us to let us in and did our pre grocery shopping for only a $15 fee plus tip.  Great to get off the plane and have some chips and wine waiting for us! 3) house itself - what a great set up for the price!  I did tons of research on house options and for the money lt definitely was the best bang for our buck.  The iguanas by the pool love fruit and cut up canned vegetables but our most favorite was a local stray cat who appears to have adopted the home... he was so much company and not a bother and this is coming from not a cat person.  If you go he likes a bowl of water and a can of tuna (Marcella said don’t feed the cat!  But we couldn’t help it!).  Air conditioning was good in 3 bedrooms but struggled in one of the upstairs rooms but not a big deal.  The main area not air conditioned was also totally fine as the breeze is so strong and cool.  The roof at night amazing and the palapal during the day very cool.  (It was mid to upper 80’s/feels like mid 90’s when we were there) Each upstairs room and bedrooms on main floor have their own key - only suggestion is maybe a programable lock for better access.  We hid our upstairs keys most of the time so roommates weren’t locked out and the key was always nearby.  Felt very safe the whole time both at the house and island overall.  Loved it and excited to come back again... please feed the cat if you see him (little all black male with beautiful green eyes)!,50,583

"Casa Luna Turquesa is a wonderful mid-island oceanfront home.  There is a spectacular ocean view, the sound of the waves rolling in makes it the ideal place to just let all your stress fade away!  Away from the crowds of Centro but an easy walking distance to several restaurants and shopping. Richard and Linda, the owners, have provided every thing you need for a comfortable stay. They are wonderful hosts! There are sitting spaces both on the ocean side and the street side, so no matter what the weather, there is always an outdoor place to relax! It just doesn't get any better than this!",50,583
"We had a wonderful time in Casa Luna Turquesa. The house had everthing we needed and the location was perfect, right on the water and a great pool to swim in.Really loved the palapa for our morning coffee and evening cocktails. Large supermarket a few blocks away for all our grocery and beverages.Good restaurants fairly close and the downtown area is a pleasant 20 minute walk. Would definitely return.",50,583
"We spent the week before Christmas at Casa Luna Turquesa. Wonderful time to be on the island and staying at this most amazing centrally located property. Dont worry that there is no address, just tell the taxi driver the name of the house and it is across from the school (literally 5 minutes from ferry.) The home is on the Caribbean side, so you have constant wind and waves, which keep you cool and fresh. As we visited the other areas, we really appreciated  returning to it's location. You are steps to neighborhood restaurants and groceries, which adds to its convenient location. We were able to see two different golf cart parades, since it was the holiday which made it even more special. We did NOT rent a golf cart or car. Taxis run every 2-3 minutes and at 50 pecos, you cannot",40,583
" beat not having to drive. The neighbors are fantastic and friendly, giving us the sense we were home away from home. We had five adults in our group and there was plenty of room in and outside.  You cannot go wrong booking this home from Richard and his wife. Cheers and enjoy.",30,583
…,50,583
"Our family has stayed many times at Casa Luna Turquesa. We love the house and have always felt very safe there. As children and now teenagers our kids love the large pool and the location. This last stay was in the summer so the highlight of our trip was watching the giant sea turtles come up onto the beach to lay their eggs at night. We also swam with the whale sharks and went scuba diving on the reefs, which was amazing!  The house itself offers lots of room and privacy for family and friends vacationing together. Because the house is located beachfront on the Caribbean side of the island the views from every room are spectacular, the breeze off the ocean is welcoming, and we love the sound of the waves rolling in. The kitchens are very well appointed and the gas BBQ is",50,583
"This is one of my favorite places on Earth. I've stayed at every house/condo/apartment Punta Piedra has to offer & I've never been disappointed. The location on the island is absolutely perfect, the property/rooms are clean, not only stocked well but stocked thoughtfully to make sure you're comfortable & simple enough to meet your needs without taking away from the beauty of the beach. Don't miss the sunrises - they are breath-taking & definitely worth waking up early to see!",50,584
"Third stay at this property.  The location right on the water cannot be beat.  To hear and smell the ocean breeze all day and all night is a real treat. This is a simple, clean accommodation not for those seeking luxury but perfect for experiencing the real Isla.",50,584
"This is for Punta Piedra 2 lower unit.   The studio was perfect for my needs. It was super clean, well stocked, completely comfortable at a great location. The beach while not swimable is great for walking along and collecting seaglass and shells. The pool was awesome for chilling while listening to crashing waves. Amy the owner was lovely and accommodating. Checking every day to make sure I was ok. Amy’s gorgeous dogs came over to socialize every morning so I had canine companionship. The bed was very comfortable which is sometimes hard to find. It’s a quick taxi into town or an easy cart ride to everything isla has to offer.   I go to Isla several times a year and this is my new fave. I really can’t say enough about the place. ",50,584
"My family and I stayed at Punta Piedra June 20 for 7 nights. We rented all 5 units. The units were clean, Pool was cool, Beach access was amazing. pictures on site are accurate, We took Taxis the first 2 days for about 50 peso then rented scooters the last 5 days. Amy and Louis were great hosts. We will be back for sure,",40,584
"This was our second stay at Punta Piedra and our first at Punta Piedra 2.  We stayed in the lower unit for a week and it was wonderful.  The location, right on the water, can't be beat.  Waking up to a beautiful sunshine and enjoying a refreshing ocean breeze all day long was wonderful.  While this isn't the best location for swimming, you can walk along the beach, find sea glass and shells, and wade in the water.  Also, Playa Norte and its beautiful beaches are a 20 minute walk away.   If you are high maintenance and looking for all inclusive resort comforts, this is not the place for you.  if you are looking to relax and enjoy the non touristic parts of the island, you will love it here.",40,584
"My husband and I just spent 4 nights at Punta Piedra II.  Amy and Louis were very helpful hosts looking after all our needs.  The room is clean, spacious and has everything you need.   The king size bed was comfortable.   The kitchen equipped with everything you need. It is less than a 30 minute walk to Playa Norte and there are several good restaurants within 15 minutes walk to the south.  We would stay here again. ",40,584
"This review is actually for Punta Piedra II, the upper level. We rented it from 10/12/16 to 10/26/16. Same property, but it is the south building.   Our first day we had a bit of a problem, but we discussed it with Amy, and it was resolved immediately, so I won't discuss it further. She took care of business, and actually did way more than she needed to.   Overall, PP II was exactly what we were looking for: our own quiet little place right on the ocean that we could call ""our own"" (for a few days). We both very much enjoyed the balcony, the view, the sound of the ocean and just being pretty much alone.    The properties are simple, but that's really what we wanted. They're not run down, dark, or musty, or bug filled, etc. They're not the Ritz Carlton. They are simple, quaint,",50,584
" cozy, and in their own way feel like a home away from home.   This side of the island isn't good for snorkeling (at least in October), but we knew that going in so that was not a detractor. And from this location, you can reach the best beaches on the island by taxi in 5 minutes for $4 US (or you can rent a golf cart for your stay, like we did... we rented from Prisma... but that's another review...). What you get instead is some clean views of the ocean, some wonderful waves, and the (almost) unmolested sound of the ocean (as unmolested as you can get nowadays). The beach was quiet, and we enjoyed our time on it. The balcony was a very good size and we enjoyed it very much... it was the first place we went in the morning, and the last place we went before going to bed.    The bed was comfortable, and we had plenty of pillows. The kitchenette was better than some apartment kitchens I've seen, and was plenty good enough for the 2 of us. Loved having a regular refrigerator.   Didn't care for the toilet.... it didn't flush well; It sometimes took 2 to 3 flushes to get rid of things....  The front door could stand to be changed. It is a hollow-core door, so it doesn't kill the sound of the traffic out front on the road. Changing to a solid door would go a LONG way to minimizing the sounds outside.   Although we had no problems with the bed, I wish it was lifted about 6"".... it would have been the perfect place to store our suitcases out of the way. Just a thought... not a gripe.   We never had a problem with hot water. The AC had no problems either. The kitchen has it's own mini hot water heater, so good hot water for the sink was readily available. Plenty of cups, dishes, pans, forks, knives, etc for what we needed to make breakfast, lunch and dinner.   There IS a safe in the room, in case you are wondering. Oh, and WIFI worked perfect!  Apparently, Amy has a cat. We did not know this before arriving. We thought it was a stray. By the time we knew it was hers, we had already gave it a name (Hammie). She told us the proper name, but I don't remember it... so I'm sticking with ""Hammie"". Hammie was a treat. We love cats, and Hammie was a sweetie.   Having stayed on the island several times, I'd say this has been our most memorable accommodation. I would not hesitate to stay here again.     Having been in construction all my life, I'd love to work on this place. Not because anything is really wrong.... more because the place inspires my ""Bob The Builder"" side. It's like a very nice canvas, and I just want to put my touches to it. :) That's just me though!   A great big thanks to Amy for having us as her guests. It's a trip we'll never forget. We REALLY hope to visit again. Hope she found the present we left for her on the kitchen table.",30,584

"We stayed 8 days at casa arriba (2 bedrooms apartment in punta piedra) with my 1 1/2 year old son and husband. I have good points and bad points too to review unfortunately :( The apartment is clean, not very modern but the price is not that high so no complaint. The owner of the place, named Amy, is a really good and nice person.  The person that is taking care of the apartment for her is not very helpful, especially before the booking. Not willing to help, very short on explanation whereas it was our first time.  Even though you pay not that big price at punta piedra, you expect to have a better quality. Amenities are poor (we could not have a decent shower in these 8 days as the shower was just a little water jet and it was impossible to shower with that), Minimum appliances",50,584
"Great place, clean, near everything downtown. We practically had the pool to ourselves.  You can access the malecon and it is generally quiet. Would definitely stay again. Also we were able to park our golf cart in an empty lot next door. Mainly watched Netflix on the TV at night. Also coffee was provided which is great for the first day waking up,",50,585
"I stayed at the Xalapa room. The view is the most beautiful both during the day and at night because you see the sunrise and the moon is reflected in the sea, which is the glory. Super spotless, clean, good smell. I would stay a thousand times more in this place. The pool is small but enough for my children to play. The pool is shared with others in the village but there was never anyone so we only used it ourselves. He had coffee, microwave, drinking water. That little house is really a beauty. The decoration is super cute, especially the Don Quixote paintings that fascinated me. I have no complaints.",50,585
"We stayed in Villa Cozumel for a week in January 2021 - COVID times.  The villas was spotless and we couldn't have been more pleased with how clean it was and everything was in great condition.  You can tell they take care of their property and it showed in Cozumel.   The villa is on the 3rd floor with only stair access.  It has THE MOST amazing views from the balcony off of the room.  The balcony was pretty windy, but not cold.  We were told by a local that it's the trade winds or time of year, but we still very much enjoyed our time overlooking the Malecon and ocean.   The kitchen is equipped with full size fridge, microwave and electric stove top.  there is a coffee maker with filters and coffee as well as a huge jug of water to use.  plates, utensils, glass - all provided.

" Living area was comfortable with two couches (futons maybe?) and a 4 person table.  One tv in the villa and that was in the living area.  this area also had a ceiling fan. bathroom had numerous towels, hair dryer and was spacious.  the shower head left a lot to be desired and would be the only thing I would say wasn't up to par.   bedroom had a ceiling fan and it's own A/C unit, no tv.  the bed was very comfy too. Plenty of places to plug in and charge electronics. Two pools - we only used the one closest to our villas and enjoyed it.  The notice poolside says it closes at 6pm which we thought was very early, but something to be aware of.   Overall it was very quiet and we hardly saw other guests, just knew others were around.  There is a person in the ""lobby"" area who can answer questions and security on at night. Overall, we felt safe and secure and since the place was kept so clean and hand sanitizer was everywhere, we felt they did a great job during COVID.   I would definitely recommend.",50,585

A gorgeous villa style apartment.. beautifully equipped...balcony overlooking the Malecon..we stayed in Campeche.

The pools were handy, but unfortunately I wasn't able to use due to no ladders which I dearly missed! I have 2knee replacements. I also recommend a railing on The walkway stairs out front to the ocean. The cleaning crew and staff where very good! I will return! Isladreams.Com",50,585

Villa San Miguel is close to everything...a small grocery store just around the corner, a short walk from the ferry, close to Playa Norte and close to great shopping and restaurants.  The owner is quick to respond to all questions and the staff are friendly and accommodating.  We had friends in 3 other units and they were all lovely places to stay.",50,585
"My husband and I recently stayed for a week at Villa San Miguel in the Veracruz villa. To say it was wonderful is an understatement! It was very clean, quiet, and spacious. The location was incredible - a short walk to the ferry, to the downtown restaurants, and to the beach.  There is also a local grocery store (incredibly inexpensive) around the corner and we purchased groceries, wine, and needed supplies there.   We stayed in the Veracruz villa and I would absolutely recommend trying to get that villa. It's on the top floor so it's a bit of hike with all of the stairs, but the view is unparalleled. You look out over the ocean for the sunrise and also have a view of the sunset over the city from the side of the balcony.  As for golf cart renting, this villa is so close to",50,585
 everything on the North side of the island that we only rented one for a day to explore the South side. There is a place right next door to the villa if needed.   We will absolutely be back!,50,585

We spent several days in the Penthouse suite and really enjoyed it. Very nice space with huge bath and dressing area. There was a porch that we used every night that overlooks the bar and the ocean. Do be aware that there are quite a few steps so it is not handicap accessible. That's just an fyi.,50,586
Stayed here for a week in October in the Penthouse suite. Glorious- the guest house piece might be the best kept secret on the island. Room is beautiful and being steps away from the strongest margaritas on planet earth didn't hurt either. Mal and Sally are amazing hosts and the bar staff are the kindest group of people around. Poncho the Iguana is the greatest lizard around and the sunsets are spectacular!,50,586
"Off the sidewalk, up an alley and around the corner and you arrive at the coolest bar on Isla Mujeres. Home of the best margarita anywhere, the Soggy Peso is authentic Mexico-Caribbean beach casual. Linger over drinks and attach a souvenir to any space you can find while just chilling out. Take a few minutes or a few hours to get in the mood and you won’t regret it!",40,586
"This is a MUST stop of the island.  We’ve been coming to Isla for about 9 years and always come to soggy peso.  The food is always great, margaritas are stiff and delicious and always had wonderful service.  Even have stopped here with our small kids and although it says no kids they have always been more than happy to accommodate us. The fajitas are amazing but honestly hadn’t ever had anything but good food here.",40,586
"We booked and confirmed a table for 15 on Thursday. We arrived and spent 11500 pesos there. We had an average burger, and average service. However, we then received abusive, threatening and aggressive email on the Friday night as we allegedly hasn't turned up for our table. The owner had the wrong dates and rather than apologise to us (it also happened to be our wedding night he sent the email threatening us to leave the island) he continued his barrage of abuse.   Considering the man has taken advantage of his best friend who owns skull(the much better bar nextdoor) has a reputation the proceeds him for his agression and is serving margaritas that taste like the premade mix from Costo, I think he would do well to stop threatening people for his own organizational mess up.  ",10,586
" Funnily enough we are still on the island and every other restaurant has gladly served our group of over 40 people, so I guess his threats of us needing to leave the island are laughably empty.  I think the owners character is demonstrable by his replies to any criticism on his trip advisor feed, so beware.",30,586

"I really like to give a realistic picture of a rental, not being overly critical, because you can always find fault.  However, painting an overly rosy picture doesn't help other travelers, so I would like to give the pros and cons: Pros: beautiful, large room.  well-decorated and you can tell the owners spent a lot to make these penthouses really nice.  Great food.  The tacos and guacamole were very good.   The drinks were knock-you-out strong.  One frequent island visitor described the bar as one where the day drinkers go.  Gorgeous shower and lots of storage, with a large,nice kitchen well-equipped. Each day we got fresh bottled water.  At the beginning of the stay, we got 3 granola bars, which were appreciated.  One of the best features of the room was the large windows that",50,586
" opened to almost the whole wall wide.  We had a great ocean breeze most days, and could see the water through the palm trees.The maid service was great, and the staff were friendly and attentive, especially Daniel.  Cons: when we arrived, I noticed a pretty strong, unpleasant odor.  Since the owner came up with us to show us around, I didn't say anything, as he had to also notice it. I thought perhaps it was temporary and would go away with the windows open.  It lingered for 4 days. I could smell it at night, even with the windows wide open.  I finally concluded perhaps it was gas? I am accustomed to the smell of gas in USA, but perhaps they add another additive to alert you? We messed with the stove knobs,and it finally abated.  I would think that the owner and or the maid would have noticed? Speaking of the owner, he was not as pleasant as his staff.  When we had an issue with the toilet (water pressure was BAD and the flushing wasn't efficient) my husband went down to tell him, and he was NOT happy.  He said accusingly, ""what did you do to it?"" and gave him a nasty look before coming up.  My husband was embarrassed, and we felt his attitude was bad.  We've never had that experience before.  Water pressure was a real issue on the 3rd floor, not sure of the other units. The water in the sink came out in a slight trickle.  I had to turn on the shower to wash my face!  The shower also had bad pressure,and I had a hard time washing my hair.   The last comment I will make was that it is pretty loud there, overlooking the bar.  Fortunately,the bar closes at 8, so you get a reprieve.  I felt like we had to be careful walking around the room while getting ready, as its not extremely private.   I would definitely stay elsewhere next time, as we will return to the island.  We loved our first visit to Isla Mujeres!!",50,586

The location is quiet but within walking distance of many restaurants, bars and beaches. The boho styled room was spacious with lots of storage space and the bed very comfortable.

Jazz prepared for us fresh fruits and pastries every morning with the best coffee we have had anywhere in Mexico. We had such a lovely stay at Casa Onali and will definitely be back.",50,587
"Casa Onali was wonderful. Tucked away in a quiet area if that's what you're looking for, but getting around the island was easy with a scooter.

I would highly recommend as everything went smoothly and our stay there was perfect. Thanks again!",50,587

He also gave us many suggestions, advice and recommendations on what to do, where to go, and where to eat while there. Enjoyed the fruit and coffee every morning.

"‘Perfect location’   Nothing. Seriously, nothing.   Casa Onali is a beautiful little building overlooking the lagoon and boardwalk. The suite was spacious, bright and airy, and very nicely decorated. The bedroom with en-suite was very comfortable with tons of storage and good a/c when you need it. The location was perfect-both the north and south points were only a 15 minute bike ride each way. The free use of a bicycle was a big bonus for me, as a solo traveller who likes to explore more than just the beach. I also felt very safe there and in the surrounding area. Jass is a wonderful and personable host, with a wealth of information and really good restaurant recommendations! It was a pleasure to chat with him about the island, and I always felt very looked after and",40,587
"I selfishly don't want to write this review so I can keep this place a secret. This was my first time on Isla Mujeres and it was without a doubt the loveliest vacation I've ever been on. Staying at La Vida Dulce with Steve and Jeri as casita hosts made it that much more incredible. I felt like I was at home. The people, the food, the conversations - time slowed down and I can't help but reminisce on the wonderful memories made over my stay, which I ended up extending an additional two days ;) When I come back, there's no doubt I will stay here again. To Steve & Jeri - I wish you love & happiness.  Until next time,  xoxo  Tay",50,588
"The owners live right there.  The front gate locks at night, you will have the key.  You can feel very secure.  The t v has English channels, so on a rainy day, all the creature comforts!   Everything is provided, linens, paper products,  coffee pot, microwave and small fridge. ",50,588
"LVD is centrally located - beach, restaurants/bars stones throw away!  The rooftop palapa provides a cool spot for game playing, cocktailing or outdoor dining. Jeri & Steve are great hosts, providing advice and insight on what to do/not do on Isla.  This trip we had two teen boys and unit #3 was perfect.  Adults and kids had their own space and the kitchen was great for dining in/snacking/etc.  We've stayed at LVD many times and they never disappoint!  Free ice, bottled water and US/CAN calls are icing on this delicious cake!",50,588
"We stay here every time we go to Isla. Steve and Jeri are great. The rooms are clean and well kept. They have beach chairs and some snorkel gear that you can borrow. The palapa is nice for sitting and reading. Everything you need for your stay. We've stayed in all of their rooms and had no complaints. This is in the downtown district and walking distance to stores, restaurants and the beach. Excellent location",50,588
I made appoint to eat at the best places in Cancun.  Its been a few years since I ate here but it still is the best Italian food and maybe the best overall restaurant in Cancun.  It is a small place with great service and great food at a good price.    We went as a family with my 2 teenage daughters and my 22 year daughter and her boyfriend.  It gave them a chance to wear their nice dresses and have a nice night out at a slightly upscale place.  You can still dress very casual but its not the surfin burrito. ,50,588
"November was our 3rd stay at La Vida Dulce. We have stayed in unit 1 & unit 2 Both have absolutely everything we need including a ton of room  Super clean ( they have a great lady who comes in as little or much as you want) & she does great job Owners Jeri & Steve are great! Have so much knowledge of the island , open , friendly accommodating  They were celebrating US thanksgiving when we were there & they invited us to a dinner they host every year up on the rooftop deck Just did a stop by and very impressed ton of food , lots of people local & otherwise Lastly location location location One street off main drag so not noisy yet can walk everywhere In fact we never even rented a cart last time  Just book our 5th trip to Isla and 4th at La Vida  Can’t wait  See you soon Jeri &",50,588

Great location near main business lane and playa norte. Hosts live onsite and were available for any questions but not overbearing. Air conditioning worked well. Kitchenettes had all we needed as we made our own breakfasts daily. We will definitely be returning there.,50,588
"My sisters/aunt and uncle all have stayed and loved this little casita.  Although I have visited many times I have never stayed. This two week visit I decided to stay in Suite 1 with my sister and bro in law in Suite 2. Loved it!!   Tastefully decorated, well equipped kitchen, comfy bed and a nice hot shower.   Suite 1 is next to the street.  Busy during the day but is very quiet at night.   The roof top palapa has a large table, outdoor seating area and dipping pool. This casita provides drinking water, beach chairs and towels and a library for beach reading.  Onsite owners provide extra security (not that you need it on Isla but nice for solo women travelers)  and they ensure you stay is comfortable. This place books up fast, as it should, so book early!",50,588
Stayed here and loved the location. Across the road from one beach and 5 minutes from Playa Norte.  2 blocks from Hidalgo.  Hot tub on the balcony in this unit.  Spacious and comfortable.  And it came with beach chairs and an umbrella! The only suggestion I would have is to not use scented products in the laundry.,40,589
"We recently stayed at Color de Verano for 2 1/2 weeks.  This has turned into being our go-to-place when staying on the island.  Teresa is such a great person to know.  She has a kind heart.  We stayed in Studio Apt. #1 for the first 3 nights prior to moving up to Apt. #2.  Color de Verano is in a great location while being close to Playa Centro and Playa Norte.  You have great views of Playa Centro if you have a balcony apartment.  The Studio Apts. are much larger than we anticipated.  In fact, I don't really consider them studios as they have a separate kitchen, bedroom, and bedroom.  The regular apartments have large balconies.  Please contact me if you have any questions.",50,589
"I stayed in the penthouse apartment for one month during late October and November 2020. The views from the penthouse are second to none. The apartment is very well designed and has everything you need for a long stay - including cooking the majority of your meals if you choose. There is also plenty of storage space for long term renters. Teresa, the owner, is an excellent host and very accessible. The daily staff is great and does a terrific job of cleaning. Wifi was good to support working remotely and streaming. Spending morning and evenings out on the deck were very memorable. I highly recommend. ",50,589
"This place was perfect for my boyfriend and I. Teresa is so kind and accommodating. We were welcomed by a bottle of wine and our room was very clean. The air conditioning was cold, the shower was hot, and we received fresh towels every day. We can’t wait to stay here again. ",50,589
"This is our eighth year staying with Teresa and we love it! This is truly our home for the holidays and we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. The apartment has the perfect space and amenities, the location is perfect, and Teresa takes such good care of us. We love our Isla home!",50,589
"Customers love this place (and for good reason), and return year after year, and make it hard for others to get a booking.   There are only five units; two studio units with kitchettes on the street level, two one bedroom apartments on floors 2 and 3, and a penthouse studio on the top floor.   The staff are exceptional; with cleaning staff six days a week doing the best cleaning job, and a concierge service six days a week who will assist you in anything from ordering pizza to booking tickets.   Services provided include coffee, bottles water, soaps and vegetable washer, beach chairs and umbrellas, and complete kitchen ware.   A bottle of wine is provided when you check in plus crackers and goat cheese.   Can you possibly ask for more!!",50,589
"We have stayed here previously and just love Color de Verano.  It is close to both Playa Centro and Playa Norte and a short walk to Hildago.  We stayed in Apt. 2.  It has a large balcony, kitchen with full-size refrigerator, living room with couch and chairs, bedroom, and bathroom.  There is ample room to store your clothes and essentials.  There are hangers in the closet in the bathroom along with a safe and a bin for laundry.  You really can't beat this place.  The only draw back for some people might be the number of stairs.  Teresa (the manager) is like family to us.  She is a very sweet lady.  Your apartment is cleaned every day, except on Sunday.  The bathroom has double sinks and a large showers with adequate water pressure.  I am sure we will be back there again.    Some",50,589
" people in their reviews commented about the noise.  You do hear cars going by early in the morning, but it is not bad.  We did hear some rowdy people in front of PA one night, but they were arrested and taken away!  I really do not feel noise was an issue.  Plus, I like to get up early and go hunting for sea glass!",50,589
…,50,589
"We stayed in Apartment #2 for nearly 3 weeks and can't wait to go back.  We have stayed at several places on the north end in the past.  Theresa met us when we arrived.  She had cool towels and a bottle of wine for us.  What a great host!  The kitchen is connected to the living room with a divider that includes stools.  The kitchen has a full-size refrigerator, small electric stove, coffee maker with good coffee, glasses, utensils, microwave, and a large container of water.  There was a bag of ice in the freezer to use.  The living room has a couch, 2 chairs, and table.  There is a sea / Caribbean motif throughout the apartment.  There is a special lighting on the wall above the couch.  I wish I could describe it better!  It has a great effect in the dark.    The large balcony",50,589
"We had the most amazing week at Casa Flamboyan! It is in the perfect location on Isla Mujeres - halfway between the northern downtown area and the more local southern neighborhood. You can easily walk to all of the restaurants and shops on the northern end, but we rented a golf cart for the week and it made getting around effortless. Plus, it was fun! The rooms are spacious and were so clean when we arrived, you could probably have eaten off the floor. The room setup with multiple outdoor porches and kitchenette is perfect for a very low-key vacation. The hosts (American) are warm, welcoming and helpful with any travel logistics, food recommendations and contacts on the island. We can't wait to go back!",50,590
"Our stay at Casa Flamboyan was from Nov 29 to Dec 13. We were fortunate enough to stay in both rental units over that time. Both units are immaculate and well laid out, everything we needed was there even snacks for late arrivals - salsa, frijoles, chips, some eggs, butter, coffee, and sugar. Bathroom products (soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion) are very nice quality as well. The wifi is good but may not be fast enough for some - I worked as well over this vacation and was only minorly frustrated over slow speeds but that's a system problem. Abundant room to hang out - front and back verandas as well as a sandy area by the sea. Warning - it is not safe to swim on this side of the island the current is very strong, the surf has been high since we've been here and it's pretty",50,590
" rocky as well. Nice pool and excellent rooftop area. Amenities are a short walk away to the south, there's a tienda about 10 min stroll and about the same distance to the south end of the malecon. Chedraui is a 20 minute walk away. Coco Jaguar about 15 min stroll  in Salina Chica. Sidewalks in not bad shape. Bus runs past the house at least hourly but times are difficult to predict, it's better to take the bus on the way back. We didn't find the traffic noisy - front door is almost soundproof.  Will definitely stay here again.",50,590
…,50,590
We always have an excellent time at Casa Flamboyan!  The rooms are always sparkling clean and kept up throughout the week. Lupi checked on us everyday to see if we needed anything.  Convenient location! Loved the watch the sunrise every morning and walk looking for sea glass!,50,590
"First, for those concerned about Covid: The apartment was extremely clean on arrival and stocked with lots of hand sanitizer, Clorox  wipes and sealed packaged masks.  Also there were basics for a breakfast if you arrived late and stores are closed: eggs, butter, beans, salsa, apple juice and a couple of beers.  Also salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, filters, 5 gal jug of purified water, small ice chest, beach chairs, nice smooth bed sheets(rare in Mexico), fluffy white freshly-bleached towels and wash-clothes, dish soap and small bottles of shampoo and conditioner and bar soap, toilet paper and paper towels.  Plenty of dishes, glasses and pots and pans, an electric orange juicer(love the fresh-squeezed orange juice here), a sharp chefs knife and cutting mats, drip coffee maker, etc.",50,590
"  There is a microwave, refrigerator/freezer, and 4 burner gas stove.   I normally buy a bag of ice but the store was out, so maybe ice trays would have been nice but with it being cool out, they weren’t a necessity.  So basically bring clothes and you are good to go.  Lupe, the house manager, met us on arrival and showed us around.  Her English is very good.  There is also an informational book in the apt. with house info and restaurant suggestions.  The king bed is very firm which is typical of Mexico but we had no problems sleeping. IM had a few cool days (high of 75) so we were plenty cool at night with the ceiling fans and the back door open with screens closed, being put to sleep by the waves. There is a good AC mini-split over the bed, if needed for warm nights.  The house is an easy, flat 10-15 min walk to downtown or over to the marina side to the Soggy Peso for very strong margaritas.  Or rent a golf cart or flag a taxi out front if you don’t want to walk-though we needed the exercise after all the food we consumed. . The decor was beautiful (see pics). The doors all had working locks and there was a safe so everything was very secure.  They even furnished heavy wooden bars that allow you to leave the doors and windows open a a little at night for a breeze and still feel safe, though I’ve been coming to IM for 15 years and have never felt unsafe anywhere on the island.  The back balcony is wonderful for a little morning sun while reading a good book(there are even plenty of those furnished of all genres).  The front palapa deck is great for a hammock snooze or to dine outdoors and watch the world go by. Occasionally the exhaust fumes were a little much if the traffic was heavy (mainly on Sunday when there was a lot of golf cart traffic from all the families coming over for a Sunday Funday from the mainland), but then we just moved to the back balcony. The golf cart/scooter traffic is unavoidable these days any place on the island and you couldn’t hear it from the bedroom which is in the back, so don’t let that deter you from staying at this beautiful home. The sound of the waves tend to cover other less pleasant noises anyways since the water is literally 40 ft from the back of the house. The waves are pretty big this time of year and the current is strong and the coral is sharp, so we didn’t swim here.   North beach or the bay side are much better for that. The pool was very clean and refreshing for a swim though. The tide pools amongst the coral rock beach were fun to watch sea life. There is a roof top deck with swings to watch sunrise or sunset and lounge chairs for getting a tan.   Lupe came by daily to see if we needed new towels or TP etc.but you can put up a do not disturb note if you want the ultimate privacy.  She cleaned everything on our third full day there and even asked what time was convenient for us the day before.  We were an easy golf cart ride to our favorite panaderia in the Colonias(P. Carmelita) to get empanadas camote(sweet potato). It was an extremely laid-back, relaxing trip in one of the nicest places we’ve stayed on IM. Great value for the price and felt much safer from a Covid perspective than a hotel or house in el centro but still close to the north end for beach and dining, though there are many more dining options all over the island now than when I started coming here in 2006.  We will definitely stay here on out next visit, if it’s available.    ",50,590

"We have been coming to Isla Mujeres for many years and always  try different accomodations to change up our experience. Casa Flamboyan did not disappoint! We chose ""Real"" which we found to be beautiful and spacious. The unit was very well stocked with everything we needed and the house keeper Lupe was most pleasant and accommodating. We enjoyed the views from the rooftop as well as the fabulous vistas from the ocean side terrance and front balcony.  We had the entire place to ourselves and certainly enjoyed the privacy :) We rented a golf cart for the week as we like the freedom it provides and we were very happy the unit included beach chairs that we were able to take with us. The North Beach has become row upon row of umbrellas and chairs jammed together and we were so happy",50,590
 to find a less crowded area each day where we could have our own shaddy space under a tree!  Casa Flamboyan was perfect for our needs and we are so happy we chose it!,40,590
"Our experience here at Casa Roca Caribe was exceptional. As soon as you walk in the door, the blue Caribbean Sea is right there in front of you. (See photo) Communication with the homeowners was great. My emails were answered promptly. If you book here, they will provide all of the information you will need to plan your trip.  The house is on a private dead end street, and is within steps to the local Catholic Church, a small corner grocery, and Mango Cafe. We felt very safe walking through the neighborhood. We were met by Lydia and Lorenzo upon arrival with complimentary cervezas. Lorenzo was very helpful with planning our stay. He arranged and picked up our golf cart for us, booked a snorkeling trip, gave us directions when needed, and even brought us fresh squeezed OJ every",50,591
" morning. We stayed on the Jacuzzi level with a private entrance. (All levels are private) The kitchen has everything you could ask for and more. The king bed in the master was very comfortable. The master also has a water view. Very clean throughout! The view here is just spectacular. You’ll have a hard time leaving the balcony!  Don’t hesitate to book this property! We felt like family staying here, and plan on coming back for years to come.",50,591

Casa Roca Caribe is a great place to stay and overlooks the ocean. It is beautiful and clean. Lorenzo and Lydia take great care of you!! It is close to good restaurants and can even get pizza delivery. You won't want to leave!,50,591
"Best stay on the Island. Karen and Jimbo go above and beyond to provide a beautiful and cozy getaway in the midst of the local community. Communication is superb and their website full of helpful info. There house staff is friendly and at your service. Our favorite drinks were waiting, fresh towels were brought before we even asked, bikes were a nice addition and Lorenzo brought us fresh squeezed Island Orange juice. Always fun and so private and quiet. Will return again next year. ",50,591
"Great value for the spot -- it couldn't have been better for my sister and me and our two teenage daughters. We had lots of privacy, and the view is absolutely perfect.  Lorenzo is a great host, and there were a few really good restaurants close by. ",50,591
"We have just returned from Isla and miss listening to the ocean. The Casa is exactly as pictured online. Authentic Mexican decor right at the waters edge. This unit  is in a neighborhood in the center of the island. I have stayed in the south end in the past and prefer this location. We rented a golf cart for 6 of our 10 days and found it easy to walk, use the Casa’s bikes or taxis on the days we did not have a cart. Restaurants and the main grocery store are an easy walk. The local staff were amazing and owners were excellent at providing information before and during our stay. Lorenzo the local property manager took us out snorkeling and made us a lobster dinner. Great vacation at Casa Roca Caribe.",50,591
"The view and the sound of the ocean was therapy. Went back home full of energy.The commodity of the house makes you feel like you are at home. The apartment is directly on the ocean with a big jacuzzi on the balcony. There are bicycles available for transportation (the island is small so you can go from one end to the other by bike). There is a major grocery store nearby if you feel like staying in and cooking in your fully equipped kitchen. Lots of restaurants nearby. If needed, help was just a phone call away. ",50,591
"We spent a week and a half in Isla and stayed at Karen and Jimbos for the majority of the time and it was a fantastic experience. What I loved most about this place was that it was away from the touristy areas. Nicely appointed, it was nestled on a cul-de-sac surrounded by locals and right on the rocky beach. We spent a lot of our time exploring the rocks and just relaxing. Would 100% recommend and do it again.",50,591
"This is our second stay at Casa Roca Caribe.  Hosts Karen and Jimbo are very friendly and responsive before, during and post trip.  The staff Lorenzo, Lidia and Jose are all very friendly and helpful.  Lorenzo set us up with a wonderful day trip to snorkle with whale sharks.  We had a great experience with Cerviche tours. Casa Roca Caribe is clean, comfortable and has everything you need (kitchen equipment, beach chairs, beach towels and bikes).  We rented a golf cart to get around.  The view and pool on the back of home are wonderful.  Love that it is on the quiet side of the island.  Several restaurants and bars are a short walk or ride away.  We loved breakfast at Mango Cafe and happy hours at the Topaz. Would highly recommend staying at Casa Roca Caribe.",50,591
"We have been to the island 7 times, and have stayed with Lolo all 7 times!  We love her unique rooms and style, and her breakfasts are beyond amazing!  The honeymoon suite opens to a private pool and oasis, perfect for relaxing in the afternoon. We enjoy staying mid island, and it is very close to Chedraui, Mango Cafe and several resturants. We will be back!!",50,592
"I came to Lolo with my Goddaughter Maya and her boyfriend.Lolo gave us half of a villa ( 2 large bedrooms) for the price of one. She created vacation of a lifetime for all 3 of us. Lolo is a wonderful person and she has adorable son and niece and a dog and cats. Lolo is a great Chef and she cooked for us often even though it was not in a contract. The best place on earth for a family vacation. If you don't have a family, they will become one.",50,592
"Lolo and her space are amazing & the breakfast she cooks are delicious.  I came to get away - solo female traveller - and Lolos was perfection.  I rented the Honeymoon Suite and could not have been more pleased; intimate, private, secluded, conveniently located (but, not in the middle of the tourist spots), healing - truly special.  Lolo is easy to talk to and her breakfast were beyond amazing - unique and personal - she asked what i liked and delivered!  Plenty of towels, comfy bed, beautiful pool, incredible design, special touches throughout. I will be back!  Thank you Lolo - forever grateful for the time spent at your little magical oasis and for our morning chats ",50,592
"Great place, quiet, very clean room, lovely sheets  and towels, loved  the owner... I can recommend this B&B without hesitation. It’s the nicest place I saw on the island.  Will definitely come back .....Nicky",50,592
"We have stayed with Lolo for the past 5 years. We found her on TA looking under B&B’s and found she also does 5 star dinners and were intrigued. We fell in love with her quaint little place mid island, and feel we get a much more local vibe than the big places downtown. We started out staying 5 days. Now 14 days is not enough!  Also, very peaceful and laid back which we like. We have stayed in the blue room and the honeymoon suite and LOVE the HMS with the sliding doors directly to the pool. And her 2 course breakfasts are the best on the island. We will be back. Of course!  Lolo’s Is our Isla home away from home.",50,592
"Best words to describe Lolo's place is a home away from home. My husband and I are so glad we decided to rent with Lolo. Her place is located about 5 mnts taxi ride to the North Beach. We rented a golf car and we explored the entire island and ate in a different place every day, but breakfast in the mornings were with Lolo! She delighted us with new things every morning. Lolo as well as her niece Hanna are gifted in the kitchen, they can cook! Lolo is well known and respect it in the island If you ask her she can give you recommendations on where to eat and go around the island. I can not recommend Lolo's place enough, come and stay in one of her beautiful, artistic rooms, you will not regret it.",50,592
We chose the tree house. ..my favorite since you have that small terrasse to drink your Coffee and watch the sun rise while everyone else is still asleep. ..wonderfull feeling i'm already missing so much... Great breakfast as allways !,50,592
"My partner and I stayed with Lolo for a week and felt like family by the end of our trip. We stayed in the blue room which was so cool, filled with details and a beautiful private bathroom with direct access to the stunning pool! Breakfast was service every morning, each dish was delicious and so creative. We always looked forward to what was coming next. The property itself is stunning, so many creative and intentional details around every corner. The staff was beyond accommodating. The neighborhood is a few minutes from downtown. I always felt safe and taken cared of. I could not have imagine it would be this lovely to stay with lolo! We plan to stay with lolo every time we visit the island!",50,592
"If you are fortunate enough to visit Isla Mujeres then make sure to include a dinner at Lolo’s during your stay. Lolo provides a set course dinner which never disappoints from carrot soup, grilled scallop, ginger crusted salmon, chocolate mousse...I could go on. At the communal table you will meet world travelers from jazz musicians to former marines to antique dealers, all interested in gourmet food and good conversation.  I am already planning my next visit after three so far!",50,592
"My husband and I just spent 2 weeks with Lolo Lorena as a kickoff to our retirement.  Lolo upgraded us to the Honeymoon Suite which was spacious, well-appointed and full of incredible design features. The bed has a wonderful memory foam mattress and the linens were high quality.  There are so many high quality bath towels. We could never use them all. There is Apple tv with Netflix and Prime  Video access.  The wifi is strong and always available. Living in the Colonia, instead of town, gave us a deeper appreciation for all that Isla has to offer. We were paying attention, yet we continued to discover the wonders of the room throughout our stay.  The daily breakfasts, included with the room, were surprising, creative and delicious.   Meeting the other guests and Lolo’s talented",50,592
"This is a tasteful decorated small hotel right on the beach. It is very well designed, so despite the hotel being on a small plot it maximise space. The pool starts almost as soon as you walk in and continues to the beach. Very clever. Stylish comfortable furniture and beds. Chic bar area. The best breakfast I’ve ever had, served to you, freshly prepared. Friendly helpful staff.  Good location, within a short walk to two sister hotels you can also use & dine in.  Two other small hotels and a beach bar within walking distance. There is also a cenote (sink hole) a short walk away.  It’s situated on a strip a couple of miles long, housing about 50 fabulous villas, so we took a long walk along the beach each  morning…. Dreaming of being rich!  The hotel is situated about, 15 mins",50,593

Such a beautiful hotel!  We stayed there for 3 nights and totally enjoyed our stay. The breakfast which is included was amazing and very fresh. We also had a fantastic dinner on one evening.  We stayed at a suite with our own private rooftop pool with a great view. The room was always clean and we felt very comfortable.  The beach area is very beautiful and calm. You can also rent a Kayak or Paddleboard for free and also bikes at the reception! :)  We’ve been very sad to leave this amazing place and hope we will come back again one day :),50,593
The rooms were amazing! Super clean and the hotel grounds were always so peaceful! It literally made you feel like you were living next to a beach and jungle with no distractions. The hotel is also in a  community that has a guard shack that doesn’t just allow anyone; and the grounds have a security guard. The staff was amazing! Isabel Martinez was in charge of the front desk and helped us with any of our needs. She literally made reservations at all the restaurants and clubs we wanted to go so that we never had issues getting in anywhere. She would also make sure we always had a ride into the town. She was super helpful! We can’t thank her enough for helping us so much! The food at the restaurant was great! It was five star quality with a view next to the ocean. When I come,50,593
 back to Tulum I will 100 percent be staying here again! I definitely recommend!,50,593

Food , drinks , staff were all first class  Rooms and pool area lovely , literally on the beach  It’s on a lively small strip with other hotels and amenities  Special mention for Isobel on the front of house , very helpful and charming and Abraham in the restaurant , bar area again so helpful and nothing was to much trouble  The best breakfast we have ever had !!",50,593
"Stayed here with our two young adult daughters for 7 days.  This is the antidote to all the  huge/hipster corporate mega-resorts taking over Quintana Roo. Hotel is tiny (14 rooms) but so incredibly authentic and charming. It's like going back in time 25 years. Staff --special shout-out to Eleonora--are all so kind, personable and thoughtful. Great on-site bar/restaurant (Mivida) serving at palapa looking over beach, and on beach itself.  Would come back in a heartbeat.",50,594
"We had a great experience at Punta Peidra! Friendly staff, great vibe. We stayed in room 21.  Fantastic room overlooking the beach with a large balcony. Very close to good restaurants. Good breakfast included and great Italian food served as well. I would definitely stay here again!",50,594
A great location with amazing access to your own little beach paradise. My upper level room had sizeable deck with an awesome view of the ocean while still tucked away in the palms for the perfect layer of protection from the sun. The pizza place right across the street was INCREDIBLE and so were the other shops & eateries. Tulum is a dream.,50,594
"I cannot speak more highly of this hotel. There was so many hotels to choose from and finally we just made the decision to come here and I am so happy we did. The views are insane, the food is amazing the staff is amazing. They made this trip absolutely 10 out of 10. You get to know the staff they greet you by your name it’s not just that you’re a hotel guest to them they actually care. The food is phenomenal we ate at all the hotels on the strip all the top rated ones and this food outweighed them by far.  Right across the street there’s a really good pizza place as well and a café called potheads. Right beside them is a scooter rental place it’s only $45 for 24 hours so you get to return it the very next day and that’s right next-door to this hotel. The owner Alex cares so",50,594
 much and sodas his whole entire staff. We will come back to Tulum to stay here that’s how amazing this hotel was. Get the ocean view king room. I wish we could’ve stayed longer. Thank you for everything,40,594

Compact hotel with a lot in tiny space. The best part is the access to a small beach shared with 3 or 4 resorts. Great to relax on the beach and watch the frigates and pelicans. An iguana visited us one evening on the beach. Should try the cocktails served by the very helpful and friendly Arsenio. ,50,594
"Love this place!  Amazing staff. Amazing location, great beach, and walking distance to MANY awesome restaurants/bars/beaches/CENOTES!!! (a not miss!!!)/local attractions.  Wish we were still there and want to never leave.  Will definitely be going back.",50,594
"Great location, it shares a beach with Azulik!  And a 7 eleven is in very very short walking distance.(like a block, but there aren't blocks there)  This place turned out to be a classic beach front place to stay.  It felt like a step back in time, but with modern creature comforts. Don't expect fancy furnishings, it's a very laid back place, but it's so quaint.  The whole place is filled with antiques, it's awesome. Everything was freshly painted with a distressed look in our room and we had a very large open/private balcony.  Our mattress was very comfortable and our room was immaculate.  There was a mini fridge and a safe in the room.  The safes are the ones you program with your own unique four digit code.   This is an older building so don't expect perfection.  The door to",20,594
" the bathroom didn't quite shut properly so if that's going to bother you don't stay in room A.  Can't say for the rest of the rooms, to us it wasn't a big deal.  There is a restaurant on property and they will serve you there, at the covered oceanfront terrace by the pool or on the beach itself, which was very nice.  The shrimp tacos were the best I have ever had and the breakfast offered every morning was very good.  They offer coffee, mango juice, toast and a choice of made to order omelets , scrambled eggs, rice and beans, or  pancakes and fresh fruit.   All of the staff was friendly and helpful, Ale our cleaning lady put extra touches to our towels, it was so sweet! (see pics)  We would definitely stay here again.  ",30,594
"Los Arrecifes was an absolutely gorgeous hotel right on the beach in Tulum. The staff (especially victor) was extremely helpful but there is only a few people so, if you’re looking for that all inclusive resort feel, this isn’t the place for you. But, if you want a place with a beach right in the front and amazing drinks, this is the one! The only downside were that the address was that the gps does not take you to the correct location and there’s no pool. Look for the wooden sign on the left of the road about 1/4-1/2 a mile before the gps tells you to stop. It’s a large closed wooden gate that they have to open for you. Overall a beautiful place to stay. Tulum was decently pricey down by the beach, but if you go to tulum central (for a decent cab fare of $20-$30) then you can",50,595
 get much cheaper prices for food and drinks. Very gorgeous place though. No car necessary because you will just take taxis everywhere.,30,595

"The place is super well located, really cute and clean. They have an amazing private beach, super nice workers , helpful and friendly and also good food. Too bad that the bar next to it has not only disturbing loud!! Music, but really bad taste :(",50,595
"We were meant to stay at Los Arrecifes for 4 nights but unfortunately we had to check out the morning after checking in because it was impossible to sleep. The hotel itself is really nice and the staff were absolutely wonderful, but unfortunately the hotel is located right next to some clubs which were playing loud music with bass all day and all night - until 3am! It was so much that ear plugs didn’t help at all, the walls were literally shaking from the bass. The room itself was spacious and luxurious with a great sea view, the location of the hotel on the beach is great - it has a nice beach area and the vibe of the hotel is so nice. Our room was ready to check into early, the lovely staff offered us a free drink each on arrival and everything was amazing until we got back to",10,595
" our room at midnight and then couldn’t sleep until 3am when the loud music finally stopped. It is such a shame that what could be such a lovely boutique hotel has been completely ruined by the super noisy clubs next door. When we complained to the staff they were so polite and understanding and allowed us to check out and refund us for the remaining nights and it was such a shame to leave, but unfortunately we simply could not stay somewhere so so loud. So if you are planning on coming to Tulum to party every night until 3am then this hotel is perfect for you - but if you plan to sleep before 3am some nights and want to get a good nights sleep then avoid (at least until the clubs next door are slapped with some restrictions on super late night music or the hotel improves soundproofing in the rooms).",40,595

"Los Arrecifes was are second stay in October 2021 , the first time in Tulum was March we wanted to be in the zona Helotera this time to experience the bars and restaurants vibes .  Marta and staff made sure our stay was fantastic , clean room every day , amazing food and drinks and the best view we could ask for .  Music t night was loud until 1am but we didn’t mind at all because we stayed up late and slept in very well . Loved everything about it .",50,595
"This hotel is basically a scam and it’s unlivable.. the rooms might be ok (nothing special), but this hotel is so close to the nightclub called Taboo that the walls of the rooms are literally shaking. I know that Tulum is hardly a quiet place these days, but living in that hotel would be equal to sleeping at a techno concert under the stage. Literally unlivable",50,595
"The good:  This is just what you‘d expect of Tulum: An insanely beautiful stretch of sand. Perfect views from every room. Very boutique and private feel. Tasteful decoration. Sophisticated yet casual eateries close by. Convenient parking in the backyard. Although prices in Tulum are very steep by international standards and you usually get less quality than expected, this place was worth every penny.  The bad:  As of January 2021 there are two large beach clubs right next to the property (Taboo and Tantra). Expect very loud, pumping EDM music from about 14.00–01.00 every day. It‘s worse on Saturdays. While walls are thick, the wooden doors let all the sound in and most of the time you feel as if you were inside the club. Even wax earplugs were useless in blocking out the noise.",50,595
"The hotel is really nice. Design and atmosphere make it a good place to spend some days. Nice swimming pools and good breakfast. Some minor issues to be fixed, but I would recommend it! Internet worked super fast only the first two days, but I think they had a general problem on the area",40,596
"Really nice little boutique hotel with modern decor and everything you need for a nice holiday.   The staff was very friendly and allowed us a late check out.  The breakfast was good, with yoghurt and muesli and bread and butter/marmalade. Coffee was better than in most places we have stayed.",50,596
"Good experience overall ,good size od the room and bathroom. 2 outside pools well maintained. More breakfast options would be beneficial, I would expect a better choice than granola and bread for the price we have paid.",40,596
"This place is the best! Friendly and extremely nice staff, beautiful spaces, and really close to the Main Street which is so fun. Only 30 minute bike ride to the beach. Staff helped with anything that was needed such as renting a scooter or directions. Breakfast was so tasty and more than expected. There was no construction like other posts mentioned either. The place is very clean and the rooms are so cute. Will be coming back and recommending to friends!",50,596
"I would not recommend that hotel. The room was very humid and smells really bad. They were making noise all day long as they are changing staff in the hotel… They should do it without guest inside. One day we couldn’t sleep because of the noice as they were working till 22.00 and also a one member of the staff was listening to music very loud. When we told him to stop the music at 1.00 he said that he is in his room… I mean. Really?   The only good thing is swimming pool.  They also said on the website that there is parking, but you have to park your car on the street.   Breakfast is very simple. Everyday the same.",10,596
"My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 days in October in the King room with the tub. While the stay itself was pleasant, we were massively over-charged when we arrived. We had booked the hotel online through their website to avoid Airbnb, but when it came to check out through the website, the price we were charged was over $300 more than the price we had been shown on the website. When we raised this issue with the General Manager of the hotel, she agreed that there had been a mistake through the online booking service and ensured us that we would be payed back. After months of trying to arrange payment and the new General Manager Jesus acknowledging that our reimbursement “was a fact” - we have still not been reimbursed. At this point, we are doubtful that they ever intended to",10,596
" reimburse us, and feel entirely scammed. Both the hotel and the management did not help us …! Also the hotel was under major renovations which were loud and not very visually appealing. Nothing was offered to us, and we were not made aware of them prior to arrival. We are extremely disappointed with our experience and will never recommend to anyone.",10,596

"No wifi! The hotel is still under refurbishment and does not look clean! There were flies all around the open buffett breakfast. Disappointing, not recommending! It looks like a construction area and the money you pay for that place is too much for this quality hotel.",20,596
This hotel is a building site with noise from 7.30am and dust everywhere. We left after the first night as it is also in the middle of nowhere. And if you can't sit and chill by the pool because of the building site what's there to do.  Also very dodgy locks at the gate of property. Friend could get inside for about 20 minutes and there is nobody there at night to help open the door. Taxi to the beach is 600 mex pesos at night so very expensive to go out to the restaurants and beach. Very disappointed.  Hotel didn't give us a refund for our early departure and they were very unfriendly and dismissed the request. I'm sure once it's fully built it's nice but definitely far from being a relaxing place for a holiday right now.,30,596
"We were so fortunate to find this Venue and Hotel for our daughter's wedding. Everything was perfect. We had 85 family and friends attend the destination wedding. Renting out the entire hotel was fantastic. Everyone loved their accommodations and the pools, restaurant and bar were great additions. The entire staff was helpful. We had children in our group and there were never any safety issues. In fact we all felt safe and cared for. The wedding ceremony and reception was everything we dreamed. Guests have told us this was the best wedding they have ever attended. We also had an After Party on Sunday and that went extremely well. I wish I could give them more stars.",50,598
"We just returned home after staying at Coco Hacienda and another place in the hotel zone. Without a doubt, I’d much rather stay at Coco Hacienda because of its lovely pools, garden, fabulous food and service. The hotel zone is a cacophony of disco, engines revving and people trying to extract money from you.  If you’re looking to stay in Tulum and want to relax, here’s your place!",50,598
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I found it last year and decided to try it due to how inexpensive it was to stay here... did not disappoint not one bit. We drove to Tulum so when you're looking for this place it's like uhhh maybe I should've stayed at a resort, but once inside its this beautiful oasis that helps you escape the noise of the world. The staff were incredible and made communication so convenient (via what'sapp), the location is great for walking to a few shops and restaurants, tulum jungle gym is practically next door, and the food served is tasty.... Overall, coco has made me love tulum so much I find myself here more often than I care to admit lol. This is the best place to stay",50,598
"We had the most wonderful four days in Coco Hacienda. The room was perfect, the jacuzzi was perfect, the swimming pools were wonderful, the ambience was relaxed and chilled. Breakfast was delicious. Staff like Cristopher and the man working the desk during the day between the 13th and 18th April (can't remember his name - I'm sorry!!)  were so so helpful and kind and really wanted us to have the best experience possible. When we had tours booked that meant we missed our breakfast they went out of their way to prepare us a delicious packed lunch to bring with us. We had to cut our stay slightly short and staff could not have been more helpful. It was the best hotel experience we ever had and hope one day to return. My brother is going to Tulum in July with some friends and had",50,598

Thank you!!,50,598

"I highly recommend staying at Coco Hacienda Tulum. Our group booked 4 rooms, and two rooms were upgraded at no cost because better rooms were available. I think this speaks to their approach - provide the best experience possible. Other highlights: -Great air conditioning in rooms -2 lovely pools -Tasty breakfast at the restaurant  -Can arrange for spa treatments in the room  -Very quiet at night  The only issue was that the Wi-Fi was hit or miss in our room, but I got a good signal if I walked a few steps out of our door.",50,598
"It was an amazing stay at the Coco Hacienda. We also got an room upgrade and enjoyed the 4 nights at the hotel really much.  The staff is smiling the whole day. Supportive and really friendly. Breakfast at the poolside.  Cocktails are delicious and the Tacos are amazing.  Thank you so much, for making our days so wonderful",50,598
"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it did not disappoint! It was so hard to leave our beautiful room at the end of our stay. We were blown away when we walked up to our room. They had set out some flowers as they knew it was our honeymoon as well. We had an amazing balcony that was beautiful and so peaceful. The trees and garden around the hotel were beautiful. We constantly admired all the birds flying around the hotel. So peaceful! An ideal place to stay in Tulum! Cristopher and his staff were so friendly and INCREDIBLY helpful. From teaching us how to ride a scooter to helping us plan which cenote to go to, we were so grateful for their help. They really helped to make our stay perfect and we are forever grateful. The hotel is in the downtown area of Tulum",50,598
 next to some restaurants and shops. So much good food in Tulum! I’m very happy we did not stay at the beach as it was way more crowded and hectic. We were still only a short drive from the beach but this hotel was significantly more laid back. We were pretty close to a few cenotes and the lagoon and were able to take a scooter to both. We can’t stop talking about how amazing our experience at this hotel was. Thank you! We cannot wait to come back!,50,598
"We're frequent visitors of My Way Tulum, the original name and owner of the hotel. This year was the first time we visited Orchid Beach House and our experience was still great. We loved My Way for its quiet and laid back vibes in the midst of an ever-growing Tulum. Although they changed administration, the staff was friendly as always and extremely helpful. We especially adored Mariela, who went out of her way to make our stay very comfortable and nice. We hope you'll retain all of the good vibes My Way brought to the place and we'll return for sure!",50,599
"Amazing Hotel and all the staff are extremely helpful!! ** Liz, one of the staff members at the hotel is simply amazing - so helpful with our needs! beautiful personality!  With all the craziness that occurs in Mexico - recently, in Tulum - we felt extremely safe, as they had security all around the area at all times of the day.  ",50,599
I had the most amazing time at Orchid Beach House Tulum. What a beautiful and relaxing place to go to while staying in Tulum. The staff was awesome and also the food and drinks where amazing. Liz made our day; she was always there when we needed something and she such a sweetheart. I can't wait to go back to Orchid Beach House to relax and see Liz,50,599
"Orchid Beach House made itself a new go-to beach club for us over Easter week.  Small and chill scene, great sun and shade spots, delish food (ceviche) and drink (a real-deal Mojito) and best of all the service: Primo is a master, with his beach partner Lis, his nephew Demitrio, and manager Edvang.",50,599
"The place is alright.. nothing major or special about it. Definitely super expensive for what you're getting, but it didn't matter - my friends and I were in Tulum after 2 years of not having traveled, and we wanted to splurge. Upon arrival, no one came to help with the luggage.. let that pass, not a big deal. Over and above the high price we had to pay for a basic stay, they charged us deposits which they said is only a HOLD and won't be charged. On checkout, they confirmed the hold has been released. It was not a HOLD, the amount was authorized and charged - and here we are, 3 months later - still having to deal with this because they are not responsive and when they respond they say it's not their problem, because their bank released the money. Even though I've shown them",10,599
" actual statements showing the date those amounts got posted for me and my friends, they lie to our faces. If it's a small amount, I wouldn't be posting this - but among the 3 of us, it's close to a $1,000. There were a few other people that week too who got charged, so I wonder when they'll realize they've been hustled. We can't even dispute the charge because our physical cards were present, even though when the amounts were actually authorized, we were back in Canada. Do NOT stay here. Since management changed, I'm assuming things went down south for this place. I saw other reviews talking about this issue as well - glad to see they don't care about their guests or the reviews.",50,599

The staff Primo,Diego and Liz were absolutely wonderful and management kindly catered to all of our needs. We will definitely be back next year!",10,599
"Only there for the amazing food. We lived in a hotel next to it, went here almost everyday. Best lunch place along the beach. Great tacos, amazing burritos, cheap prices, and friendly and fun staff. The vibe was great, simple as that. Compared to other places along the beach, the quality-price ratio was a steal. It took time to get the food, but hey, that’s okey, when one is on vacation and the food is that good, it’s worth the wait.",10,599
"Wakax Hacienda reminds me of a fantastic theatrical production. When its live for the cameras. Its all glowing with whimsical lighting. However behind the scenes. Once the lights go out. This place drifts into slumber. If you want any attention. You can contact a (non-face to face) of a WhatsApp message to Itzel. Who seems to be the only one holding the fort together.  Or when filming certain areas. Guests are offered (dollars included).  To get off site to a 3 star Poc beach club at Zona Hotelera. Where there's sargassum piled high and the smell is awful. Luckily I was checking out that day.  Lets talk about this place. Without a doubt its absolutely beautiful. The grounds, cenote and lagoon is stunning. It does take your breath away.  The rooms are lovely and clean. What lets",30,600
" this place down is the indifferent service.  On checking in. Its all very efficient. You have to sign a disclaimer, presumably in case you might drown in the lake. It's not going to be their fault if you can't swim. So make sure you have good insurance. Once the official paper work was out of the way. I was carted off to my room. Suitcase just dumped behind the bed area. I wasn't offered a welcome drink. Or shown around the room.  Hardly the warmest of greetings.  The veranda has dirty cushions. I know this is the jungle. And there is lots of birds. Be nice though if they were cleaned.  So I thought I didn't want to spoil my stay. I carried on. Had a shower. Went for dinner at the only restaurant - called El Cocal. The waiter took my order. Food was very nice. Although I was left to eat in the dark. I didn't know there wasn't any lighting in the area. I arrived when it was still light. All the other tables were occupied. So I couldn't move. A bit more thought on the design needed in this area. When I finished. Plates taken away. I waited ages for the bill. No-one came again to see if I needed another drink. Or if I enjoyed my meal. So got up to get the bill at the bar. Signed it and walked away. No one said have a nice evening.   The next day. I had a positive approach to enjoy the lovely sunny day. Went for breakfast. Which was included in my room rate. I asked for the menu. As this is what we do in a restaurant. Only to be told, by a unenthusiastic waiter. What was included in my rate. I didn't get the menu. There was very little choice. The food was nice though. When I finished. I did get the check at the table. Signed it. Waiter never asked if I enjoyed my breakfast or said have a nice day. Clearly lacking in customer relations here.  It didn't improve at the following breakfasts. Twice I had cold coffee. Once my tortillas were forgotten. I eventually asked for hot coffee. Which I did get. I should think so too. Another dinner. The waiter didn't know what the daily fish catch was. Disappeared and never returned. 30 mins later. I asked another waiter. Who did know. Thank God for that.   Despite the poor service. I was going to leave a tip before I left. Then changed my mind when the staff were too busy talking to each other at the bar. All it took is to walk a few yards in an empty restaurant. To ask if I enjoyed my stay. . Surely you would acknowledge someone who eats at your restaurant for 4 days running. They did know. As one of them mentioned I was leaving, when they took the order.   It is possible to be friendly without being intrusive, We all like our own quality time and privacy. This place though seems out of balance. I did see one of the managers walk into the restaurant one day. She had a back to me. Why not just turn around and smile and say hello. Attentive management goes a long way.  I enjoyed the peace and quiet at Wakax. I didn't feel like a valued guest.   On departure. It was still very official. Here's your bill, exit pass and goodbye.  Not did you enjoy your stay. Doesn't this place want repeated guests?. Or is this place  just there to look incredible for the next big event or film?.  The above is based on my experience. Others may have their own opinion.",50,600

"We came here on our honeymoon, and this is far and away the best place I have ever stayed in my life. We even extended our stay an extra night because it was so perfect. From the pictures we could tell it was stunning and beautifully designed, but it was even more incredible in real life. The room was gorgeous, luxuriously comfortable and smelled amazing, with of course the classic useful amenities too like coffee facilities and a fridge in the room. Wandering around the site was like an adventure! The jungle setting is amazing. Around every corner you can find a private cenote, or a hidden nook with Persian rugs and cushions for chilling, or swimming pools. That brings me to the activities. There is so much to do here, and it's free! The brilliant activities leader, Gonzo, took",50,600
" us on a tour of the underground cenotes and on a bike tour around the site and its Maya village. He talked us through the geography and flora and fauna of the area with such interest and warmth, we learned a lot and loved his company! Beyond the tours- there are free yoga classes every morning and you can paddle board or kayak whenever you want. The cenote is open until 8pm so there's chance to do some night swimming too after dark, and it's beautifully lit! Finally the food. Oh my god, it's amazing. We tried as much as we could on the menu and everything was delicious. There’s also a whole separate menu for veggie / vegan options. The staff are friendly and attentive and take good care of you. We particularly enjoyed the ceviche, tacos, steak and the apple tart dessert! We can't wait to stay here again sometime, and will be recommending this place to everyone we know!",50,600

"We stayed at Una Vida for 5 nights during our 3 week honeymoon and I honestly think that it was the best hotel that we stayed at on our trip. The place itself is stunning, the rooms are decorated in a gorgeous way, as is the rest of the hotel. It has a great sized pool and a cute restaurant on site and you also have access to the sister hotel, Bardo, so you can use their restaurant and pool too which is great.  The staff are next level. They go above and beyond for you and make you feel so very welcome. Aristides on the front desk is brilliant, he gave us some great recommendations for local activities and no ask was too much for him. Paola in the restaurant was incredible! We looked forward to seeing her each morning at breakfast, she remembered our order and was always so",50,601

Travelled with our 6 month old, and they are so kind setting up shade areas, making her smoothies and suggesting baby friendly places.  Hotel is stunning… Beautiful rooms, with great showers. Pool area is so relaxing and chilled. Great food and drinks menu.  Aristides who works there is brilliant. Always on hand to help and offer his local advice.",50,601
"There are so many reasons to love Una Vida. The highlight for us was definitely the impeccable service we had particularly from Aris and Paola… they are literally the nicest, kindest people you’ll ever meet. So hospitable and made us feel at home. The heated pool was so lovely and our one year old daughter absolutely loved it. The hotel is beautifully decorated and so peaceful.. def no parties or loud music.. really makes it an oasis in crazy tulum. With a one year old it meant in the evening we were restricted to our room as she slept so it was amazing to be able to order room service from their restaurant and sister hotel Bardo.. the best room service we’ve ever had. It was also nice to have our own space while our baby slept in the room. The only downside I’d say was that",40,601
" weirdly the lounge to our one room suite was separate from the bedroom (it was as if they were two separate hotel rooms, separated by a hallway with two doors and separate keys).. maybe not an issue for some people but as we were with our baby we couldn’t relax being in a separate room .. if I would have known this I probably wouldn’t have booked this room. The only other thing I would point out is that the hotel is quite out of the way.. not really close to the centre nor to the beach (that also has its good points as it means it’s quiet and relaxing). Google maps says it is 20 mins cycle to the beach (it’s def not it’s more like 50mins to 1 hour unless you’re cycling 40mph). And the taxi cartel or Tulum charge ridiculously stupid prices so it’s $60 each way to the beach area where all the restaurants each way. There aren’t really any restaurants close by so if you’re happy just chilling at the hotel and not moving very much (as we were with our baby) then you’ll love it.. but if you want to be able to eat out and be a little closer to the beach, this might not be the place for you.",50,601

Great place with a great location. Right on the road to the beach and yet very close to the city centre. Staff are very very helpful polite and professional. Rooms are big and clean! We stayed 2 nights and decided to extend for another night.   The restaurant on premises has excellent food. We've ordered ceviche everywhere we went on our 3 week trip in Mexico and this was top 3! Good value for money too. Our server Carlos at the restaurant was amazing. Very good energy and super attentive.   We highly rate this place ,50,602
"Super sad about this experience, we choose this hotel accordong to the reviews but during our stay we totally don’t get why people recommend this hotel. The staff probably doesn’t know what hospitality means. Our room was dirty when we arrived, the pool is full of leaves all the time, the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows - it feels like they are full of clothes, like jeans or jackets - not any of pillow material :) :) :) The first night there was a party near the hotel and the music was extremely loud, so we couldn’t sleep, next morning at the front desk they said “what music? There is no music, we didn’t hear it”. We left tips for the houskeeper for celaning, but when we got back to the hotel - the tips were taken, and the trash bin was left full, the sink was dirty",10,602
" and our wet towells were taken from the floor and put back on the shelf :) :) i know it, because I used it before I left, it was wet in the same place and taken from the floor (front desk told us to leave them on the floor if we want to get our towells changed) :) day after - we left our hotel at 8:30, get back - 3:30 no evidence that houskeeping was in our room. Ow, and I didn’t hear “sorry for that” once, front desk manager seems polite but doesn’t help with anything. If you want a pool towel you can only get one a day, and some of them are ripped and discoloured :) So this hotel is totally not worth the price or the reviews that it has. I stayed in Tulum for the same price in another hotel and got amazing experience. So be aware before spending your money ! :)",20,602

Room incredibly uncomfortable - bed is hard, pillows feel like a couple sacks stuffed with any bits of cloth they can find. Hot tub isn’t a hot tub, water is luke warm and takes hours to fill… and when it does work there’s a very strange, unclean smell.  When we mentioned we were disappointed at check out the hotel didn’t care, receptionist shrugged her shoulders. There are much better places. Stay elsewhere, thankfully it was only a couple nights!!!",10,602
"Nice place to stay, affordable prices, staff is very helpful and polite. There’s a swimming pool and restaurant on site. Room as described and clean. Has a mini fridge. Soap and shampoo (no conditioner on the amenities). Reliable Wi-Fi. Comfy bed. No surprises. Walking distance 10-20min from lots of restaurants and commercial areas.  Need a car or scooter to go to the beach/ ruins/ cenotes. They can help with tours on site.",10,602
"Definitely does not worth that price! The room smells awfully bad! We let the staff know about it, and they could not do anything effective because it was coming from the shower tubes (the room was cleaned again and the smell came back a few hours after).  On top of that we were deprived from water the 1rst day from our arrival 6pm to the next morning 9am! Impossible to use toilets or shower (after a 20hour flight and a swin in the sea it was such an issue!) We wanted to talk to the manager as the staff could not do anything on their own. The manager was always absent during our 3-day stay. We could not be reimbursed to change hotel as we would have liked to. Moreover no commercial gesture was done! definitely not recommended, for that price you will find a much much better",50,602
 option! Ps: the only positive thing is a the Argentinian girl at reception who was kind.,40,602

"I come to Tulum often and because this hotel had a friendly guest policy I decided to give it a try; BIG MISTAKE!  Summary of what was wrong during my stay:  •	The picture advertised on Travelocity showed my room with a desk and chair, when I arrived there was no desk and chair   •	They didn’t have washcloths for your face or body  •	The AC in my unit was horrible, it barely made the room cold •	On one day the power to the entire hotel was out for a few hours!!!!!!! •	The biggest deal breaker for me was the lack of wifi. I came here expecting that I would have a reliable internet connection so that I could work from the hotel •	 I stayed here for two days and the Wi-Fi was extremely spotty or just didn’t work at all. On the third day of my seven day reservation I left. •	They",50,602

"Reserved a dinner in the nests, got here and was told all kinds of minimums per person. Two types of nests one had minimum of $150 pp, other has $100 pp. For beach there’s $60, $80, or $100 minimums for different types of tables. Good experience!",40,603
"I went to Kanan with some friends for Reset Sunday with DJ Shai T and had the most amazing evening. The music, ambience and general concept were all on point and the whole place is visually incredible.   Special thanks to Anuar for his recommendation and for helping us have such a great time. We will definitely be coming back and recommending Kanan to all our friends.",50,603
Beautiful experience with different seating options.   The service was efficient and friendly.   Our server Roger did a great job of making our experience memorable!   Would definitely recommend if you are interested :),50,603
"Beautiful structure, literally living in a jungle for a week.  Their Spa worth a try ,  Kanan  has the most kind and attentive staff that you wish or your holiday!  We had an issue which has been deal professionally .. Special thank you to Natalia .",50,603
"The hotel is a “work of art”.  Just awesome, as the crew.  They are all great. Place very well located, can walk all Tulum hot spots.  Perfect place to rest, or if you prefer, have fun.   The restaurants are very good and the shows at the nest are unmissable.",50,603
I came to the Kanan Hotel’s Restaurant to celebrate my graduation and it was a phenomenal experience. I was traveling alone but Roger and the rest of the staff made me feel so welcomed. The servers were extremely kind and attentive; they even took some photos for me and brought out sparklers and a house cocktail for my birthday. It’s rare to find such a unique experience and truly caring group of people when traveling to popular locations abroad. I will definitely be back and I recommend that everybody come visit for the nest dinner under the stars experience. There were even rose petals and candles; I felt super special.,50,603
"Our stay was fantastic. The property is absolutely stunning and it feels like being in a giant tree house. The view on the ocean is fantastic, beach access, and the rooms are beautifully decorated. Ours had a super nice bathtub. The location is great as you are in a lively part of Tulum beach. There is a lot of music which we enjoyed and we also slept well regardless, but if you are looking for a peaceful stay, maybe it’s not the right hotel for you. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We got a massage in the spa and it was extremely good. You also get free access to the famous Tulum jungle gym. The restaurant is pricey but the view is beautiful. I would come back to this hotel anytime.",50,603
The room was absolutely incredible. The staff was top notch and could not have been nicer. One of the cleanest hotels you can stay at in Tulum.  My girlfriend and I moved hotels because we wanted to try 2 hotels and all we wanted to do was get back to Kanan. 10/10,50,603
"Best hotel by far in Tulum. Location was perfect, service was impeccable, scenery was amazing. We had the best time.  We felt safe in this hotel, and we felt our belongings were safe.  They had security watching us always and I loved that.   Thank you Marcos, Carlos, Javi, Nestor, Robert, Pedro and all others - you made an impression on us  all of the ladies who worked the front desk and guest services were so sweet and accommodating as well.  If we ever come back to Tulum we will be staying at kanan hotel! We had the most romantic time!  The people that work here are honest, genuine and fun! Best staff Eva!",50,603
"Lovely stay at Suenos Tulem, located right on the beach with a beautiful pool. The grounds are exceptionally well landscaped, with fascinating lizards all around. Recommended for a stay with small children, you can have yummy breakfast, lunch and dinner with your toes in the sand and drinks/food all very reasonably priced compared to other establishments nearby. All staff are very friendly and helpful.",50,604
"We enjoyed a relaxing, low-key week on this beach where it is increasingly difficult to find that quiet, relaxed vibe that made Tulum popular in the first place.  The hotel is family run, and that shows in the genuine, friendly attitude of all who work here to do their best to make sure you enjoy your stay. The rooms and beds are charming (if I wanted beige I'd go to New York) and comfortable.  The tropical garden is livingly tended. The expansive beach is sublime.  You never feel crowded by other guests.    The big added bonus here is the kitchen.  The food was exactly what we wanted - simple, clean and healthy well prepared local food.  Do yourself a favor and order a whole fish at least once during your stay.  Yes, you have to plan ahead and tell them the day before, but it",50,604
" is  fresh from the fisherman in the morning and prepared to order just for you.  We did this three or four times.  Another meal we had the  best enchiladas we have ever had, followed another day by the best chicken mole followed by sublime stuffed chiles.  We loved that the meals, served in the garden, were  just for hotel guests.  Dinner was relaxed and chill and we never felt we were on someone else's vacation.  We were somewhat concerned about the fact that this is a ""family"" resort, but we found for the most part that during our visit the children here were traveling with engaged, responsible parents.  They simply were not an issue.    In a resort town that is increasingly defined by thumping house music, bad sushi and spring break-like partying, Suenos was a welcome retreat.",50,604

"It looks and feels  like a tropical paradise at the resort. You can literally walk around the resort barefoot (buckets of water were provided by the room doors to dip your feet in, to not track sand in the room). The Mayan decor throughout the resort, and in the room was a nice touch. There was even a hammock in the room. The bed in the room was extremely comfortable, the room was really clean, & cleaned daily. There was no need to leave the resort with soothing music playing,  the beach literally a few feet away, with hammocks & plenty of places to lay out on at the beach that was not crowded. They even had someone at the beach to ensure that other non-guest would not sit in the beach chairs.   Sebastian and the entire staff provided the best customer service, and they were all",50,604
" very accommodating. I also appreciated the sunblock & mosquito sprays that were available in the open lobby for guest to use. The continental breakfast was really good, filling, and extremely fresh. It included freshly squeezed juice, yogurt with fresh fruit & granola that was made at the premises. Breakfast also included scrambled eggs, & croissants/breads.  I mostly ate the chicken tacos which were good as well. I really enjoyed the fresh hot salsa that they provided with all my meals (I requested it & they always remembered to include it which I really appreciate it). They also made the best pina colada drinks.   Sensation also provided great recommendations on a very good restaurant, & activities to do during our stay that were all very good options.    I also took a yoga class that was offered there. Although, it was not on the beach but in a designated area on the premises, the waves from the beach could still be heard. It was a very peaceful experience.   I highly recommend staying here, I definitely did not want to leave the relaxed paradise life I had there.",50,604

"My friends and I stayed at Suenos for 5 days and it was simply paradise on earth. I cannot recommend this hotel enough - the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and well taken care of. Our room was clean, comfortable and cool (despite no air conditioning at night!). The complimentary breakfast is healthy and a delicious start to each day. The beach is clean, private, quiet and relaxing, and a short walk to the busier beach clubs. The ocean is simply divine and any seaweed is meticulously cleared by staff which is so appreciated! There are also gorgeous sunrises every morning to enjoy in the cabanas. The service was excellent - special shout out to Cecelio who made the tastiest drinks and remembered our preferences! We especially loved enjoying a drink by the",50,604

"My wife and I made our first trip to Mexico and had a truly memorable trip. The entire staff was so welcoming and made us feel at home. They really went above and beyond to make our stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible and they succeeded. The service, food, drink, pool and rooms were all first-rate. Elizabeth, Ivan, Ana and others are extremely nice and had several great suggestions for activities off the resort and great dinner recommendations. The hotel setting is extremely unique and is a true oasis in paradise. We are already planning our next trip back to Radhoo Tulum for later this year.  Muchas gracias, Sam and Ada",50,605
"We had an amazing vacation Thank you for the warm welcome from Ivan, Elizabeth,  Anna, &  Abdiel. We received superb service from Efrain, Alejandro, and  Ricardo.

We look forward in returning in non salgaso season to enjoy the beach. Thank you to all & sad to go home.",50,605
"Came back from there yesterday! Here are my thoughts   Pros: -beautiful hotel location is remote a bit but it’s perfect if you are looking for a place to relax  - amazing concierges, you feel like that you are treated Individually you can always ask anything recommandation or help they are all super nice and their services are great  -great pool - really good food without leaving the hotel   Cons: - isolation of the room you can hear everything  I mean everything from your neighbors  (even sneezing)we were at the bottom room so their were neighbors above us the first night they woke us up at 5:00am so if you are sensitive to the noise it might be a big issue - we encountered problem with our AC the first 3 days and the last day  the remote wasn’t working even after having the",40,605

"Thanks to all the staff at Radhoo for being so attentive and making our week in Tulum stress free. The concierge team and all the staff have been amazing. With a special mention to Alessandro who’s cheeky smile at breakfast has got our days off on the right foot. The space itself has been perfect and has everything we expected. Amazing room, pool, bar, free yoga on a Monday and beach access across the street in the sister hotel Encantada made it even better. Everything we could have hoped for and more.",50,605
"Care is taken with every detail. The location is gorgeous, the decor perfect, the music is chill, the food is exquisite.. The waiters are sweet and gentle… A perfect day really… shhh don’t tell everyone… Located in the jungle, under the sun, the perfect place to relax or catch up on work…",50,605
"Alejandro and Edwin are awesome. Great breakfast at Radhoo hotel. The hotel atmosphere is incredible. Ana, Ivan and Abby are very kind and supportive. They arranged a romantic dinner for us and everything was perfect.",50,605
Definitely a must stay for anyone looking to relax and have the stress melt away.  Ana and team were beyond hospitable.  They made sure not one request went incomplete and always put a smile on our face.,50,605
"I recently stayed at Radhoo (which was reserved for Wedding guests). The couple must have done their homework. They wanted their guests to feel top notch comfort, service, and the best amenities. The rooms are clean, surpringly spacious despite being a small imprint. Our room faced into the West and directly bordered the natural jungle and greenery. It felt like a paradise to wake up to this every AM. The staff were amazing. They checked on their guests throughout the stay. The site is not great for cell service but whatsapp and their on site wifi did the trick. The on site restaurant is fantastic. Breakfast was complimentary (which was a huge plus considering Tulum has become pricey overall). This was also part of the wedding venue (their pool was used as a covered dance floor",50,605
"I spent hours researching hotels in Tulum before I made a reservation. I wanted luxury without an exorbitant price; an authentic Tulum vibe, not some generic, corporate hotel atmosphere; beauty and style in the rooms and location; and a destination where I could just relax and enjoy.   Hotel Panamera is all these things and more. It exceeded my most optimistic expectations. The staff was welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out. They got to know us by name during the week we stayed. They provided advice about where to go and what to do in Tulum. They took care of us each time we went to the restaurant or to the beach or the pool. Coco, who supervises the pool and beach and the restaurant that serves both, was magnificent. Whenever we arrived at the",50,606
" beach, she was there to provide all the services we wanted--towels for the lounges, an umbrella to shade us, servers to take our orders for drink and food. During any given afternoon, she would check on us to make sure we got whatever we wanted. The beach was lovely, even if it had banks of seaweed that washed ashore as the tide came in. The pool was relaxing. Try an Aperol spritz while you lounge near the water. It' s my new favorite drink.   The rooms have a simple, spare beauty. The rain shower was just perfect after a day at the beach. The staff changed sheets and towels and cleaned each day. The rooftop bar has a glorious view of the sunset. Everything was superb. It's an easy walk to the Biosphere (1 mile) and to wonderful restaurants (1 kilometer or less).   We had an ideal vacation. I recommend the hotel with the greatest enthusiasm. I just hope that everybody doesn't flock to this jewel of Tulum, because I want to be able to get a reservation next year.",50,606

Definitely will come back next year. keep up the good work",30,606
"We picked this hotel for our honeymoon solely because of pictures of the pool.  What we encountered was a perfectly curated balance of isolation and cool vibes.  This beach club offers picturesque ocean access and the most chill/vacation music playlist sounding all day.   The restaurant has classic food options that are well executed -chef approved ;) - and service was friendly and attentive without feeling overwhelming (they leave you alone if you want them to).  If you like to party; there’s an event scheduled every day either in the beach front of the rooftop bar.  If you like to relax and get away from everyone, they offer early morning yoga and health shots.   The rooms were a minimalist dream. All the necessary, none of the frills.

"The hotel common areas are beautiful, the staff very friendly and attentive, and we enjoyed the convenience of ordering food and drinks from the restaurant while lounging at the beach. The staff is ready to accommodate umbrellas when the sun gets harsh which was perfect for us. You do have to get there early to claim chairs though! It is also a beach club that can be used by those who aren’t necessarily staying in the hotel.   My 3 star review is for the actual rooms. They are bare bones, almost to the point of being uncomfortable. The walls are thin so you can hear everything at all times. I was expecting the rooms to align with the rest of the hotel.  They do have parking which was a plus as we rented a car from National Car Rental to drive from the airport to Tulum.",50,606
"A beach front and pool hotel with amazing roof top for unreal sunsets and tasty food.   Location, decor, staff, service, music, drinks... everything was perfect!

"Great property. The design thoughtful and absolutely spot on for the location and positioning of an excellent boutique hotel it has a great beach, great pool setup, a new rooftop sunset bar. Their biggest strength however is The team which is great and very well trained. Especially david at the front desk and Carlos on the beach. Reminds me a lot of soho house vibe, the design especially of soho house miami. The only areas of improvement would be elevate the F&B, perhaps add some more storage in the rooms and for sure bathrooms need sliding doors! Will definitely stay here again and have already recommended to friends.",50,606
"Hotel Tiki Tiki was perfect in every way. The staff & staff cats are all amazing!! The staff, especially Yesica and Melissa, we’re so helpful with anything we needed. The breakfast each morning was beyond delicious. & Damien was the best bartender in all of Tulum! We will 100% be back!!",50,607

"What an amazing place in crazy Tulum. We stayed 7 nights with our 11 year old daughter. The room was incredible, lost in nature. You wake up with the sound of beautiful birds. We even spotted Toucans! Very nice pool with beautiful settings. There is a rooftop terrace which has amazing view on the jungle. The staff is super friendly and super helpful They gave us the best tips and made our holiday. We even felt sad to say good-bye. Tiki Tiki also has the best bartender in town, def check it out! Breakfast was simple, but very good quality products and super nice.  Really nothing to complain about. Sending all our love!",50,607
"i love a hotel with a strong concept and this one certainly has one - Mexicana meets mid-century Miami, which is successfully executed and super stylish in an understated yet colourful way.  But the best thing about this hotel is the staff - especially Melissa and Yesica at reception, as well as Damian at the bar.  The girls went out of their way to help and were so friendly and nice.  Great for solo travellers, I felt super safe at all times and you can walk to restaurants and cafes nearby, although the place itself is secluded and quiet. I can do nothing but wholeheartedly recommend this great hotel!  ",50,607
"My wife and I had a a wonderful stay at Hotel Tiki Tiki. The pool was great, crafty and clean with a beautiful green surrounding and bird sounds. The bar food (quesadillas) great and homemade drink Tiki Tiki was refreshing and needed after a long day in Tulum. The breakfast is fresh and that includes fresh squeezed orange juice among other baked breads that are delightful. I recommend hotel especially if you rent a car, since they offer free parking. Wish the beds were softer but everything and all of the staff,  amazing!",50,607
"Overall, I loved staying at Tiki Tiki. Quiet, the sound of birds in the morning and evening. Well maintained and clean. The aesthetic is beautiful. Staff was very friendly and constantly helpful, spoke really good english. Breakfast was sufficient, fruits and granola, bread with jam of butter with coffee or tea. Room had AC. My room faced the jungle and had a lovely balcony.  The main reason I removed 1 star is the location. Tiki Tiki is at the very end of Tulum which means everything takes a while to get to. If you have a car this really won't be a big deal because Tulum isn't very big. But if your biking (they have bikes to rent) or walking, that sun KILLS you getting place to place. Holistika's Tierra is a 2 min walk (I personally wasn't a huge fan of the food) and any other",40,607

We loved waking up every morning surrounded by the sounds of nature, our toucan family that lived by our balcony and the soothing swaying sounds of the treetops. The playlist in the lobby is also superb! You can also use the facilities at their sister hotel Holistika at the end of the block.

"This spacious and clean house/hotel seems to be designed and run as a corporate retreat. We rented it as 4 women with 4 kids. It didn’t suit our needs as it wasn’t private and secluded as we had hoped. There are a lot of very helpful and friendly staff around outside the hotel and in the hotel. The pool and yard are visible to the neighboring house, which can be rented as well. It’s the not the kind of place to unwind and watch a movie in your underclothes as someone may walk in at any moment and restock your coffee (which is kind and appreciated, don’t get me wrong, it’s just not a private home). There is no television. It’s very sparse and the decor can feel cold (there are some built in cushioned benches, but no actual sofa). That said, it is a pretty home, just not cozy and",30,608

Beds are comfortable, a/c and fans in the room, kitchen is basic but has everything you need. The bathroom has ""saloon"" type doors so not complete privacy in case that's an issues.  Plenty of parking in front for a golf cart.  If you want to stay away from the noise and activity from Centro this is a great option.",40,610
"This was our 1st visit to Isla Mujeres and it was amazing.  We enjoyed being in the Colonias, the view & we were close to lots of restaurants & shops.  The room was comfortable and the a/c worked well & the bed was very comfortable.  We also enjoyed getting to know the couples that came and went in the other 3 units there.  Joyce provided a ton of info before we arrived and there was a great guest book upon arrival....all very helpful.  Joyce and Bob were wonderful & we are so glad we got to meet them.  We would absolutely recommend Casitas del Mar & we look forward to coming back and staying here again.    John & Wendy",50,610

The casita just offers a place to relax and dream.",50,610

We did have a issue with the internet and they were all over it and had it fixed. The owners were so nice and helpful. They even gave us a ride at 6am. The view from right out front was amazing. We love this place. Really loved the book of tips they give you. This is the prefect place for a couple.,50,610

All this comes with the ocean at your doorstep, and a palapa to sit enjoying your morning coffee or your evening cocktail. All this for a price that can't be beat on the island. Heaven!",50,610
"This was our first visit to Isla, Casitas del Mar was the perfect spot to stay.  Away from the busy downtown and north beach but easily walkable to wherever you want to go.  The casitas are fully equipped; beautiful bedding; ocean views.  Owners Bob and Joyce; were not only hospitable but very helpful on things to do; restaurants to visit.   We rented a golf cart one day for 8 hours which was more than enough time to circle the island to see all it has to offer.  A day spent on north beach was great! We walked to most spots and taxis are readily available for the times we did not want to! Overall a great experience",50,610
"Casitas Del Mar was a fabulous spot for our first trip to the Isla Mujeres.  It was a perfect size and had absolutely everything we needed for our stay.  Bob and Joyce were fantastic hosts.

Loved the location within an easy walk to some of the best restaurants on the island...  Bastos, Limon, Oscars, Deisy & Raul El Charco, Mango Cafe, so great.  Great value.  The room had everything you need with its small kitchen, coffee pot, etc.  One of the highlights was walking across the street to sit and watch the beautiful sunrise over the Carribean.",50,610
Casitas del Mar is a perfect place to stay if you want to be out of the busy downtown area but still have all that you need within walking distance!  Waking up each morning to take a walk along the Carribean side of the ocean was good for the soul.  Sitting under the palapas in the evening and feeling the ocean breeze was beautiful and relaxing. We were able to rent two casitas (one for my husband and I and the other for my son) for an extremely affordable price and had all we needed to make our stay comfortable and perfect. A special thank you to Monica for the wonderful communication during the rental process and throughout our stay! Highly recommend!,50,610

We were not the only ones!  Other customers were stranded in a remote island without assistance. We have been told that this is Worldmarks standard for customer care.  Cancel your customer, put them on an endless hold and then leave them to figure it out for themselves.  Worldmark will mess up your vacation and leave you to clean up their mess.  Thank you to the local staff who provided help.  Corporate Worldmark is run by a bunch of amateurs. Pathetic and unprofessional.  ",10,611

The studio rooms are clean and have a microwave, mini fridge and coffee maker.  There is a grocery about 2 blocks away that is similar to a Walmart.  We took a rolling bag with us and packed our groceries in it for the walk back (we bought big jugs of water)  You can also rent a golf cart and that makes the trip easy.  You can go anywhere on the island on a golf cart. Taxi from the ferry(north beach area) to the hotel is about $5 and the golf cart is $55 a day.  Fun place to visit, my family wants to return!!!!",50,611

Alex and Alberto went out of their way to help us in any way we needed, even called an ordered a delivery dinner for us one night! I called the resort ahead of my trip and arranged golf cart rental.  It is the easiest way to get around the island. The swim up bar at the pool was fun, Charlie took good care of us. The location mid island is great for exploring either up north in the town, or go south to the Cliff of Dawn, Garrafon park, and the Dolphin adventure. There is plenty of live music at small venues bar/restaurants. The Joint is great, as is el Patio for live music. Go have fun!",50,611
I wanted to Love this resort but it just didn't deliver.  The headache of having to trek all your luggage on the ferry was exhaustive.  The resort itself is adorable but not very comfortable.  The one bedroom that sleeps four truly only sleeps two (couples only).  The sofa bed is something weird and was incredibly uncomfortable for my guest.  They even bought a mattress to accomdate.  The unit are very cute but hard and insects everywhere.  They really need to spray.  I think this might be the only WM I won't come back too. Highly disappointed.  The restaurant at the end of the road though was delicious.,30,611
"We really enjoyed this resort.  Staff was great, grounds and room was clean and well cared for. On a previous day trip to Isla Mujeres we had stopped by on a whim and were given a tour of the resort. When planning for a 2 month trip to the Riviera Maya we wanted to spend a few nights here. Of course the resort was pretty full and only a few night’s available.  Worldmark reservations were a big help to get 3 nights in the type of room we wanted. The property is beautiful with a unique design and setting around a round pool with a bar and restaurant owned by the adjacent marina. Luxury yachts were moored nearby. Easy to buy drinks and meals.  Alberto was great and always eager to help. Check-in and out was super easy. They usually have golf carts to rent, just call. This was high",50,611
" season and golf carts can be hard to find. Golf carts are a great way to get around on this small island. Taxis also would work well and are inexpensive, but do not give you the freedom to explore. There is also a bus system but did not use it. The resort is located mid-island so not really walkable to to the north end which has more going on.  We stayed in. Studio Hotel King.  Coffee pot, small microwave, small fridge. Nice room on the ground floor.  All rooms look out on the pool and have hammocks and 2 chairs and a table on patio.  Places we would recommend: Playa Norte and Las Hermachas Beach Club. Beautiful beach and water. You can rent lounges/umbrella for 300 pesos or, as we did, sit at a table free and order food and drinks. Zama Beach Club was great!  Nice setting, great beach, pool, bar and seating at different levels.  The water was not the same blue color and not as sandy when walking in the water. Fantastic shrimp tacos and the deep fried tortilla with shrimp is fantastic.  No rental, just consumption.  Green Verde is nearby and excellent!  Others are The Soggy Peso ( don’t let the entrance deter you) and Big Daddy’s Beach Bar with corn hole tourney on Friday nights.  Ferry was about 20 minutes and easy to use. We would have stayed an extra night (room available) but would have had to buy a Housekeeping- wish WM would change this!  Loved the resort and Isla!  Would stay again in a minute!",40,611

"We had a memorable week long holiday stay here for Christmas. Our family had two king bed rooms, but they were not near each other. One had the mini pool on the balcony, a mini fridge, a microwave, and a very big bathroom with ample drawer storage. The other had a full kitchenette, balcony with hammock, and a tiny bathroom with no drawer storage anywhere. It was so strange that one room had tons of drawers while in the other we had to live out of our suitcases strewn on the floor. We had what we needed in our kitchen, so that was great, and they gave us over a gallon of water, some coffee and some spices. They have WiFi (that was free for us) but it is inconsistent as you get farther from the pool. The pool is beautiful but it’s very chilly and there is no hot tub. The pool bar",20,611
" is expensive and we ordered from the restaurant once and it really wasn’t very good - both of these are affiliated with the resort but are managed by the marina. There is no payment agreement between the resort and the marina unless you set it up ahead of time, so be sure to water have money on hand or set it up when you check in (for some reason this wasn’t mentioned when we checked in because we would’ve set that up for sure).  The office worked hard to help us with anything, like fixing the a/c once, ordering golf carts, and arranging a pedicure. The best thing from a time share property? They never asked us to do a presentation!! The resort is well maintained and has some beautiful grounds. There is as security gate and we felt safe there. It is on the water (a marina) but not with beach access or really anywhere to sit by the water. It is very close walking distance to Chedraui, which is like Walmart (go to main road and turn right). Also there are several good restaurants right in the neighborhood. We enjoyed Greenverde (turn left, super close) and another very close local place (can’t remember the name, but it had a green awning, main road almost directly out from the resort) for great cheap nachos and tacos. We did feel like we needed the golf cart to get the most out of our days, except for one day we just relaxed at the resort. If you rent it later in the afternoon, it’ll span over almost two days since it’s a 24 hour rental (we did 4:00pm-4:00pm and had it for afternoon exploring, dinner, then all day the next day at the beach, shopping, lunch, until we were exhausted anyway!).

"We arrived Feb 26-March 5. I generally always stay at a Riu but this was the first time I have stayed at a Riu Palace. It was so amazing! The staff was unreal. So nice. Super sweet and very friendly! You could really tell they appreciated my business. It was also my bday during this trip and we didn’t tell any staff. They decorated our bed with balloons and made a bday cake out of the towels and out fresh rose petals on it. I felt so good when I saw it. Then we went for lunch and came back to the room and yet another surprise awaited me! A bottle of champagne, chocolate covered strawberries and a bday card. They must have noticed in my passport but I felt so blessed. The food here is absolutely incredible!! The buffet was awesome too. I loved it. We both did! The rooms were",50,612
My 24-year old daughter and I loved our stay at Las Palmas.  Kate is such a warm and welcoming host which is evidenced by all the regulars who stay there every year.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was a little small for 2 women but it worked fine for us and the outdoor community areas at the hotel are so beautiful and everyone we met was so friendly.  The hotel is in a perfect location very close to everything and quiet and safe at night.  My only regret is we didn't stay longer.  I definitely would stay at Las Palmas when I return to beautiful Isla Mujeres!,50,613
"I just returned from a lovely 17 day stay at Las Palmas. The first 11 days were with my husband and the last week was with my sister celebrating her 60th birthday! To say it was a beautiful,relaxing, sunny vacation is an understatement. It was just the best in so many ways!   Las Palmas made it simple with its fantastic location 2 blocks from the most beautiful beach, Playa Norte, 1 block from the great shops and restaurants on Hildago, and directly across the street from 3 delicious places to grab breakfast or lunch.  We have given up on vacations in Florida with their “iffy” weather and are sold on Mexico with one day of warm sunshine after another.   Las Palmas has great amenities and open air spaces to socialize with other guests or just to enjoy breakfast or cocktails with",50,613
" your own significant other or family. We spent very little time in our room with all of these open spaces and their beautiful breezes. They provide water and lots of drinks and snacks at very reasonable prices.  Kate is a great resource for information about the island and recommendations. There are many places not to be missed mid-island as well and a taxi ride is $5 at most.   It is a beautiful island filled with sunshine, sand, water, music and great food and drinks! Las Palmas is a friendly gem in the center of it all with a great owner who will help insure you have a great time. We look forward to booking with Kate again soon!",50,613

"This is my second review for Las Palmas.   You may or may not get the flavour of the island staying in a resort facility, but you certainly will staying at the Las Palmas. And the flavour is riddled with relax, take your time, chill out while you warm your winter bones, eat, drink, and definitely be merry.   Located in the north downtown district and one street parallel to the busy pedestrian tourist shop and restaurant laden calle Hidalgo, Las Palmas is ideally situated. A quick walk takes you off to the Playa Norte, a generous expanse of perfectly white sand and shallow, soupy, cerulean Caribbean sea. A couple minutes in the opposite direction brings you to a lovely sea wall walkway: the Malecón. Small shops are scattered all about, selling anything from tourist trinkets,",50,613
" t-shirts, beach cover-ups, cervezas, to pastries; and, even an excellent matcha latte can be purchased. An artisan collective one block over offers up all of the above (except the drinks) and will even on-the-spot sew you a dress made from the huge selection of stacked cloth. Should you need a pharmacy, there are several nearby. Rent a golf cart? A mere few paces to your right out the hotel door.   Oh, about the hotel! Think bohemian. Think colourful. Think down to earth friendly and comfortable. There are cheerful murals of tropical plants that mirror the tremendous number of actual thriving tropical plants which provide life and colour at every glance around the hotel. Locally collected shells and fossilized coral add even more visual interest. The rooms are all outfitted with comfortable beds and pillows (essential for us travellers), have a/c (essential for us northern folk), and a fridge to stash your water or preferred liquid du jour. Every day the maids (Noemi, Ana, Gaby) will straighten up your linens, refresh your towels, sweep out any sand tracked in….please tip them well, they truly earn it.   Special mention must be made of the communal kitchen. It is located on the spacious second deck (there is a first deck, too!) which also has all manner of tables, chairs, hammocks, chaise longues open to the sun or under shade AND a dipping pool to cool off after a walk about. There’s a grocery mercado directly across the street where you can buy most anything you need to whip up meals in this kitchen. There’s a big fridge to store your goods so you don’t have to cart them back and forth from the fridge in your room. The kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to cook and to eat that meal you make. Need a snack or a bottle of water or perhaps beer? There’s a good supply handy right there for a nominal fee in a separate bevvie fridge. Every so often there’ll be an announcement of a fish fry night. Bring a few pesos and join in, make a salad or a pasta dish to share if you want, or just kick back and enjoy the camaraderie. Or not, your choice.  Your fellow travellers. Many - but not all - people staying at Las Palmas are repeat customers and often they stay for significant periods of time. For this set of eclectic visitors, a month’s stay is not at all out of the ordinary. Without exception, they are sociable, inclusive, and happy to share their own experiences at the hotel and on the island. Don’t be surprised to be invited to take part in social events - pool night while watching a game at Snappers for example. Maybe just sit and shoot the breeze over a cerveza or vino tinto at night’s end. The decks at night are magical. Fairy lights, street sounds, food scents from Hidalgo all lend ambiance to the lovely surroundings.  By the way, if you’re not feeling particularly sociable, no worries. You won’t be intruded upon. Feel perfectly comfortable reading, working a crossword, or just snoozing in one of those inviting long chairs and no one will disturb your peace.   The hotel people. Katie owns and runs the hotel. She is a fount of knowledge. Ask her. She’ll be happy to chat with you. You might even get an invitation to go out with her at some point on her Las Palmas golf cart (the usual mode of island transportation) to do some shopping at the one big department/grocery store on the island: Chedraui. If Katie isn’t on site, her number one assistant, Taina, will be. Only speak English? No problem. Only Spanish? Also no problem. Taina speaks both, and the maids all speak Spanish. Also ready to give you a hand and welcome you in are Cindy and Steve. They help Katie manage the hotel from December to March during the busiest season. You will find them when you walk into the hotel - and stop dead in your tracks to take in the lush open courtyard tropical garden of skyward reaching palms. Close your mouth, they’re real and wonderful. As are the people in this lovely Las Palmas hotel. Don’t forget to give Cachito a scrub on the noggin’. He’s Katie’s wee doggo and he follows her everywhere.",50,613

"Just returned from spending 10 days at Hotel Las Palmas. This is an ideal place to stay in Isla for the solo traveler or for anyone wanting to meet other travelers. From the beginning Kate was extremely helpful in providing information and guidance on how to experience the island. Las Palmas has a 'hostel for adults' feel about it (I'm in my 60's) with many beautiful communal areas to choose from, whether you want to relax by yourself or socialize with others.   Great quiet location, close to the main road for access to many restaurants and live music entertainment spots, and just a few minutes walk to beautiful Playa Norte (the beach)   Highly recommend!",50,613
"Great place to stay, clean and well kept. Can’t beat the rooftop patio and outdoor kitchen, especially if staying with a group. Kate is extremely helpful and knowledgeable with everything on the island and speaks perfect English, too!",50,613
"My husband and I just spent 2 glorious weeks at the Hotel Las Palmas.  We have been to the island many times and stayed in many different hotels.  We prefer smaller family  Owned and operated hotels with their own distinctive atmosphere and Las Palmas is the absolute best on so many levels!  The staff are welcoming and genuine—they make you feel like family and are there to help!  The rooms are very well equipped with top quality comfortable beds and beautiful bedding.  The location is absolutely ideal!, 4 minutes from north beach, surrounded by awesome restaurants and across the street from the market and the best traditional food on the island.  The absolute highlight of this hotel is the roof top common area where there is a cooling pool, a shared outdoor kitchen that is",50,613
"This hotel is situated on a lovely property with a pool, small beach, and restaurant. Unfortunately, our room had a street view, but it was a nice room with vaulted ceilings and a private patio. One small thing to note, the bathroom door is made of wood slats, and if you're chilling in the bedroom you can see right into the bathroom. If you're traveling with people you're not comfortable with seeing in the bathroom, maybe book a few more rooms. Our stay was nice and quiet, the staff is somewhat helpful. We asked them to call us a taxi a few times and it took 30+ minutes to arrive. So customer service isn't their first priority, so just be aware of that. The location is right in the middle of the island which is great, but it is not very walkable to downtown and the restaurants.",40,615

Guests at Marina Paraiso often played the music so loudly in the boat that it could be heard at other businesses even when I was inside with the door and windows closed. When we asked for the music to be turned down it was turned up even louder. They broadcast the music to outside speakers.It was not all guests but one boat in particular. One day they broadcast what sounded like a porno movie. Not cool.,40,615
"We just returned from a 10 day stay. Nothing fancy but very comfortable and clean rooms. Great staff. Very good food at the outdoor restaurant and separate bar. One tip, take your mosquito and no seeum spray. Those critters on the island are really hungry.   ",50,615
"We moved south from the north beach to adopt a puppy from Isla animals. It was the perfect spot to bond with our new family member. A very peaceful setting with beautiful views of the ocean and pool right from our room. Good food and friendly service. We could walk to the massive grocery store and there were restaurants along the way. Nice bathroom, and firm but comfortable beds. The TV worked well but we only used it one night.   WiFi was available in the pool, restaurant and bar area. This drove my 13 year old nuts but he started enjoying lounging around the pool in the evenings. We felt very safe there. He could play on his phone and listen to the peaceful sounds of the wind blowing through the trees. The sunsets were spectacular. If, or when we go back we will be staying",10,615

The breakfast is great and we have tried the pizza for lunch which is also good. Pool is amazing and so are the views. All of the staff here are kind and helpful. It is a very peaceful place to stay. The view of the marina is wonderful. I highly recommend staying here, great value.....bring your bug spray and have some nice relaxing down time! ",50,615
Showed up here with my sailboat 46 foot beneteau once I was tied up I came face-to-face with the owner witch is absolutely rude.He then went on to ask me if we had rented a room and that if not I would need to leave...the fact that we were ready to spend money at his restaurant and paid for a dock for overnight didn't seem enough for him. I don't recommend this place don't want to encourage this type of behavior from an owner!,30,615
"Amazing condo! The wrap around balcony/deck is the best part of this place and the condo itself is pretty fantastic. Great location on Playa Norte in Isla Mujeres. There are several stairs to your condo but the view and space is worth it! Comfortable beds, full kitchen, friendly and incredibly helpful staff. Will recommend & stay again!",50,616
"Beatiful place. Tropical water. We didn't eat here, so can't help with the food  reviews.  However,we got quoted a price of $150 for 6 people  to rent beach chairs and 3 drinks per person, Instead we were charged $240.00 Needless to say, WE WON'T BE COMING BACK",20,616
"Excellent location on the island!! Excellent staff and the Condos are Absolutely Phabulous!!! Highly recommend!!! The pool is ALL YOURS! Restricted to only guests, so it makes it Super Peaceful!! Right on the Beach!!!  Their Restaurant is also a 4 star Restaurant!! ",50,616
"I have stayed at this resort a total of 5 times. Every time I come back the stay is better than the last. Waking up early to the birds chirping and napping on the beach all day while drinking pina coladas was my agenda for the time I stayed. Something about it feeling not as commercial and having a traditional feel makes the experience all the better.  The cleaning service is more than exceptional. Making friends here was an ease because everyone is very kind and just there to have fun. another great part of this resort is the judgement free environment. I love it because nobady could care less what you look like or what you are doing If you are like me you are not going to be spending a lot of time in the condo but rather out exploring the island, eating, swimming and spending",50,616

This is a great mid-range complex; not luxurious but a great value for the price.  Reception and check in was fast and efficient. Grounds are very well-maintained, pool is nice and never too busy and staff is friendly.  There is a restaurant in front of the condos (not part of the resort) called Mayan Beach Club that has good food and very reasonable prices.  Our unit, 24, was impeccably clean and well appointed.

"If you’re coming during May-August and are escaping the seaweed plague of Cancun/Playa del Carmen, this is the place to be. The hotel staff is very nice and accommodating (especially Romi!) the bar and restaurant are at your disposal via room service and beach service. The beach is quite literally attached to the hotel (basically in its backyard). It has the best beach in all of the island (Playa Norte) with clear waters and soft white sand. And as if all that wasn’t enough, the main shopping and dining street of the island are 1 minute away by foot. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because on the weekends, the locals have the ability to rent out the beach and this leads to *loud* music being played sometimes past 5 am.

We were very sceptical because of the lack of current reviews and the older reviews were not appealing at all. Well let me just tell you we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and checked into our villa Elsa and still scratching our heads as to  why there wasn’t a ton of great reviews. The villa was tastefully furnished and clean. The villa had everything we needed from kitchen utensils, appliances, beach towels and many more miscellaneous items for our comfort and care. We took a stroll to check out the pool and private beach. And it just kept getting better. The beach had a swing bar and also chairs to lay on in the white powdery sand and sunbathe. Beside the pool was a",50,620
" covered rooftop area with a large table and chairs to enjoy the pool or beach with a light for night time use. I enjoyed some peaceful mornings having my coffee there enjoying the view. The grounds are well kept. Lots of lush trees, flowers and plants. The villas are behind a locked door for extra peace of mind, although never once did I feel unsafe especially in this area. There is a beach club next door and we worried when we seen the catamarans pulling in full of a crowd and although there is a sign stating private property a few people would come and snap some photos but were respectful and went on about there day. The music next door was never intrusive. We like to socialize and and have fun but nothing to crazy and this place was perfect for us. I found this place to be very private but not to isolated. We have always stayed at 4 and 5 star resorts and we cannot wait to stay here again. I understand now why the reviews are lacking.. people don’t want to reveal this hidden gem. The owner is very responsive and the price is very reasonable. If you’re looking for a larger place oceanfront ask about unit 1. We stayed in unit 6 and our family friends stayed in unit 5 after they came to visit us here. If I have to write a negative I would say bring an e xtra blanket for the bed since it may be cooler at night and the property manager said there were no extra blankets available.

There are 6 units, of which 2 are used as rentals, the others are used by local families, the families are not noisy, so it is actually quiet for the most part.  Any extra noise is from the Velavante Beach Club usually 12 PM - 5 PM when it gets quite busy as they bring in boatloads of people from Cancun or wherever and they have a open bar and of course free music.  It is entertaining for a while, but it gets old when the beach club people come onto our adjacent beach.  The units have 2 bedrooms on two levels, plus a third level for sunning, but I rarely used the 3rd level",50,620
" except to check the weather.  They have large refrigerator, washer, dryer, kitchen, stove and oven, mexican cable in one bedroom and internet, but no toaster or dishwasher (you are the dishwasher).  These are housekeeping units, so no daily or weekly maid service, and you take out your own trash.  You do get 5 gallon water containers and can ask for more, 4 beach towels as well as bath towels, soap and TP.  You will need to get your own laundry detergent.    Occasionally, you will get more free music at night from clubs, but they are not close, and actually they can be quite good.  There is a pool that is large, but not as clean as I would like.  The property also has a bar palapa that has some working electrical outlets, and also working water.  Speaking of working, not everything worked.  I did not have at various times, water, hot water, electrical service, gas for the stove or working keys.  Each of these were resolved with emails to the caretaker Sue, but may take a day to resolve.  Once you find the breakers, you can get water and hot water.  Not all of the lights work either, but there is enough for you to function.  The internet service worked fine, but the range is not great.  At the end of the day we liked the landscaping and the private nature of this place (when the club people are not around), and yes I would return again.",10,620

"I have been to Isla many times.  We have stayed in the Villas in their hay day, but those days are over.  We drove by to look at it, because it held a special place in my heart at one time. This place is run down.  They list the rooms for $20 on their sign and all you get is a bed.  There is no hot water, no air conditioning, nothing but a bed.  Whomever is posting these current reviews is not being honest.  It is really sad that someone would try to cheat people coming to this beautiful island.  Do not stay here unless you like camping out in a run down hotel.",50,620
"I have visited Isla Mujeres 3 times prior to this last visit. This time, we were going to stay for 10 days. The first 5 days we stood in Hotel Cabanas Maria Del Mar in Playa Norte. We were with a group of friends, so the location was perfect. One day, we were driving around the island an came upon the floating house. Directly in front of it was Villas Hi Na Ha. We decided to look around. The grounds were gorgeous as were the rooms! We decided that for our last 5 days on the island we would stay there. This was the best idea! I completely fell in love with the villa and the location. In the morning, we were served breakfast right by the pool, some fruit, coffee, eggs, etc. It was fantastic! During the day, we lounged out on the beach had some beer courtesy of Sergio (he cooked",30,620
" the breakfast, cleaned the pool, served the beer, basically helped take care of the place, GREAT person), he even let us plug in our ipod the speakers so we can listen to some nice Bosa Nova and Gypsy Kings right by the water. I took a dip in the pool which is a few steps up from the beach. At night, the sunset was one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL sunset I've seen. If you have seen the sunsets at Playa Norte, you will understand the beauty of sunsets on Isla. Hammocks and couches line the pool area, beautiful flowers and gardens, full of color...I have no complaints at all. Carlos the owner of the place was a fabulous host and I thank him for making our stay super comfortable and relaxing.   I was looking for a place where I can relax, get inspiration to write and just clear my mind of my busy life in New York City. I can honestly say, without a doubt, that Villas Hi Na Ha was that exact place. If I created the place myself, it couldn't have been any more perfect. I will definitely stay there hopefully EVERY time I vist Isla. Just an FYI - Carlos the owner is very helpful and the so-so reviews are probably from people that visited the place years ago before Hurricane Wilma hit the island. The place has been renovated since. If you are looking to stay there, please feel free to email me (mlbellaro@gmail.com) and I can send you my personal photos of the Villa.   Michele & Anthony :)",10,620

"Die Casa Talavera befindet sich im Herzen von Isla Mujeres, man ist sehr schnell am Markt oder in den Restaurants. Das Zimmer 1 fand ich schön und praktisch eingerichtet, sowohl die Klimaanlage wie auch der Ventilator funktionieren tadellos. Und im Korridor hat es einen Wasserspender, der ist Gold wert. Vom Balkon aus kann man das Treiben in den Gassen beobachten, bevor man aus dem Haus geht. ",50,621
"Great view of the sunset whether there clouds or not. This is what the tropics are all about. This time we did not eat but just had a happy hour beverage. Wait staff was very attentive, in the past the food has been great.",40,622
"The room was as pictured. Bed was hard. Pillows were flat. Blanket was actually a sheet. Refrigerator froze the top shelf but not the lower and turned on and off loudly. There was hot water in the shower. I was provided a large bottle of drinkable water since I stayed for the week and could not drink the tap water. Corner balcony was perfect for enjoying the waves, sun, boats in the distance and view of distant Cancun. Maids were friendly and efficient. Other than relentless mosquitos I had no other bugs. The ceiling fan was perfect all day although air-conditioning worked perfectly and appeared new. There is a restaurant but they open at 10 a.m. and close by 5 p.m. There is very little within walking distance and by 6 p.m. all food and drink spots are closed (kitchens close at",40,622
" 5 p.m.) Renting a golf cart is a great investment and made exploring the island, hanging out at all the remote beach sites and eating at the fun places in the north shore or central island a breeze and very enjoyable. This hotel advertises that they are next to the Garrison Park and share the same reef for snorkeling but that is not exactly right. It cost $39 to snorkel the reef which is actually roped off from this hotel and government operated with admission through the park.  They will whistle you out! But the reef is beautiful especially at sunrise with dappled light, amazing colors and tons of fish and not to be missed; so strategize and go through the hotel and swim along the beach towards the park before the park staff arrives (before 9 a.m. on Weekends, 10 a.m. on weekdays and evenings after the park closes).  Stay close to there reef but don't touch it.  I think it could be the last remaining truly awesome coral reef in Isla Mujeres.  Staying at this hotel allows you discreet access to the abundant reef since you can approach it in the water through the hotel beach, so getting a hotel room is worth every penny) Otherwise even the hotel (as well as the park) don't open until 10 a.m. They are trying to fancy it up, too, with new paint and trimmed landscaping. But the location was quiet (lots of vacancies because of the location), no competitive amenities, great snorkeling, very small sand beach area, decent price. I would return there because of the coral reef.  And, the golf cart rental made it work. Taking a taxi in and out of town at $5+dollars a pop each way would have made this site too far from the action and difficult to justify. This was a good value for the price if you are looking for quiet, private, snorkeling, reef, beach front.",30,622

"We went back to this hotel in December, a few years after our first visit.  The beach and view are still a plus, but there were more problems. We, too, encountered the red ants mentioned in another review, although we changed rooms (to the side closer to the cafe) and didn't have a further problem. Breakfast is no longer included and is now hard to get, since no restaurants within walking distance are open early. Staff is friendly, and they seem to be working on some needed repairs to the buildings.",30,622
"The hotel really looked great upon arrival. Great view, banana trees in the surroundings and every room with balcony.   We left our bags in the room and then took a cab (quite a drive, almost 10 km from the town) in to town. When we got back in the evening (after another long cab drive) we inspected our room more carefully. Well, it was nothing great - a typical early 80'ies decoration, but it seemed clean. When getting in to bed I found a ded ""dried up"" ant, but I thought nothing of it... bugs can get in sometimes. After we put the lights out and tried to get to sleep, we soon felt a crawling... bursting out of bed and hitting the lights, we found thousands of red ants (they bite!) in the room! On the floor, the cieling, the walls, the bed! Everywhere!   We ran up to the",10,622
" reception where and eldery man sat who didn't speak a word english. He did know what we meant though and came back with us to the room bringing a bugspray... but the spray did little good as there were sooo many ants! He actually used up the whole can, but the ants just keept on coming. It was like a horror movie and I started to cry. We went up to the reception with the man and wanted him to call a cab for us. He said that no cabs were operative after midnight. We stared calling ourselves and of course ther were cabs! He just lied not wanting us to leave!!! We finally took a cab back to town and found the wonderful hotell ""Villa Rolandi"" where there was (to our great luck) a room available.  The next day we went back to get our money back from this nightmare hotel. (because, of course we had to prepay our stay...) First they didn't want us to get our money back and offered us another room. I asked the receptionist if there were ants there and she said ""well, not that many as in your first room"". We declined, of course. Then we had too threaten with the tourist office to get them to agree on giving us our money back. We got almost all our money back, but not for the first night (and we didn't even spend the night and had to pay for another hotel). I asked the receptionist if she upon our ariival knew of the ant problem and after some lame excuses, she admitted that she did...   Overall, this was an experience from hell! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!",40,622
…,40,622
"Good for budget, nice kitchen, quiet. Verry comfortables room with good beds. Security and two minutes walk from the amazing Playa Norte Beach.  I recommend the room at the 2nd level in the middle (more space and bigger bath room)",50,623
"I never write reviews but after the experience I had here I felt compelled to share my experience.   If you're travelling alone don't stay here! Alex, the owner, just wants to make as much money as he possibly can from you. He asked me to stay in a room down the road from the hotel in the backyard of what looked like a rubbish dump.   During my stay I came home to find my door wide open, at night. I asked Alex why this may have happened and instead he accused it of being my fault. He called his cleaner in an attempt to find out why my door was left open for what must have been hours as she came at midday and it was now after sunset. The owner felt no sympathy for my situation and for my vulnerability as a young girl. He continued to try and make money from me by attempting to",10,623
" move me to another cheaper room which was extremely uncomfortable. I would not be left alone in any of this decision making with the friends I was with.   After feeling extremely uncomfortable I finally decided to leave the Island as I didn't feel comfortable being around him. When I was leaving I saw another couple who had been forced into the room above me, another room I was offered.   Alex did not apologise for any of this and instead had to think about giving me my money back. Alex asked me to leave as soon as possible so he would not lose money on the room. His behaviour was horrendous. Don't waste your time spending money on a hotel that is going to make as much money out of you as possible, you could easily risk being pushed out of the hotel and into an ""apartment"" on the streets.",30,623
…,40,623
So close you can hear the party from the nearby strip so this has pros and cons of course. The a/c just about kept us cool... not sure if it was working well. Bonus TV and DVD player and nice big bed. Poor shower stream and not the nicest bathroom. Got a brilliant trip to see the whale sharks through the manager at $70 pp. Got good recommendation for local launderette too.,20,623
The location is really great! 2 streets away from all restaurants and shops. Playa Norte (the sunset is AMAZING) is less than 5 minutes away or 1 minute away with a golf cart. I really enjoyed my one night stay at Casa Naranja. Might be noisy for people older people but at the end of the day I will recommand this place. ,30,623
"We had a room at the back but we were the whole night really bothered by the noise on the street. If you want a restful sleep choose something else. So we wanted to move as quickly as possible and fortunately the owner did not fuss about it. Well we had lost the 15% that goes to Hostelworld. On the Internet I did not find affordable accommodation but when we were there, there were plenty of cheap hotels.",40,623
"Stayed here for four nights with my husband. We are backpacking so not forward planning and this was the only place available by the time we booked, maybe that should have told us something?  It was ok, but for the price really not good value for money. In 5 months this is the most expensive room we've stayed in and although by no means the worst a long way from the best. The room was clean but it was very dark & dingy, the bathroom smelled strongly of drains every morning (this smell cleared throughout the day) and it is noisy from the street right outside all day and with music playing until 2am.  Plus points there is a kitchen so you can do your own breakfast & cook and a fridge in every room which is nice to be able to chill drinks etc. However all in all if you're more",50,623
"Last time I was on IM we stopped in and looked at the rooms and thought it would be a nice cheap place to stay. I had booked a trip and wired in 1 nights deposit. Ended up having to cancel at the last minute, e-mailed the hotel and assumed my deposit was forfeit. Received a nice e-mail back and was told they would hold my deposit for our next trip.",50,624
This hotel was cheap and very central. We found our room to be a good size but dingy and in desperate need of painting. The bed was well used and lacking in comfort. The bathroom was a good size and had plenty of hot water. The passageways had cleaning brooms and mops piled in corners and gave an un-kept look to the hotel. The central walls had large patches of black mould on them where water dripped. The central garden vegetation was sparse and the area was often used to store garbage before being disposed of. The staff were friendly. We moved to another hotel with similar pricing and much more pleasant surroundings.,10,624
"This is a great, centrally based hotel with welcoming and obliging staff. It's no frills, but quite adequate and above all, clean.  However, we had a bad experience with the Tours and Info Bureau attached to the hotel.   The day before we were due to leave we purchased a pre-paid taxi from Pt. Jaurez to Cancun airport. Unfortunately, the taxi never arrived and we had no means of contacting the agent  (despite having a receipt, there was no telephone contact number). We were forced to take another taxi to the airport ($35).  We don't recommend buying a pre-paid taxi because there are plenty of fixed rate taxis to be hired at Pt. Juarez.",30,624
"Wonderful place to stay, my room was clean, had cable tv (saw a lot of Big  Bang Theory!), plenty of hot water, very good location and very inexpensive.  Lupita, the young assistant, was very friendly and welcoming, though her English is limited.  I asked for blanket, as it was cold at night, didn't need fan, and she was very obliging.  If you need extra towels, soap or anything to be comfortable, just ask!!  The place is a block to some wonderful beach areas at the very end of Playa Norte, fronting several hotels, i.e. Cabanas del Mar, Buhio restaurant.  You don't need to rent beach chairs or umbrellas if you only want to spread your beach towel.  The beach in front of Jax restaurant is very good, too.  Lots of places to eat, Alexia & Giovanny by the marketplace, very good",40,624
" chilaquilles, La Cazuela for breakfast eggs, Aluxes cafe for house coffee with warm milk, you can buy fresh baked bread at Super Express grocery to drink with your coffee, rotisserie chicken across from the hotel for inexpensive lunch, the ""cart"" across the street and next to the cemetery for tacos, Sesso Locos and El Bruja in the colonias for some good local eats, Rene and Renee for inexpensive local comida.  Also, look for lady selling tamale by the main beach, the lady selling empanadas and flan near the church, the ""marquesitas"" truck again by the main beach, and the fresh orange juice cart on Madero, and Tino the rib man on Sundays across from the PADI dive shop, again on Madero.  I will be back, this island has lots to offer in terms of simple pleasures and good eats!!!  Very easy to get from Cancun airport by taking public ADO bus outside the terminal, around $3.15 (40 pesos) for 25 minute ride to central downtown Cancun, then there is a collectivo for $.45, outside of main terminal, go to the right, and look for big McDonald sign, take collectivo marked ""Gran Puerto"", about 10 minutes, and it will drop you off right in front of Ultramar ferry. Ferry ride is 15 minutes and cost 70 pesos, make sure you buy ticket one way as they will sell you ticket round trip.  As soon as you get off ferry, walk to left, and go to end of the malecon, Jax restaurant will be in front of you, cross the street, walk two more blocks, turn right on Hidalgo, and you will find Xul-ha, right in front of XS Hostel.  Hidalgo is pedestrian main street for tons of restaurants and shops.  Oh, by the way, the massage offered  in front of the beach is only USD $35 for one hour.  Enjoy!!!",30,624

"This hotel is on a main street, across the narrow road from a few bars, so it get very loud at closing time.  I was very glad I brought earplugs.  We paid extra for an air-conditioned room, but they didn't give us the remote for the air conditioning until the 3rd or 4th day.  There was no shower curtain or towels (again, the towels came a day or two later than we did), and the beds were small and hard (two people in one bed is crowded).  The staff was very friendly, though, and always smiling.  We got our room for 400 pesos/night, which is cheap, and if you're looking to be frugal, this place is what you're after.  If I go to Isla again, I will gladly pay extra to stay in the sea-side hotels, as they are out-of-the-way enough not to be noisy at night, and they are bound to be",40,624
 more comfortable.,40,624
"We liked this place alot. The staff are very nice and friendly and they look after the hotel well with high care and standards. Perfect wifi, nice balcony bit, good location. The price is the best we could find on the island. Don't book ahead on Mujeres, just come have a look round yourself, you'll get a better budget deal. Also, the rooms are so cool on the third floor, we didn't even need the fan on much! ",50,625
"I've stayed in several small pension-type accommodations on Isla Mujeres and around the Yucatan, Osorio is by far my favourite - I will never look to stay anywhere else when I visit Mujeres in the future!  The rooms are very basic and pretty dated, but so are many in Mexico, but they are large, with a large shower, an effective ceiling fan, large windows for light and air and plenty of room to move.  Housekeeping are great.  Location is great, easy walk to the port, Hildago (shops, restaurants)  - everything is within a short walk.  You have to book by phone, you have to pay by cash,  they don't really speak english, the rooms are possibly the best value on the island.  Visit beautiful Isla Mujeres, stay at Osorio - enjoy your holiday!",40,625
"Attention: No A/C, put your toilet waste in a plastic bag, no TV........You're in the real Mexico, hombres!   Love this place......I always stay on the 3rd floor.  Nice breeze.  The maids keep the place nice and clean.  Tile floors.  Basic single bed. Simple and very inexpensive ($20-ish).   Close to the ferry so you can walk there.  In Centro.....everything is close.  Juice stand on the street in the morning.   Five-star Simplicity!   You'll need your Spanish too, my friends.",40,625
"This hotel is very basic.  No television or air conditioning or telephone or internet.  It is a bit run down and could use some paint and maintenance.   It has a ceiling fan.   However, for only about $25 per night it is a good deal.  It is clean and in a good location just three blocks from the ferry dock.  I would stay here again.",30,625
"I read about this hotel on tripadvisor and thought it would be good value. No website, just a phone so I called and used my booked a room for 300 peso/night, about $24 tax included. Not sure if there was tax, when I checked in all I did was give the young girl cleaning the rooms 600 pesos for two nights. Should have asked for a receipt to prove I paid for 2 nights but there was no problem.   An easy walk from the pier, maybe 2 blocks at most. Central location so quick walk to most places, maybe 4 blocks to the beach. Lots of small shops and restaurants all over the place. I recommend the cocina economicas, small restaurants where the locals eat. Had some great tasty meals for about 60 pesos. Small laundry about a block away, did my laundry in two hours for 60 pesos. Liquor store",30,625
" right across the street, any time I got thirsty I stopped by and bought a beer for 13 pesos.   Took a room on the 3rd floor. No air conditioning, just a ceiling fan. Daytime temps were around 28 celcius so hot evenings weren't a problem. Although the room was clean it was a little dated with faded paint and paint chips in the wall. Electrical switches and outlets were about 50 years old. Shower head was rusted, there was warm water, mirror was faded and tough to see my reflection when shaving. No safe in the room.  Relatively quiet at night although you could still hear street noise. Mornings were noisy, I think another poster mentioned the rooster, sure enough it started crowing at sunrise, luckily I turned in early both nights so getting up early wasn't a problem. Didn't see any bugs in the room and no mosquitoes despite no glass in the windows, just wooden louvres.    Anyway, I recommend this hotel for the value and the fact that I enjoy basic accommodations as long as they are clean.",30,625

"I stayed at Hotel Osorio for 4 nights, it is situated very close in walking distance to the ferry harbor and also to the main street of Isla Mujeres.   There are two types of rooms available, with or without AC. As the hotel was almost fully booked and I didn't place a reservation beforehand the only choice I got was a double room without AC but with a ceiling fan, which was 300 Pesos per night. The room was situated on the floor above the reception. It is very spacious, not very clean but not dirty either at an average hostel level I would say. The beds and linen were clean, the mattresses have seen better days, no real comfort here.   As the room had no real glass windows and not a mosquito net on everyone of them, I've been attacked by some of them during night. The hotel is",50,625
" close to the main street so you might hear some noise from (most likely) drunken people passing by. One night I was seriously bothered by a group of guests from the hotel who came home around 5 o'clock in the morning and kept partying in front of their rooms. The following nights there were no disturbances whatsoever..  Overall I think it is a good budget place to stay, especially for backpackers. If you plan to be outside most of the time and don't expect a cozy hotel but more of a hostel it will be alright!",30,625

Neomi was great at ensuring we had a clean room with everything we needed. She was very friendly and gave great recommendations for local restaurants.  If you are able to visit Mininos, I HIGHLY recommend it... absolutely worth the golf cart trip.  Overall the Mia hotel checked all the boxes... Relaxing location Breathtaking views Plenty of activities for the entire family  Good, clean food Spacious and clean accommodations",50,965

"Isla Mujeres is a beautiful beach, with almost perfect views, the atmosphere is excellent to rest and get out of the routine.  It is a place that you can visit with your family and the costs are affordable.  One of the best beaches in Mexico",30,627

However , when we arrived at the airport , we were taken to a ferry where we waited over two hours to go to the hotel . Upon arrival , we were told our room wasn’t ready , but the hotel was going to upgrade us free of charge . The first day we noticed a charge on the credit card for 620.00  and immediately called the front desk . The front desk said it was a mistake and that it would be credited back .

The hotel sent a receipt after 6 months to the credit card company showing we signed for the charges for the room upgrade . The only problem is that the date is wrong , all three signatures they supplied don’t match , and the room number is wrong . The Palace Resorts have yet to refund our money back .  Th ey should refund the money back and apologize . We already had paid a fortune for the vacation and may have used their other Palace  resorts in the future . Had they not done this . They should apologize and refund the money . We have filed to have the charge remove from the card . IMP refused to do so and had since gone under . Palace resorts should do the right thing and refund our money back . If a mistake was made OK . Apologize and refund the money back . If not , it looks really bad in the Palace resorts to do such a thing . This needs immediate attention",50,627

"Once again another tremendous Palace experience. It is what we have come to expect from Palace and they have again made our vacation a memory for a lifetime.  Although they consistently provide excellent food and beverage, clean comfortable facilities and lots of available activities, it is the staff and the service they provide that truly make the difference for us. Our DC Fermin did an incredible job tending to our needs and planned a beautiful special dinner for us under the palapa on the pier as we enjoyed the spectacular evening sunset receiving unbelievable service from our waiter Juan Silver and a delectable 4 course meal from the head chef Renado. Every morning the day got off to a great start with breakfast being served and delivered by the dedicated team of Macedonio,",40,627
" Juan, Christian, Martin & Paola. If you cannot laugh around this crew you seriously do need a vacation. We enjoyed several spa experiences from massages to manicures & pedicures all at the amazing talents of Natividad & Carmen who provided a tranquil setting to display their skilful abilities. Palace should be proud of the wonderful team they have put together at Isla Mujeres Palace. As this particular resort has been sold effective April 1st, we would like to extend our best wishes and continued success to not only the staff in their new positions within other Palace resorts but also to those who will be leaving the company to explore other opportunities on the island. You have made our last trip to Isla Mujeres Palace a truly memorable one.",50,627

"Having experienced a number of organised trips in Mexico, I knew to expect some level of shortfall on delivered service. Overselling is pretty much the norm here.   Decided last minute to book a catamaran trip to the Isla Mujeres.   For those who snorkelled, Great experience and really well managed by boat crew.   The island is what you would expect two stops, one at a market that would suit people that want to barter and get a deal for local trinkets. Frankly the prices quoted were 4 or 5 times what you would expect to pay. I like a barter but chose to walk off and not buy anything.   Next stop beach and food, lovely beach, ample supply of deck chairs. Usual sales pitch with almost anything you want outside of package really expensive. Wished I paid the $45 upgrade. Food wasn’t",30,628
" to my taste.   Wasn’t that impressed with the ad hoc swim with shark attraction, advert in how not to look after wildlife.   Trip back was uneventful with a nice breeze, great for topping up tan.   The end of this trip was a debacle with boat crew more interested in securing their tips, they were great to be fair and earned them, than telling us how to find our taxi back to resort. One tour guide was trying to help dealing with around 300 passengers most of which walked past the meeting point for taxis, which was situated before the toilets. The boat had limited toilet facilities and they served drinks to 100 people all day.   Finally having met up with the mini cab driver he marched us several hundred yards, across major road to his van. Then proceeded to drive close to 20km in the opposite direction to the hotels.   Misses on this trip as advertised, adult only and 50 people, reality 100 people and children on board, Return journey under sail never happened. Over 90 minutes in both island locations, 40 minutes in town and more time on beach . Back at resort for 5:30PM, over 90 minutes late, held up at sea for around 20 minutes and then 90 minutes from end of trip to hotel.   Very much a case of thanks for your money, you are now not important to us.   Recommend paying for the upgrade and book through your tour operator. We used a reputable hotel based tour company, awaiting their reply on our complaint.   Just been asked to write a report, expected better from people we contracted with. Their supplier issues are not my problem.   The positives balance out the negatives, sea, sand, good crew, nice location and wildlife. Would do this again, maybe without the poor service at end of experience.   ",50,628

"if you want to get a genuin adventure, take a look at the tshirt on the picture and contact them, the have a little wooden boat, not so nice but they are fantastic people. You go snorkling among fishes you only see in an aquarium... They are polite and speak some english. if you are brave enough to get out of the box on your vacation..?price is good too!",50,628
One of the most beautiful beaches that I have ever been to. In my opinion better than the Maldives.  The north end of the island you can walk out 80 meters and still only be thigh deep.the beach bar at this beach was very good value for money and the food was nice.best way to travel the island is by hiring a golf cart.the ferry crossing from cancun to here was 19 us dollars. Well worth a visit.,50,628
"The Marina here is very tranquil and lined with beautiful vessels anchored from everywhere in the world.  Docked here in front of the Isla Mujeres Yacht Club & World Mark Resort is the Famous ""Boardwalk"" Yacht .  What an incredible luxurious vessel to view from our room!",30,628
Awesome journey filled with scuba diving and awesome people great food relaxing four hour  cruise. Crew members were funny and entertaining highly recommend this for the next trip. The next trip with the all the extra activities we couldn't of asked for anything else ,40,628
The ferry ride was very relaxing and fast. Some restaurants were clean some others not so much. It's pretty chill there. The beach is nice. Ppl are nice. Not much to do. Just walk or rent a gold cart to get around. It's busy so be prepared to see a lot of people walking around. The weather was nice mid 70's-80's a bit windy but very nice. I recommend to bring (pesos) way cheaper that way. ,40,628
"Helpful, friendly staff.  Clean well kept facilities. Beautiful grounds. Highly recommend.  Close to shopping, and beaches. Staff speak English and you will find English widely spoken in Isla. Wonderful restaurants, reasonably priced.",50,628
"The location of this hotel on isla mujeres cannot be beat. The rooms are nice sized and clean, with private balconies. Cleaning staff did an excellent job every day. The decor is minimal, perhaps not the bohemian vibe that some travelers look for. But we loved it and are going back again over Easter",50,629
"Very nice place to stay. Very quiet at night, not sure about during the day, wasn’t in room much during the day. Excellent location, right on the beach, close to everything. Very clean throughout the resort. Beach bathroom very clean every time I used it. Plenty of loungers and good service to help you set up for the day. Food service on beach was good as was the food. Plenty of other places near by to eat if you want to change it up. Very close to Hildalgo  street for shopping and restaurants and entertainment. Of note you need to ask for room service each day, which we did. Service was pleasantly provided. Beds comfortable!!! Sadly the beach has become much smaller since I was here last year. It seemed busier as well.",50,629
"we just returned from another lovely stay at Playa Arena.......and returned happy again... there are lots of small and lovely touches like filtered water, fresh coffee set ups, and wine glasses.... appreciate the great hot water and the super clean rooms.... we will be back!",50,629
Great spot to stay. Traveled the area a lot and by far the coldest room ever. Free breakfast is a nice add. Good location to all of north beach and nice staff. Clean rooms and nice grounds. Only drawback is a very small pool that’s upstairs. Very small like a plunge pool. Other than that top notch.,50,629
"Great experience at Playa Arena overall. Stayed 3 nights following a stay at Nautibeach next door so we were able to experience both accommodation types in one of the mist beautiful beaches in Mexico. To summarize here are the pros and cons per our experience:  Pros: Clean, allowed early check in, steps away from the beach, complimentary breakfast, tropical property ambiance, affordable price, helpful beach bar staff  Cons: Poor staff follow up to room issue (had us wait and never returned to room to inform us of status resolving our problem), odd room smell  As you can see the good outweighed the bad and we will definitely return in the future. Hoping the lack of customer service was a one off occurrence because everything else was great.",40,629
"My family of 4 (two 15 year old boys) rented Marino Pescador 1 for the twins and Mi Secreta 2 for myself and my husband.    The accommodations at Playa Arena are good, but don't be expecting anything fancy, y'all. What this place delivers on is AMAZING BEACHFRONT ACCESS and small resort charm.  I feel badly ranking them a ""4"" because they have such a strong 4.5, but the resort has some flaws.  Pros: Mi Secreta is not just beachfront - it is ON THE BEACH. Check out the photos below to see what I am talking about.   Luis set up front row chairs and umbrellas every day for me early in the morning with a smile for me to drink my coffee and watch the ocean.  I never saw that breakfast was included with the rental, but it IS and it is a really good breakfast!  Great coffee, fruit,",40,629
" eggs, bacon, potatoes, pancakes. We enjoyed getting to see Valenten, Valentino and the Alejandros each day.   We also enjoyed the resort kitties (Pintira and her sister.) Beds and pillows are decent.  AC is strong and cold!   The lunch we had there was also very good.  Drinks are reasonable priced.   Marino Pescador 1 was larger than Mi Secreta and had better kitchen outfitting. The pool is very small and a little awkward to visit as it's on another room's patio, but we visited it almost every day and it was clean and cool and refreshing with a great view!    CONS:  In Mi Secreta 2 in the bathroom, there is a malfunctioning window into the wait station and it gets loud.  Closing both heavy doors from the bathroom into the bedroom was adequate. The bathroom overall was iffy - the water lightly smelled of sewage on occasion (and therefore, my hair did, too), there was inadequate hot water to come anywhere close filling the tub or to take a long shower.  But it's an island, guys... There were small ants in the bathroom regularly.   Beach drink service was slow and we had to get drinks ourselves a lot.    No housekeeping due to COVID (but we asked for housekeeping once and she did excellent!). Overall, we enjoyed our stay and totally recommend the resort, but it just wasn't 5 stars.",50,629

"I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of April. This is a small hotel tucked in between Nautibeach and Ixchel directly on Playa Norte. It's hidden under palm trees so there is a lot of shade. I stayed in La Carta room #2 above the lobby. It was a small room, with shower and balcony. It had a microwave, mini fridge/freezer, toaster, coffee maker, and large bottle of water. The air conditioner has a remote control so you can adjust the temp yourself! The only negatives on this room were that the bed and pillows were hard, and the wifi in the evenings was really slow. My music would keep buffering which was annoying. Everything else was great. Jesus and the young lady at the front desk were very helpful and patient with me and any questions I had.   Beach towels, and breakfast are",50,629
" included. Let the front desk know if you need new towels or your room cleaned. The breakfast was excellent. You could have eggs, beans, potatoes, toast, coffee, pancakes, fruit etc, with the most breathtaking view.Valentin will take excellent care of you at the restaurant/bar/beach. Staying here gives you access to lounge chairs, umbrella, and table with fantastic beach service from Alejandro and Valentin. This is my favorite part of the beach since the chairs are not so bunched up together. You can rent a golf cart through the hotel for about 1100 pesos per 24 hours, but I rented from Luxury right at the entrance for 1200. They have great, FAST carts. This place was super and I've already booked for August. Contact the hotel and they may have a deal for you. They are now only booking through their website. Email response is very fast. Best beach, fantastic service, and close to everything. I've stayed at Privilege Aluxes 3 times, Nautibeach, and Ixchel. This part of the beach is my favorite!",50,629

There was always someone around willing to help out/bring anything you need. Donovan, the general manager, went absolutely out of his way to ensure our stay was perfect. Cannot say enough amazing things about this hotel and can't wait to return back soon!",50,630
"The location was absolutely beautiful and the hotel itself was very clean. I would say that overall the best thing was the staff. The concierge, Donovan, went above and beyond, he is so friendly and helpful. He made the experience that much better for me and my friends. The rest of the staff was so great as well, there was always someone to help when we needed it whether that meant booking an excursion or recommending a restaurant.  I couldn't recommend this place more! I will definitely be going back.",50,630
"If you’re looking for a top notch place to stay- look no further. Close to all the main attractions, you get the best of both worlds with upbeat attractions and the quietness to enjoy. From everything to the Staff, location, amenities, location you are getting nothing short of an A+ experience. Thank you to Donovan for the great help and customer service. We will be back again!

"If I could give more stars to this resort, I would.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were met with genuine, kind, attentive (but not fawning or overwhelming) staff.  The concierge,  Donovan, was just a great guy who is very experienced but also with a genuine sense of humor that put us at ease immediately. I noticed the constant, thorough attention the staff paid to keeping the pool area pristine all day.  They made a very strong, consistent effort at keeping the algea (build up due to global warming) controlled on the beachfront.  I loved the EXCELLENT yoga instructor they had every morning. The restaurant was also amazing and reasonably priced.  I will most definitively be back to THIS place. ",50,630
"Great hotel, friendly and attentive staff. Food and drinks were good. Consierge Donovan was very helpful and helped us book an excursion to Chichén Itzá which was awesome. The pool was great since the beach was all covered with seaweed. Would definitely stay at Maria del Mar again. ",50,630

"I’m typically very generous with 5 star ratings if I’ve had a pleasant experience and this was indeed very pleasant but I can’t go higher than 4 stars as it wasn’t “prestine” all around which I expected considering the price.  We had booked one of the pricier options for roughly 550 USD a night and at such a price I expect everything to be otherworldly, maybe that’s unfair so read my review in that light.   The pros: * gorgeous view - I mean just look at the photo. * great room - excellent indeed except for maybe the water pressure but haven travelled extensively in this region of the world that is to be expected from time to time * outdoor area is great and inviting in its atmosphere * access to good restaurant options and epic ocean views  The cons:  * the hotel and attached",40,630
" restaurant collaborate but with only 16-20ish rooms you expect peace and quiet but instead the hotel/pool/outside area can some days be “invaded” by  guests from outside the hotel who buy a single beer and then establish their own party right next to you when all you want is to enjoy the nature and relax. Considering the price per night, I’d expect the hotel/restaurant to keep that as the main priority. We saw this on more than one of the days and that is a major “con” for me given the purpose I had with my stay.  * staff was generally very pleasant, really no doubt, but from time to time the organization wasn’t on point with e.g cleaning removing towels and forgetting to bring new ones, the hotel registering that we had consumed items from the minibar when we hadn’t (we weren’t charged and they swiftly retreated of course trusting us), offering a tour in their welcoming email but then not being able to recognize the offering when requested upon arrival (however trying to help find another). As such, no complaints or unpleasantries, but for a highly ranked hotel and with the price point in mind I expect better.  All in all a very enjoyable stay in amazing surrounding but with room for improvement.",10,630

Stayed with two other families in March 2022. The location is great off the main noisiest part of Tulum beach but close enough to walk to the shops and restaurants. Beach area is great with many shaded areas. But the staff is what makes this place great. Carlos and Franco at the restaurant are great. The owner is on site and makes sure everything runs properly.  Would definitely return .,50,631
"The loud music every day is ANNOYING. It’s just too Loud!! Boom boom! Why does it have to be that loud? Not to mention your choice sucks. Sorry… just sayin…so you nope, guests staying at neighboring properties want to hear the ocean. Clubs like this are what are ruining the tranquility of Tulum.",10,631

The beach was free of sargassum and maintained daily. Front desk and restaurant service was excellent and the included breakfast was delicious. One of the best ceviches, guacamole and mixology. Location is ideal, walkable to restaurants.",50,631

Everyone at the front desk is lovely and responded to our needs quickly. The turndown service was really nice and we especially loved the chocolate trays waiting for us when we returned from dinner.

Upon arrival, the reception team felt like they knew us already and we’re prepared  with taxis for the next day. Jared and another kind young man. We called them season 1. Team. The best. The hotel was very in theme with tulum. Rustic idyllic pretty lagoon  pool. FRANCO (my fave: sweet, chatty and thoughtful ) and Carlos at the restaurant charming young men! Fresh fruit, baskets of sweet breads, eggs ordered to your liking all overlooking the ocean ( algae and seaweed but that’s on me I didn’t research the conditions during this time) .",50,631
" Overall Very serviceable.   We had some issues with the A/C but once we told them (the 2nd crew ~nice young man with a beard) they took care of it. The shower flooded a bit but once we told them they resolved it. It was as simple as moving the black rocks decorating the drain to fix it.  cleaning crew- nice replenished towels etc.  Everyone went out of their way, minus one lady, that I would say really made the stay an amazing one.   Even with the A/C and the shower (which could happen anywhere it’s how they handle it )  I would recommend because it’s TULUM and you are paying for being one with nature  and  the jungle. I loved that it only had 12 villas. Very boutique feel. The sound of ocean at your doorstep was priceless!",10,631

"$450 a night for a hotel with a giant cockroach in the bathroom and a beach that’s covered in seaweed. The cockroach is not a jungle pest that should be tolerated. It means the pipes under the sink aren’t sealed so it allows bugs in the room. The pillows are also pretty cheap for a hotel this expensive. All that plus every restaurant in the area seems like $200 for two to have dinner. Not for me thanks.  I’m never coming back. I have asked to leave the hotel and they will not refund me for the remainder of my stay. So I guess I’m now here against my will or I lose out on $2,000+.

We planned a trip with some friends to stay at this resort and decided to cancel months ago at the height of the omicron variant when cases were very high.

It’s a little off from the party/clubby beach clubs which we liked because we could generally relax and have a beach day. The staff and service was great and the food was even better. They have one of the lower minimums of guests, which is easily met with a drink and a meal. By far the best pina colada I’ve ever had!",50,632

"I have been to Maya Tulum twice, though I must admit it's the only resort in Tulum I've been to. But why mess with perfection? We stayed at beach-side palapas both times, they accommodated us with 3 beds the 2nd time. On the beach is farther from the road so quieter. Rooms are clean, enough hot/warm water in showers, food is delish, fresh and plenty, and love that ginger tea always available. Spa treatments are great, excursions fun & safe, great guides. Rooms are good size, separate toilet area, shower some have bathtubs, nets over the beds, few chairs & small table, large water dispenser of purified water for drinking & brushing teeth refilled every day. Decent wifi in the restaurant, and clean beach, nice lounge chairs, and the staff are all so nice, helpful, friendly. They",50,633
" even bought feminine products for a guest to save them the taxi ride! Yoga classes are very good, like the variety of teachers. We even had a movie night in the yoga room.  We were there in November 2015 and January 2019. They used to provide airport transport, but not the 2nd time. They arranged it for us but was more expensive than if we booked ourselves. The 2nd time we were there for birthdays, and the head chef made me a small cake & hugs, so lovely. Up the road is the area with some shops a quick walk. A great getaway to unwind.",10,633

"With a friend we stayed in Mayatulum hotel for a weekend of July 20-22. The sea was very clean, no seaweed at all, we spent hours swimming. The beach is private. At night turtles come to lay their eggs, the hotel protects the nests until the babies hatch, Cabanas are top notch, comfortable, air conditioned, clean, enough space. We had ocean front and it was amazing to hear the waves and have a panoramic sea view. The manager, Barbara Vargas, was so welcoming, nice and helpful. She helped with all our requests, she greeted us at our arrival and was there to say goodbye when we were leaving. We only stayed 2 nights, but returned as if we had a 10 day vacation. We even saw a turtle one early morning, on her way back to the sea. Highly recommended.",10,633
"It was our first time in tulum, we came across pocna whilst strolling along the beach, we hired a day bed staying the majority of the day. The staff were attentive and the served us drinks all day, we also had a gorgeous lunch - the beef tacos were amazing!!! Highly recommended",50,634
"PocNa was our home for almost two weeks. We loved our stay here. It’s the perfect mix of jungle vibe and beach chill. The rooms are light, clean and beautifully decorated with Mexican details. The best part of our stay was the wonderful staff that have a great attentive and personal energy that made us feel special and at home. We will miss you! Every morning I enjoyed a super nice yoga class with talented Allix Yoga on the deck with view over the ocean. I also joined a great breathwork session during our stay. PocNa is situated on the peaceful part of the Tulum beach (so not the party area) which was perfect for us. We were traveling with our baby of 7 months. The hotel’s restaurants on the beach are great.  We hope to visit PocNa again in the future.",50,634
"Just returned from a 5 night stay at this property and this property is outstanding overall.    First, the staff is fantastic.  We had a family emergency come up during our stay and the staff was so incredibly kind and warm to us.   Whatever we needed during our stay, they provided.  It's also REALLY nice to see such a great security presence, both at the beach club and entering the parking area.  Some nice amenities around, including a comfortable beach club, restaurant and a shaded ""common"" area of a building where you could sit and use their wifi.   Free parking (24/7 security, as well) if you drive in.  Free breakfast was a nice way to start the day. You have a limited (maybe 7) selection, but they were all very good and you could order other stuff for an additional fee. ",50,634
" Rooms were comfortable.  Bed was firmer than most, but still comfortable.  Pillows were good. Views were outstanding.  The plunge pool was more of a plunge bathtub size, but still very nice. Hammocks and outdoor seating were provided and very well utilized.  They also have in room coffee makers.    NO in-room Wifi.  AC in the rooms is VERY nice, especially in the hotter months.  Only downsides to this resort are: Lack of wi-fi in the rooms and the rather pricey food  and drinks at their restaurants.  Our last day, 2 mojitos and a coke was almost $25USD!  Also, they is ALWAYS music playing at the beach club.  Sometimes it would just be nice to sit and relax without the music playing.  They do have cool activities for their guests depending on certain days.  We did an inversion therapy and ice bath.  They also offer Yoga and some other activities depending on the day.  Overall, we would absolutely be back and stay at this hotel.",50,634

My boyfriend and I actually extended our stay due to the amazing hospitality, dream like location and calm vibes Pocna offers. The rooms were tastefully decorated in rustic style and included a Keurig machine, a beach bag with towels was thoughtfully provided, and safe. We had 5 options for breakfast, Mexican and international, which you have at Ramon's facing the sea every morning. No one was pushy with tips or trying to sell us tours (which all seasoned travelers know can ruin a vacation). In fact after an unfortunate police encounter $$ (which is common in Mexico as the sun rising), they helped my Canadian boyfriend laugh it off and offered next steps should it happen again.",50,634

"We stayed in Villa H2O for 4 nights in march 2021.  The property is located near the jungle side of Tulum which is more laid back. The property has onsite free parking and a very nice swimming pool. There are not many rooms in the hotel (maybe 10maximum) which makes the swimming pool highly available for yourself and the hotel is not noisy at all which is perfect for relaxing.  The rooms are amazing, spacious, and offer all needed amenities (balcony/terrace, view, best toileteries, beach towels).  The staff is very helpful and available 24H.  The breakfast is open from 8 to 10:30am and offers limited choice but the food is good quality.

"What a quaint and quiet boutique hotel.  Our room was very clean, a/c worked great and we never ran out of hot water.   We had a small fridge, no TV and great wifi for emails.  Just what was needed.    The whole place is surrounded by a concrete wall that’s about 10’ tall and has two wooden doors that are locked at night.  We walked to the corner store for water, beer and snacks, which was nice and convenient.    Fermina whipped up a great breakfast each morning and her cucumber/pear juice should be bottled and sold in stores.  Mariana is a top notch hostess, who helped arrange cabs, made dinner reservations in town and gave us great ideas for excursions...which she also helped facilitate.    Quiet.  Slow paced.  Secure.  Tranquil.    We are planning our next visit as I type.  ",50,635

The staff was amazing and went above and beyond to accommodate my friends and I. Mariana was the best host we could have ever asked for and made sure we were taken care of! She would call taxis for us and even planned some of our daily/tour activities. She was truly the best!! We had the penthouse which was spacious, included a kitchen with a fridge, super clean, and the view outside the balcony of the pool was stunning. The location was great, it was in walking distance from local shops and was not noisy. It is also is not far (25min drive) to the busy night life area. I would absolutely recommend and will definitely be back for any future trips.",50,635
"We loved our stay at Villas H2O.  This was our first time Tun Tulum but we were shocked that the hotel zone was so chaotic and packed - maybe a factor fo a COVID and all of the influencers and digital nomads being there - but regardless, we were glad to be in a quiet hotel a little bit apart from the hustle and bustle.  The rooms are minimalist and lovely, with excellent AC, fans, and screened doors to keep cool.  The beds were comfortable and shampoo/ soaps high end.  The room was dark and silent at night.  Showers amazing with great hot water and pressure.  The front desk was helpful and check in and check out quick.  The pool is gorgeous.

The did reserve this close seating area for guests but wasn’t an issue as lots of other seating options.   Food was nice in the restaurant, decor was stylish. We were told we had to have a minimum consumption spend of $100 USD per person but actually wasn’t required once you were in",40,636

They helped with our queries - adapters, book exchange and restaurant recommendations - and really go the extra mile to make you feel at home. Breakfast staff always had a smile greeting us. - the rooms are perfect - it is a tent and the shower and toilet facilities are outside but it is all part of the habitas experience. Everything in the room was stylish and was all we needed including the complimentary fruit, water, robes and the luxury body lotion/wash which smelt incredible (be aware that raccoons can go on the tent roof throughout the night and make some noise - to be expected in the jungle environment but ear phones were handy for this. Otherwise dead quiet throughout",50,636
" the night) - pool area was clean, towels available everyday and was never too busy to get a sun bed. The area was perfect for relaxing and was not over crowded being the main pro here. The beach had a lot of seaweed but this was everywhere in tulum. There were workers clearing the seaweed everyday. The sea was nice enough to swim in although the pool area is so nice most people stay around there. The lounging areas/ hammocks in the shade are great too. -food was great - no complaints. Great menu and selection. Great smoothies and breakfast. Bit pricey but again, same as everywhere in Tulum. - hotel activities were incredible. A variety of classes which we had never done before. We were shocked these were free as they would be expensive back home in London. Great teachers of the class and really helped us relax. The team text you every night to let you know what’s on the next day. We had never done yoga (or any of the classes they offer) before but we thoroughly enjoyed them. -Location is great - it’s not in the centre of the hustle and bustle of tulum beach but it’s close enough to get to the restaurants and bars.   Overall would 100% recommend if you want to stay in a unique hotel and really experience the tulum vibe.",50,636

"My husband and I stumbled upon Habitas when searching for a beautiful hotel with good reviews in Tulum and wow, we were so pleased. The entire stay is truly an experience, starting from the greeting and welcome - you are emerged in a quiet jungle, on the beach with wellness as a top priority. The restaurant, Moro, has incredible and fresh meals, elixirs, and beverages. At first, we were bummed that Habitas is about a 5-10 minute cab ride from the heart of Tulum beach, but honestly after spending a day down in the craziness of the party that is Tulum Beach, we were thankful and ready to get back to our oasis of Habitas. We booked the ocean view room and watching every sunrise over the ocean and falling asleep to the ocean waves was surreal. The outdoor bathrooms and showers were",50,636

Loved the activities on offer which once can partake or not. No pressure. Good mix of clientele and restaurant serves the most delicious food.",50,636
"Habitas is a truly special place. Quality food, service, rooms & everything. Blooming brilliant find. Loved the sandy walkway through the jungle to arrive in the communal spaces. Showing with the the sunshine, or moonlight was unforgettable. And watching sunrise from the balcony over the ocean, or from our bed was special as heck. We'd love to go back. ",50,636
"I stayed an entire week at Habitas, as a solo traveler looking to unwind, get closer to myself, but also to be in a place where I would have the opportunity to meet some others.   This is an incredible hotel. I notice some negative reviews here from people who showed up for dinner only - I was here a full week. There is yoga every morning, and a really good sound therapy which you must try, and generally some sort of rotating / mindfulness thing in the evening. All were great.   The thing I liked about it the most is the effort they go to to make it easier to meet other folks staying at the hotel. Daily mezcal tasting is a nice touch, and all the serving staff are super friendly and will remember your name and get chatting with you.   I was originally going to stay for only a",30,636

It’s in the hotel zone, but the hotel itself doesn’t have a club in it, so it was like the best of both worlds. We enjoyed being able to go hang out in the party restaurants and come back to a quiet hotel.

Now, I can attest the experience at Delek was as enjoyable as any Ritz or Four Seasons. It’s important to understand that at Tulum, you’re here to relax, eat good Mexican food, enjoy the beach, and party at clubs. The only reason Delek is not rated higher is because they don’t have their own pool, gym, etc. However, Delek is centrally located to everything. The rooms are gems with own ocean warm breezy patios. The beach is super relaxing, and literally right next door to famous Jungle Gym, Bagatelle Pool Beach Club, Mia Pool Beach Club, etc. So we got all the workouts we wanted, were able to party",50,637

The head of security, Eli, literally cleaned our wounds by hand. Thalia coordinated doctor, taxi, hospital visit… and made sure we as American tourists didn’t get ripped off by contacting everyone ahead of time by herself. I am speechless on how important we felt.

Our room was a hut that was spectacularly decorated and had an outside shower. As beautiful as the hotel is the best part about it is the staff. They are young and beautiful but so great at their job. They knew our names the whole time and made every thing run smoothly. They even negotiated the cab price before we got in.  Breakfast on the front deck looking at the ocean was incredible. They arranged a tour of the Mayan ruins and we went Into the caves and a senote with the most knowledgeable tour guide.

"Not even 1 star !!!!   This company is a complete FRAUD.  They are the middle man and keep all the money themselves, will not speak to customers, will not provide ANY solutions to the problem and DO NOT offer any refunds for bad accommodations.   During Spring Break - April 4-9 2022.  We booked 3 bedroom Villa in Tulum, Casa Ganesh and had concerns of the music next door prior to arrival.  Our travel agent through Smartflyer, found this villa through Journeys Mexico - who we paid, however we didn't realize until we had issues at arrival that Maya Luxe controls the money and the experience.  Maya Luxe offered no options.  The Rosa Negra Day Club has the loudest music you have ever experienced pumping from 11 am to 7 pm everyday.  Think of being in a military torture chamber. ",20,640
" Then at 10 pm to 1 am the front of the club turns in to a music-dinner club.  You literally couldn't hear yourself think or relax or sleep.  We were told Tulum is famous for bars and nightlife, but this is a completely different experience.  At the Villa, which we paid $1500/night, we had NO Air Conditioning in the Master Bed and No Air in the main living area.  The hotel GM that the property is attached to was wonderful.  He apologized, treated us to lunch and provided their portion of the refund.  He said Maya Luxe knew the situation at the villa and still books people.  I have never experienced anything like this in our many travels.  We have been working with the President and COO of Journeys Mexico to try and get all our money back and they finally said Maya Luxe won't do anything.  Journeys Mexico and our agent refunded any commissions they received on our booking to help with the expense to go to a new place.    After 2 miserable nights, we paid our own way to move to a new location.  Travelers be warned before you book anything through Maya Luxe or even through another company where Maya Luxe controls the experience.",50,640

As soon as I mentioned possibly changing room further away, instantly they took care of it and was moved closer to the beach and on the upper level. It was PERFECT!!! They use the Whatsapp to make communication very easy for anything you need: coffee, cab, recommendations for places to eat, ect. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!!!! Its a smaller place and didn't have to worry about a lot of people and yet we were super",50,640
 close to any activity we wanted and even just to relax on the beach. I would give this place a 10/10.,50,640

I don’t love writing reviews like this as I know they damage a hotels future business.  But unless you are heading to Tulum to club every night until 4am this hotel is not for you.  We thought we were staying in a cool chilled beach pad. But there was nothing chilled about it.  The thumping house music from Rosanegra next door blared from 11am until 4am! It was relentless.   Even with ear plugs I could hear every word and could feel the music as it shook my body with the base.  It was relentless and exhausting and not acceptable.  The location is great. Right in the heart of it. But not good if you need to sleep.   The other reviews wax lyrical about amazing service but we didn’t get this. Service was mediocre.   Bed was large & comfy: just couldn’t sleep in it. Water in shower,50,640
 was hot and pressure ok.   Nobody asked us when we left if we’d enjoyed our stay: I assume our bloodshot eyes and exhausted demeanour told them the answer.   I would never stay again.,50,640

"This hotel was incredible. The location is perfect, walking distance to the main hot spots and popular restaurants. Having access to the other Ahau hotels was also a great benefit.   We stayed in a superior room which was modern and extremely clean. Really good value for money compared to other hotels located on the beach. The staff were super helpful and friendly, going out of their way to make our stay so fantastic. 24 hour security also meant we felt safe throughout our stay.  Other reviews mention the music from the beach club/restaurant next door. We couldn’t hear any music at night and slept really well with no disturbances. The music was louder during the day when using the hotel sun loungers on the beach, didn’t bother us as that’s part of the Tulum experience. We also",10,640
"When we found the hotel we were greeted warmly and well looked after. The rooms are amazing and right on the beach…literally! Rustic and fantastic, with a hammock outside on the terrace. The staff are very friendly and Eduardo looked after us well for breakfast  there was a nice breeze coming from the ocean which was cooling and pleasant when sitting in the open restaurant or on the beach.    Great stay ",50,641
"We arrived and I was instantly impressed by how beautiful it was! The server Isai was great! He told us about all the deals and was not wrong about how great the mango margarita was. The guacamole is really good. Very herby and fresh. Thanks to Jorge, Felix and Evi at the bar. They know what they’re doing.",50,641
The Hip Hotel is gorgeous! The rooms are right on the beach and have a rustic feel which we love.  All the staff is very friendly. Especially Eduardo who served us breakfast. Food in general is delicious here.  I highly recommend a stay here!,50,641
Wonderful restaurant with excellent service and yummy food. Abraham and Eduardo were very welcoming and helpful. The view is breathtaking. We stayed at the hotel and all the staff were very nice and kind,50,641
"This was the second time my husband and have been here. Last time we came in February 2020 before the pandemic, so we were so excited to get back. I love the rooms, and the service is wonderful, especially Eduardo and Abraham. It’s very friendly and peaceful. No loud party vibes. Good food for a hotel and delicious fresh juice and fruit every breakfast included!",50,641
Lovely view and wonderful service from Abraham and Giovanna. Dinner was accommodating for our vegan preferences.  Nice breeze coming in through the sliding doors and beach sounds were peaceful.  Vegan Caesar was good as well as the vegan pizza.,50,641

"We (fanily of 4) stayed here in a beachfront king double room which was just sublime. We had access to the terrance pool and could have food in the privacy and shade on our balcony. The Sea wind was a gift from nature as it gets very hot on the jungle side of the resort.  We attended various yoga sessions, healing ceremonies from the shalla and even clay paint on the beach it was all spectacular  Massive mention goes to Bernie and the other staff on the terrace, nothing was a problem and they were only too pleased to make sure you are wanting for nothing. Bernie was very engaging in a pleasant way and was great with our two kids especially.   Carmen the lady that serviced our room was excellent, fresh water and room done as you would at home everyday. Thank You!  Food was",50,642
" excellent, things from the bar are on the pricey end of things but for beach frontage service can you really complain.  The Sea swimming was incredible, quite powerfull and mindfull experience.

"I came here on a yoga retreat from my university - I can't speak to the quality of the yoga here as our instructor came with us from CA, but the staff was all wonderful and we had a lovely experience.

"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DISRESPECTFUL. We booked a so called ""Wim Hof Ice bath on the beach"" and when we showed up the organiser was ""out in town"" and tried to blame some other member of staff for not booking the event - when he was the only one managing it... we drove 2h that day to join the event that never happened. We were treated very badly and rude,... the place is overpriced with terrible customer service, I'm still waiting for a refund one month later...stay away...",50,642
This was the best thing I could ever have chosen to do for myself. Amansala and all the staff that work there are incredible; I am truly grateful to each and every staff member and instructor that works there. I chose the Bikini Bootcamp and although it pushed me beyond my limits; I honestly had so much fun. The schedule is incredible and a lot of care goes into making each day epic by the staff. I was never bored! Thank you so much!,50,642
"Spent 12 nights here on bikini bootcamp mid-March.  Perfect time to go, the weather was always warm, moving to lovely and hot most days. The twice-daily yoga especially was fantastic, lots of different teachers with different emphasis on their practice, all super good, and very qualified. It means that things never get dull and by the time I got back my body felt amazing. There's lots of other classes and activities on the menu, HIT, salsa etc. also regular trips out with the funster known as Carlo - he's fantastic in his local knowledge, super-experienced and works hard to make sure people enjoy, learn and get the most from their trip. Food is good to excellent, the massages are fantastic - lots of different types of massage to choose from, all of a consistently high standard.",10,642
" Melissa (the owner) is friendly, helpful and clearly works hard to maintain high standards throughout.  My room was beachfront and definitely worth the extra cost. Falling asleep to the sounds of the ocean was all part of the restful vacation I was seeking.   Met some lovely people, there's a communal table for bikini boot campers, (most of us travelled solo), so you can be as outgoing and social or reclusive as you want.",50,642

"I stumbled upon BeTulum over ten years ago for lunch and swore I would stay here one day. I’m a designer and the property and the rooms are so amazing. It is epic design in harmony with nature. It appears so effortless but I know all the effort it took.   We had room 28, an Aire Master Suite. It is closest to the left common pool on the trail. It is a second floor living room, master bedroom and private terrace with a staircase to a private rooftop terrace with its own soaking pool, lounge and netted suspension hammock. We have a stone bathtub outside our shower nestled in the palms. Our room overlooks the pool, restaurant, beach and ocean. It’s just far enough away for quiet and privacy but close enough to get back and forth from the action.   There is a coffee machine in the",50,643
" room, blow dryer, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, moisturizer, water, etc. There are plenty of outlets available and no converter is necessary for US electronics. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. House keeping has flowed in and out without any disruption.   Entertainment wise they played all my favorite Brazilian tunes during the day and there was an epic flamenco troop that performed one night.   The restaurant and beach servers are abundant and tend to your every need without being intrusive. Our favorite personnel was Jean Carlos, Rubin, Caarloss and Juan. I know I’m forgetting one name and I’m sorry for that. The food is incredible and I’m very picky. I have never had avocado toast that amazing.  The shining star of the property is the concierge Samantha. She is grace, kindness and professionalism personified. If I was in hospitality, I would steal her away for sure.   Tulum does have the algae issue this visit but BeTulum is the only hotel I saw cleaning the beach everyday, all day. We met many cool couples from all over and had a fabulous time. Covid test to return to the US is onsite and easy to perform in 10 minutes. Parking for our rental car was provided and free of charge.   I will miss this place!",50,643

"We decided to go to Be Tulum restaurant, after having a walk on Tulum’s beach. The place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. We loved being advised by Giancarlo about the food and the ceviches, which were maybe the best food we had in our entire trip in Mexico. He was the perfect waiter, and could answer every single question we had. After this amazing lunch, we thought we had to come back to Be Tulum and I went back for a smoothie the day after. Same atmosphere of peace, and great tastes. Giancarlo immediately recognised me, and remembered my name and my allergies. That is what you expect from a professional waiter. Finally, the last day, we decided to come back for our last lunch in Tulum, because we wanted to have this tuna ceviche a last time. Of course c we",50,643

Florencio from the front desk helped us throughout our stay with any questions we had was helpful and hands on with great food recommendations. We haven’t even left back home yet but we wanted to write this review and express our gratitude because that’s how amazing it was.",50,643
First time visiting Be Tulum. I saw it on instagram and decided to visit. We had the Agua Suite and it was beautiful and comfortable. We only ate at Maresias but there is a second restaurant as well. Everyone at Maresias we welcoming and we had great service. Carlos Ramirez and Javier Cruz were especially great. I felt like a princess. ,50,643
The hotel design was so beautiful and unique. Coolest hotel room we’ve ever stayed in. Ours had a private pool. The food was very good by the beach and our waiter Ruben was very nice and friendly. Would definitely come again. ,40,643
We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel! The food and rooms are great! The service at the hotel is really good. Everyone is very nice and happy to help. Especially thanks to Giancarlo who made our experience at the beach exceptional!,50,643
"This place is excellent! The service, the food, the environment!! Nothing to complain about. The beach is beautiful - although we could not use it due to the seawood and the crashing waves, it was still amazing. Private yoga sessions - wonderful! The food, the drinks, the smells, cleanliness! This place is a must!",50,644
"Superb service from the front desk to beach staff, always there to help, great cocktails! Good location, a quiet enclave in Tulum with restaurants and bars nearby allowing us a wander out for lunch and dinner at our leisure. ",50,644
"My husband and I stayed at Encantada while celebrating a birthday, and we were blown away by the level of service we received and how excellent the experience was. The staff was incredibly kind, genuine, and thoughtful every step of the way. We so appreciated seeing familiar faces each day!  We loved how private the location was and how well-maintained the room and amenities were. Very clean, very elevated and design-forward. The beach is excellent, and the food and drinks were beyond expectation. I’d highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for a low-key yet luxe experience away from the Tulum party scene.",50,644
"My wife and I stayed at Encantada Tulum for 2 nights and we absolutely loved it! The room was beautiful and offered a unique jungle experience while also having access to a private beach. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome and comfortable the moment we arrived. We highly recommend staying here!",50,644
"We visited Encantada as our final hotel on a 3 week trip around Mexico, hoping to have saved the best till last after reading some incredible reviews but we were a little bit underwhelmed.   The hotel itself is stunning, nestled away at the quieter end of Tulum beach and is a perfect escape from the loud beach clubs.   Our room looked great, and had all the amenities that we needed. The bed is so comfy! We did have an issue with noise though - we were on the ground floor and the room above were so loud that we ended up complaining. I dont think anything was done about it however, or at least we weren't told if anything had been. It was a real shame hearing the room above at 4am most mornings and did put a bit of a dampener on things.   We also felt that the staff weren't very",40,644
" present during the day. For example, when we were relaxing on the gorgeous private section of the beach you had to go up to the main restaurant if you wanted something as they didn't often come down to offer drinks etc.  The hotel is spotless and the staff work very hard to keep it clean, but each morning when we came back from breakfast from the onsite restaurant at around 9am our room was being cleaned. We found this a bit awkward as we then had to wait for them outside our room to finish before being able to access it again. It seemed like a bit of strange time to turn the room over and thought that when they saw us waiting they would let us in.  Other than that the staff are super friendly and welcoming and gave lots of local recommendations. You can also use the sister hotels - definitely recommend trying out  the pool at Radhoo over the road.   Not sure we would hurry back if we did come back to Tulum especially due to the price, but it was a pleasant stay.",50,644

The rooms are spotless, elegant, and comfortable. The property is impeccably maintained, beautifully designed, and had thoughtful moments throughout. The staff were absolutely incredible - I can't say enough about them and how at home they made us feel.   I don't think you could go wrong with any of the rooms. There is a private beach with ample cabanas mere steps away from each room. We were fortunate enough to get an ocean view room that was on the second floor and had an amazing porch perfect for all of the things. There are multiple dining areas offering amazing food and drinks, one overlooking the ocean and",50,644

We also utilized their concierge for arranging travel to and from the airport, a tour of Chichen Itza, massages, and a truly amazing Mezcal tasting - all of which were perfect.

"Wow what an amazing location this hotel is. Our room (casa alaya) ..basically it was a house on the beach …we came here with 5 girls and we had a blast!! Carla, david, raul, luis, fernando showed us impeccable service! Thank you! Carla the front desk girl helped us book a private chef to come cook us breakfast. And what a treat that was. Barbara, the chef was amazing..she made a delicious spread! The only thing that was a damper on our vacation was the insane amount of seaweed that prevented us going to the beach:( the hotel told us the best season to come back when there is less seaweed is oct- march. We will definitely return to Alaya!",50,645
"We were very excited when we booked Alaya months in advance. We arrived at the hotel with a group of friends. First of all, in this hotel you have to negotiate about everything in order to get a service or amenities. You negotiate on a beach towel, you negotiate on a coffee which is given in the morning free of charge, you negotiate on AC during as it's limited while you pay almost a luxury hotel rate in Eu or US. If you do not insist on the thing you want, you do not get it. (for instance: when my friend asked to use the AC during the day, he somehow got it, however we were told that we were unable to use it between 10:00 - 18:00) The funny part of our stay was on our second day we woke up with a Scorpion (please see on the pics) right next to the bed. We called the House",20,645
" Keeping and they came to take that as it was a very normal animal. When I asked for a room change as I didn't feel fine if that was the only scorpion in the room, I was refused. I seriously couldn't sleep and did not feel fine in that room. There was definitely a hole somewhere as we never left the door open. The reaction of the reception as well as the other employees was weird. They were not even sorry, they did not offer us anything else nor extended apologies. At the beach one server came 5 times to me and asked if I was okay and told me that I look stressed. It was very uncomfortable. I thought he did not believe that I was a hotel guest but although I showed him my key, he was still behaving very weird. In this hotel the issue is there is nobody responsible or the responsible people are not introducing themselves to the guests and taking responsibility of the incidents.  If you really want to stay there, definitely do not take the top floor. There are numerous animals falling down on you while sleeping from their ceiling. Ask them to give you a proper info about the hotel and events (we were on our 3rd day told that they have daily free drinks, we were not informed that there were yoga sessions in the hotel we were told that there was a private fitness event on our last day)  It was such a bad experience we had in Alaya. I genuinely not recommend.",20,645
…,50,645
"The hotel looks very nice on pictures, nevertheless our stay there was average. We had a room on the top floor, which means you are underneath the roof. The roof is made out of straw, which means there are small holes in it, which led to insects falling on our bed, very unpleasant. One morning we discovered a scorpion in our room, housekeeping removed it, they said on the one hand they had never had it before, but on the other hand they were like ""this was just the jungle, you have to live with that"". The hotel team offers coffee every morning, which is brought directly to the room. But this was not brought to us every day, but only on 3 out of 6 days. We found out from other guests that there is also a jungle gym and yoga classes, but we weren't informed about this when we",50,645
" checked in. The hotel is overpriced for what is on offer. Despite paying so much, breakfast is not included and the air conditioning only works at night, not 24 hours. The beach has beautiful, white sand, but there is a problem throughout Tulum that a lot of dead algae are washed ashore, which means you can't swim in the sea.",50,645

The staff and service is absolutely exceptional, especially Riccardo who always kept an eye out and took care of me while I was by the beach and in the hotel restaurant!  I took part in the daily morning yoga and sound healing- I felt so rejuvenated after those experiences, which was just what I wanted out of the vacation.  Front desk was an absolute pleasure, helped me book my transportation and Covid testing, as well as set up my complimentary morning coffee delivery to my room each morning.

A ten minute walk up the road brings you to a path down to a gorgeous beach and lagoon - since there is no parking nearby, it’s usually empty, and it’s great for shell hunting.  Overall, we highly recommend Casa Flores for a vacation or a longer term stay.  I can’t speak highly enough of our experience here - look no further for a perfect Todos Santos getaway!",10,648

"Beware of cancellation policy!! Having never been to Todo Santos before, we were unaware that the accommodations would be unsafe for my husband until we arrived. We were unable to stay and spoke to Barbara before leaving. She kindly agreed to a compromise refund which we greatly appreciated. However, approx 2 weeks later, we saw the full week of charges rebilled to our credit card. When reaching out to the owner, Barbara, again, she replied that she 'changed her mind especially after the review the people we were traveling with had written.' I absolutely can NOT recommend a business of any kind that does not honor their word. As a result, we had to pay a full week of charges for accommodations we never even used!! How sad that an owner would take her frustrations out on one",50,648

"We got a great last minute deal when we changed our plans and we were delighted with this small, basic and very clean hotel.  The location is central (which comes with a bit of street noise and music), but it is close to everything and you can walk everywhere.  This is a very basic hotel but the rooms are big and clean, the bed is very firm, and the bathroom small and basic.  You will only get two towels, two packets of shampoo, and two bottles of water, but you will also get a table and chairs in your room and a lot of space.  It is really all you need, but not luxurious.  There are spaces outside to relax and people are very friendly.  There is very little English spoken, but if you have some basic Spanish, you can get along.",40,649

We like this place. It was clean and the bed was firm. The only problem is the noise from cars without mufflers and dogs that fight during the night. It is a great low budget option because Todos Santos is way over priced. ,30,649

"Maria Bonita is not luxurious but is well located in down town Todos Santos and has all the essentials -a/c, t.v., shower with reliable water.     It is near most restaurants and shops in the charming town of Todos Santos.   Good value for money and helpful staff. Recommended,",40,649
"My friend and I stayed there for one night after we landed in San Jose Del Cabo and rented a car and drove up here. Very clean and a very nice girl in the office!! She didn't speak much English, so it was fun to try and brush up on my Spanish. Right in the center of town. The beds were a little hard but we managed. For the price of only $37.00 a night it was hard to beat!!",40,649

Surrounded by lush vegetation, the rooms open onto a brick courtyard that steps up to a lovely pool area. The spacious rooms are finished in Mexican decor and are complete with a mini kitchen, including a fridge. There is no office or main reception area. You will be greeted at the gate with a welcome sign with your name, room number and date on it. Your key will be in your door. The cleaning lady stopped by to make sure we had all we needed.

The hotel is located in town at the end of the main street, perfect for walking into town. There are many restaurants close by within reasonable walking distance. There is a designated parking area for your vehicle behind the hotel. This little gem is so charming, very quiet and very unique. It has a different feel from a standard hotel as there is no central reception area, so you are on your own more, (although the pool area was a lovely socializing spot). We loved it as it felt like our home and was so unique! Thank you Alice!",40,650

"Nice place and economical. Pretty hard to find much of anything in this price range within Todos Santos.  Large clean room, nice patio and pool, and laid back vibe.  Todos Santos itself is a bit rarified with affluence and tourist trappings and not our cup of tea.  Much preferred La Paz for its lack of tourist amenities. ",50,650
"We stayed at the hotel part of the Posada. Rooms are beautiful and spacious, although pricey compared to many other places in the region, although Todos Santos in general is very expensive. Service was really loose, our room was not ready by 5:30 pm, it was difficult to find the owner and there was no one in sight for most part of the night (no guard, no one). No wifi. No receipt for our payment except for an informal piece of paper worth nothing anywhere. I wonder if they pay taxes... We were a bit disappointed, to be honest.",10,650
"So glad I stayed here, one of the best places I went to, and I was nervous after reading some reviews. I reserved online, all went smoothly, except the owner was a little hard to find at first. Just hang out at the pool for awhile--it helps to be laid back here. room was large, with a kitchenette, and the pool area is gorgeous. another review said it was far from downtown and restaurants, but i disagree.. can check it ona map, but a restaurant next door, a block down at end of street there are 4-5 others, and about 5 blocks to downtown. i saw the maid cleaning the rooms, and she did a fantastic, thorough job. owner was very generous and it is just a beautiful place. drinking water, glasses, plates, etc. in room, also shampoo and conditioner. the town itself is far from the",50,650

Apparently they were staying for three nights which was more than our one. To compensate for this she stuck three beds side by side into one room for myself, my husband, our toddler, 8 month old (who does not sleep through the night), father and mother in law to squish into, like sardines. There was a reason we had two rooms booked! To make matters worse, she offered no apologize for changing our booking and seemed indifferent to completely derailing our plans. Even worse still, she offered no discount for the room and wanted to charge $130 USD. We did not stay here and ended up making the",50,650

"We enjoyed an extended stay with family at Casa Rancho for 2 weeks over Christmas and new year. We rented just over half of the complex including; a contained suite, separate master suite, an outside bunkhouse containing two bedrooms with shared bath and a large main gathering house equipped with large living/dining and kitchen space. Casa Rancho is located a short drive from Todos Santos, it is safe and some amenities are within walking distance.  The grounds and gardens are a beautiful oasis within the dessert and the unheated pool provided a refreshing dip. However, our host (Alec) was not that responsive via phone or email and, upon arriving, he proved to be evasive and sometimes hard to get answers from. Getting our sheets changed at the one week mark was challenging and",30,651
" tested our limited Spanish with the house keepers. We never did have luck refreshing our kitchen drying towels. After about 5 days we located the storage shed for supplies such as toilet tissue, garbage bags and fresh kitchen sponges. The mosquitos seemed to favour my youngest and Alec did provide a bug net at our request (which helped immensely). Alec encouraged us to cut an agave bloom spike for our Christmas tree, which my kids enjoyed decorating. Unfortunately Alec never followed though with a deep sea fishing contact/arrangement. We were also disappointed to not have a resource book; many rental home owners compile a list of recommendations for guests.... these usually contain local tips for tourism, dining, shopping, markets etc. which can be very helpful to renters.  We are seasoned vacation home renters and this place ticked a lot of boxes. I truly feel this rental could be so much better with a deep cleaning; all ceiling fans were in need of dusting as were the light fixtures (dead bugs), dusting is also a must on art, door/window frames and shelves. The dish drying rack was rusted and had large calcium scale build up. Many of the cupboards including the pantry could use a thorough cleaning (under the sink is in desperate need). I did clean the spout on the water dispenser which left a lot to be desired. Our bedding was worn and the duvet cover did have some staining. A number of outdoor seating options were ripped/worn down to the foam, we also didn’t have any usable outdoor dining furniture. We enjoyed the reliable stove/oven and the outdoor wood pizza oven. The main house is fabulous for gathering and game playing. The rustic mix of pans and dishes fit perfectly with this rental. With some simple maintenance and attention to detail, this rental would be amazing.  We truly felt like our hosts were the resident house dogs (Linda and Mancha), they welcomed us each morning with smiles and wagging tails. Like true friends the dogs accompanied us on walks to the market and beach. In my option... the dogs are this home’s true hosts.",40,651

"My wife and I spent an evening at Casa Rancho in mid-January 2017. The accommodations are 3,000 feet down a dirt road a couple miles from the city center of Todos Santos. You'll definitely need a rental car to get there. We had a Nissan March and had no trouble negotiating the road. The grounds are expansive with brick / gravel paths connecting buildings and common areas (Pool, kitchen area, and upper viewing deck). Palms and various foliage provides adequite shade. All was neat and tidy. We had a private room with ensuite bath and it was very nice. We paid $60 cash all fees and taxes included. Large room with a great bed with beautiful bath area with shower. Ceiling fan but no air conditioning - which isn't needed in January. Not sure about July though...  Right outside our",50,651
" door and down a few steps is a common area building with a full kitchen and seating area. Very nice. Even had a hand press juicer so we got some oranges from a local market and had fresh OJ in the morning. Coffee maker, cups, plates, etc. are all available. Next to the kitchen building is a small pool which appeared clean (I didn't go in). The upper viewing deck has a few comfy chairs to look at the Pacific in the distance and a hammock, though the hammock was ripped so I didn't trust it to hold me.  The only issue with Casa Rancho is its location being so far off the beaten path. As mentioned previously, no problem getting there with directions but getting those directions was a major ordeal. I contacted Alec via email about 5 times requesting room confirmation and directions and never received them. Four phone calls produced similar results. To be fair, he does carry a cell phone and he does pick-up on the Mexican number listed on their website. So I had to call with my Google Voice number under WiFi (at the La Esquina Restaurant) and he directed me to their front door.  As a service to anyone else wondering how to get to Casa Rancho, here are some directions. Go to GPS coordinates:   23.458256, -110.240395. It’s a paved road to these coordinates. There's a building on the northeast corner with a huge Quaker State mural on the side. Go down the dirt road to the northeast (opposite direction of the market across the street). Proceed down the road and keep left until the road comes to a T-bone. Turn left and proceed down a low ravine and turn left again at the first opportunity. Casa Rancho will be just ahead on the right. GPS coordinates of Casa Rancho:  23.461441, -110.237624 My wife and I enjoyed our brief stay and Monica, one of the owners, was very nice and accommodating. We never met Alec who was taking a break while we were there. The value is terrific as Todos Santos accommodations, for the most part, are lunatic pricey.",50,651

"This location is quite beautiful and really gives you a taste for the local flavor of Todos Santos. The grounds are well kept, clean and comfortable. There is a lovely spot for morning yoga looking out onto the arroyo and ocean horizon. The ability to rent mountain bikes is also epic if you are without car and a fun way to get through town. There are fully stocked shared kitchens (but I believe you can get casitas with kitchen as well) and there is a nearby local store where you can get everything you need. Alec is incredibly helpful in providing some tips on where to eat, hang and/or access the beach.",50,651
"If you are looking for a quite spot filled with natural beauty to stay then this is the place. Alec, the host, was very helpful with local information and recommendations.

The whole grounds are like an oasis in the city.  The rooms are large and all decorated tastefully.  There's nothing else like it.

"During a quick COVID get-away, we spent 3 of our nights in Todos Santos, Baja Sur.   Casa Bentley was the perfect venue for us.   The hotel feels like it is out-of-the-way due to its walls, architecture and landscaping.  However it is on the northern edge of the Village of Todos Santos.   We were able to easily walk around the main part of town from the hotel.  There was onsite parking, so we were able to park behind locked gates, and drive to and from Todos Santos as we desired.   It was perfect!  The architecture of Casa Bentley  was magical.   It felt like we were in a castle, surrounded by mature trees and lovely gardens.   Local ""red granite"" blocks formed the exterior and interior walls.   Embedded in the mortar through out the facility were quality cabochons of agate,",50,653
" quartz, jasper, etc.  (The owner's father was a collector.)  Many of the interior and exterior design touches were lovely.    This is not a hotel for people wanting clean modern lines, large closets with tons of storage, and other modern conveniences.  That being we had a comfortable king-sized bed, hot water and good pressure, an outside patio and plenty of room for us to spread out inside the room and bathroom.   There was a place for our unpacked clothing, and to store the suitcase.  The wifi was adequate, although the thick rock walls blocked it, so we had to be by the window, door or outside for a strong signal.  Our Sprint/t-mobile cell signal was excellent, though.         Concerning the grounds, they were fantastic.   We are avid birders, and the old trees leftover from the orchard days were full of birds and did not disappoint.  Plus, there were a diversity of birds and lizards throughout the gardens.   The patio was a wonderful place to hang out in the mornings to sip coffee and watch sunrise turn to day.   Casa Bentley provided quality coffee that we brewed in the shared kitchen.  If we had wanted to prepare our own meals, that ability existed with a well-stocked kitchen.   However we preferred to take our meals in town.    The hospitality was A+.   We were the only guests, so they upgraded our room to a suite at no charge.  However, even our original room would have been terrific.   Robert Bentley the owner lives onsite.  He is an elderly character, and we enjoyed visiting with him by the lovely pool.   His very nice poodle was also a pleasure to have around; we missed our dog.     Alvaro L Alvarez Paz, the Property Manager, was an excellent host.   His English was very good, and he gave us a wonderful orientation to the grounds, shared kitchen and room.  He and his family live onsite, so he was easily available.  (We had questions about the wifi and a small water leak in the bathroom, which was resolved.)    Alvaro is a Todos Santos local, so he also gave us a great orientation about the area.    We were pleasantly surprised and pleased with the complimentary gift certificate for two free buffet meals at the nearby La Generala Restaurant.   The food and atmosphere were so good, we returned for another meal on a different day. (I will be submitting a separate review.  This restaurant is not to be missed, either.)  So, if you are looking for a hotel with comfort, character,  nature, and a memorable experience, seriously consider booking a room at the Casa Bentley Boutique Hotel.  If you are looking for a cookie-cutter chain hotel such as a Ramada, Hilton, Red Lion, Marriot, etc, this is not the hotel for you, however maybe you should expand your horizons and try something different!",50,653

Fall asleep to the sound of the crashing breakers, wake up to the song of the desert Thrashers and doves Walk to town for breakfast... b) Style - The rooms are laid out as classic Casitas - with a shared kitchen - what could be better?

He searched half the town in the dark to fetch us! Unbelievable! He is a great host - and even let us check out *hours* late.

Just a big enough cupboard to hold a fridge with water flagon & single electric (worm) ring on top, right next to a stone sink with cold water tap. More like glamping!  Great location: just 5 mins walk down sand track to beach where we watched humpbacks spout beyond the surf",50,655

Alberto was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable about the area, and his advice was spot on. While it might seem a bit out of the way, it is an easy drive to town but away from all the noise ... and the beach is a very short walk out the front door. Spending two weeks in south Baja, this was by far the most relaxing and enjoyable stay, and we plan to return.",50,655

None the less, beds are cheep and incredibly uncomfortable, the beddings are not hotel grade and not in line with the rates they charge. We had no room service for the duration of our stay, 3 nights and the room was not exactly clean when we arrived. Seams like a bachelor own the place and this is how it feels. I would have enjoyed the grounds a lot more if they did not have laundry drying all day long right in the center of the gardens.",40,655
"In the beginning I thought I'd made the wrong choice for the 3 of us. I'd gotten the impression that we could walk to town and manage without renting a car. Driving in Mexico has never been my favorite thing to do. But Alberto, in his very kind way, suggested that a car would be most useful. And Alberto was always kind and helpful. While he was ever-present in his own dwelling on the property, you never saw him, but when you called his name, he was there and ready with suggestions.   Anyway, after trying to work out public transport from the airport in Cabo, we gave up and rented a car.  Which turned out to be very inexpensive and very worthwhile! We could cruise around,( the main road was paved), and discover other beaches!   I could talk about the small and lovely town of",50,655
" Todos Santos, but I want to devote more of my review to Sole Caliente. It was beautiful, clean, quiet, and had all the needed amenities. But, for me, the amazing piece, was the beach.  It was about 5 mins. walk and so totally uncrowded and non-commercial, that we would spend 2-3 hours each day just walking. It was heaven.  The ocean isn't for swimming in this area, and in March at least, it is a bit chilly, but oh the colors of that beautiful, mesmerizing surf!  And throughout the night you could hear it pounding against the shoreline. The stars at night were brilliant and the property was always so peaceful. We will go back one day!",50,655
…,50,655
"most of the reviews for this lovely place talk about the amazing food.  Now, make no mistake, the food is amazing, both in presentation and taste.  And the place is beautiful and clean and we enjoyed the views and the peacefulness very much.  But we most enjoyed our hostess (and host), their friendliness, their pride in what they were doing.",50,656
"When you leave, you will dream of Isabella's food until you return. A small B+B (2 rooms in a separate building) owned by Isabella and Gabriel. To say the are a wonderful, charming couple is far from adequate. Accommodations are always clean and comfortable. The grounds are beautiful. Close to the beaches-- 20 minute walk with some hills. Close to Todos Santos--10 minute drive and you need a car here. The roads of La Poza, the neighborhood of Todos towards the ocean are dirt, rutted, and not well marked so arrive during daylight if at all possible. But it is all worthwhile to stay at Casablanca and enjoy the hospitality of its host and hostess. One last breakfast...un millón de veces.",50,656
"Isabel and Gabriel are wonderful hosts, and we could have just chatted with them about dogs and art and life all day. Isabel is an amazing cook, and breakfast was a highlight of our day. The property is gorgeous, peaceful, and has great views. We took wonderful walks to the beach, could see the ocean and whales from the house, chilled in our hammock, and played with the dog. We didn't happen to use the pool, but it looked great and had lots of space to relax.  If/when we come back to Todos Santos we will definitely stay here the whole time. I can't imagine a nicer place to be.",50,656
"We were fortunate to stay with Isabel and Gabriel, and enjoyed every moment! We booked their Tomatillo Room for 5 nights, which boasts spectacular views of palm-tree covered countryside and the ocean in the near distance. From their balcony on the first morning we saw a whale spout, and we were not disappointed by the wildlife or scenery. Isabel's breakfasts rival some of the best restaurants around the world: she's so creative and inventive with combinations and flavors, and the presentation was always perfect. But by far and away the best thing about Casablanca are the hosts--they truly care about each guest and maximizing our experiences and time in Todos Santos. Each morning Isabel would make great suggestions for day trips or activities, and even helped us book massages and",50,656
" a boat tour to swim with the Whale Sharks in La Paz. One of the best trips I've ever taken, and that is owed in large part to the hospitality we received at Casablanca. Thank you Isabel and Gabriel! ",40,656
…,50,656
"We loved our stay ay Casablanca, where Isabella and Gabriel under supervision from  Camillo (dog) takes  care of their guests in a wonderful way. Even if it is a little rough to get to Casablanca, once you are there, it is such a treat. You get the most amazing new breakfast every morning, and if you are ""lucky"" also wonderful dinner from Isabellas kitchen. They also have lots of really good suggestions about, what to do in the area. The  2 rooms are great and there is a little pool to cool off in in the garden. The garden and pool area are rustic, but adequate. So if you want to be treated like royalty and don't mind being a little out of town, this is your place. If this review had been only about Isabella, Gabriel and their service, we would have given  highest points. Thank",50,656
" you for your hospitality, and we hope to be back and be pampered again.",50,656
…,50,656
Isabel and Gabriel master the delicate skill of being perfect hosts. They are so kind in giving advice but are never too obtrusive.   Breakfast is delicious: a Euro Mexican mix.  Just Waw!  We had the upstairs room which is beautifully decorated.   We would come back in a heartbeat!  ,50,656
Los Colibris is an amazing getaway just a short drive from downtown Todos Santos. The grounds are stunning and both the hosts and chefs are fabulous. I came for a retreat and was almost overwhelmed by the hospitality and beauty of the grounds.,50,657
"Our group stayed at Los Colibris before and after going out to Camp Cecil. The rooms were wonderful! It was clean, spacious, comfortable with a glorious view of the gardens and ocean!  The gardens are gorgeous and full of birds. The breakfasts were professional prepared and amazing. Highly recommend this boutique hotel!",50,657
"As part of our TOSEA Camp Cecil adventure, we found ourselves in the lovely Los Colibris Casitas.  Set into the hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, this wonderful getaway was the perfect bookend to our time on Isla Espiritu Santo.  Away from the crowds of Cabo, Los Colibris offers spectacular amenities, including fully furnished casitas (wi-fi is available) and a marvelous dining experience at Iker's cafe.  Business or pleasure, you should take the chance to enjoy the hospitality at Los Colibris Casitas",50,657
"Our only regret is that we only spent one night. Travel up an off-the-path road and arrive at paradise.  The views are stunning as the resort is tucked into the mountainside. Seeing and listening to the ocean from our perch was special. We stayed in Bobisuri House and our room was fantastic with a large sitting area, spacious bedroom, super-large vanity and an open large shower with access to the outdoors. The room had a fridge, microwave and all the amenities. We loved the decor. The property is beautifully set into the mountain with a special pool surrounded by charming stone. We had a private cooking session in their kitchen which made for a fun and delicious evening.",50,657
"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in La Molflita casita. The views are spectacular and having the ability to watch the whales breach as they swim by and the sunsets, wow, the sunsets are worth the Mexican roads to get in there. We thought the GPS was wrong but after some bumps and ruts on the roads we pulled up to heaven.  If given the option to book a hotel right in town with restaurants and shops right there or back to Los Colibris with its bumps and ruts, we would go back to Los Colibris in a heartbeat!",40,657
Los Colibris is a magical hideaway tucked into a rugged landscape. It is the perfect setting for either a quiet getaway or as a base for adventure and exploration of the Baja peninsula. We truly enjoyed every minute and cannot wait to return.,50,657
"My husband and I stayed here for a week for our first trip (almost) post-Covid and it was exactly what we wanted--gorgeous, peaceful, and far from the madding crowds. We stayed in one of the Babisuri suites, with spectacular views overlooking the sea. Each of the casitas is totally private and beautifully decorated, and we hardly saw another soul. The grounds of Los Colibris are charming, with gorgeous gardens and friendly dogs and cats. Bryan, the owner, is a very gracious hostess and was willing to help arrange transportation and other local details. We did two of the day trips on offer, one to Isla Espiritu Santu to snorkel with sea lions, and one to Balandra Bay to go kayaking--these were super fun, gorgeous, and made all the more enjoyable by our guide Allen (request him!",50,657
" He's awesome!). Breakfast is available onsite (thank you, Eliazar, for the wonderful desayunos), but otherwise you'll need to eat in town. There are lots of excellent places to eat in Todos Santos, and guests are given a long list of recommended restaurants, all of which are safe and delicious. It's not entirely necessary to rent a car--Bryan arranged an airport transfer for us, and we enjoyed walking into town--but know that Los Colibris is about a mile from the center of Todos Santos, and the swimming beach at Los Cerritos is about 20-30 minutes away by car. (The beach at the base of the hill below Los Colibris is gorgeous but not swimmable.) Taxis are available, which is what we did for returning from town after dinner in the dark or going out to the swimming beach, but not everyone may want to do that. Cabo San Lucas this ain't, and that is the point. We loved every minute of our stay and are so grateful for such a wonderful retreat.",50,657
…,50,657
"I do not know where to begin. The Los Colibris resort is one of the best kept secrets out there. My wife and I stayed for 1 full week and did not want to leave. We stayed in the La Chucha casita and wished that we could just move in. The sound of the ocean waves, smell of fresh flowers, and amazing bright sunsets to name a few. We cannot recommend this place enough. Owners Bryan and Sergio were great to visit with and were very friendly. Town is only 1.9 miles away and the food was superb. Go see these nice folks. You will definitely want to return one day.",50,657
"Wow, what a spot. Amazing view of the pacific and an easy drive to town. A real treat to fall asleep and wake up to the sound of waves crashing in the distance. Well appointed and equipped room with the right amenities included coffee maker and ground coffee for morning cup on the balcony. Dirt road in is a little bumpy and rocky, we held our breath at times concerned it might cause a flat on the rental car, but all good. Amanda and team always very responsive and helpful. WiFi worked reliably when needed. Great value for the money, highly recommend!",50,658
We loved our stay at Villas La Mar. The view was stunning and it was very quiet and clean. Kitchen had everything we needed. Equipped with everything we needed for a relaxing stay.  Only downside was proximity to food.,50,658
"Villas La Mar was absolutely gorgeous - I even extended my stay because it was so pleasant! The dirt road to the location is totally manageable, and the proximity to the ocean / gorgeous views are top notch. Stayed in room 15 and room 18, both were amazing.  Would definitely stay here again!",50,658
"We loved our stay at Villas La Mar. The room was well equipped - the bed was comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, our balcony w/ fire pit was perfect, and there isn’t much better than taking a hot shower with a view of the ocean. We loved leaving the sliding doors open and just shutting the screen door so we could fall asleep and wake up to the sound of waves crashing on the shore. Amanda and the staff were very helpful when needed but left us to enjoy our time alone otherwise. It’s quite a hike up the stairs, which are only somewhat lit at night, but well worth it for the epic views. We loved it so much that we even tried to extend our stay. We will definitely be back.",50,658
"Stunning views of a pond and the majestic Pacific Ocean - modern stylish clean and comfortable. Coffee and coffeemaker provided, pool… in a small condo complex. Ten minutes down to the beach on a rocky trail. Short 10 minute drive to town yes, on dirt roads, that’s the only way to have an ocean view in Todos Santos!",50,658
"From the moment we arrived, the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. Once we walked to our room we were taken away with the breathtaking views and the beautiful and eclectically styled rooms. We spent evenings on the balcony listening to the waves, star gazing, and watching the moon set.. which is a sight to see! When we weren’t at Cerritos Beach, participating in an adventurous activity, or off touring the city, we spent the afternoons whale watching poolside and catching the warm sun rays. This is an outstanding place to stay and we would highly recommend it to anyone that is thinking of visiting Todos Santos.",50,658
"We spent 3 great nights in early February at this comfortable modern Airbnb. Cliff side location with awesome views of the Estero/Lagoon and ocean, tons of birds and whales.  The room was nicely furnished with a small frig/freezer, toaster, coffee maker, silverware, cups, glasses.  Nice shower.",50,658
"We had the good fortune to spend three nights in #18. The room had all the amenities necessary for an outstanding stay. The views were spectacular and the endless whale sightings only added to the overall experience, not to mention the sunsets are amazing. We are already planning our next trip back.",50,658
"Absolutely beautiful property. If you’re willing and capable to walk a lot of stairs, I highly recommend the upper level rooms. Watching sunrises, whales, and sunsets from a birds eye view every day was a treat. Bed was comfy, pools were cool and refreshing. Staff was all extremely friendly and helpful.",50,658
"This is the best place in Todos Santos. Everything is fantastic and the whole experience is curated to optimize for total enjoyment. Renting a car is very recommended, checking in is very easy. The room is spacious, clean and very confortable. The views from the terrace are breathtaking, enjoying a cup of coffee while whale watching became our favorite thing in the world. The walk to the beach is a beautiful path where one can appreciate the endemic flora and the beach is stunning. Amanda is attentive and very helpful, she went beyond and above to accommodate our every need. No words to describe it, this place is very special.",50,658
"Jenny is a great host, readily available and providing helpful info on the area. She designed and built The Hotelito, which has a colorful and bold architectural look with well designed rooms that are comfortable and practical for travelers. Very well maintained. Lots of seating areas outside so you can follow the sun or shade as the day progresses. Nice views from the hillside location. The pool area is large and a nice place to hang out. We walked down the quiet, narrow dirt road to the beach (15 mins) but drove into town (10 mins or less, depending on your destination). Jenny’s restaurant suggestions are useful (Mejibo & Jazamango). We loved the town and couldn’t imagine staying at a better place.",50,659
Beautiful property. So well-kept and quiet and private. Loved all the decor and outside space. Beds were so comfortable with lovely linens. Enjoyed breakfast on our private patio area each morning.  This place is a gem!!!! Would definitely return and highly recommend! Owner was very responsive to inquiries and there to meet us and gave us helpful information on Todos Santos. Couldn't have been better.,50,659
"Hacienda Chilicote (the 3 BR house at El Hotelito):  Fantastic, large, colorful contemporary home with private gardens, airy bedrooms and super comfortable beds.  Gorgeous bathrooms with powerful showers. Great to have a kitchen for cooking and lots of places to eat outside including an upstairs terrace with stunning views!  One cool night, we really enjoyed having a fire in the fireplace.  Swimming in the Hotel's salt water pool surrounded by lounge chairs under the palms was much appreciated!    The Location:  Superb and peaceful location within walking distance of a beautiful yoga/movement studio, a very hip outdoor cafe serving good food and live music and the beach--where we delighted in watching migrating Humpback Whales!   We found the center of town to be too noisy so we",50,659
" were very pleased with the quiet of El Hotelito.  Our Host: Jenny greeted us with the best Margarita my family had ever tasted and she accommodated our changing needs with grace.   Putting down roots in Todos Santos for the last 20 years, she is a big-hearted, English woman who cares deeply about the local people.  She has also rescued several animals who now live on the property-- including a very saucy pig named Collete who rampages through the fridge and now stars in a movie.  I love her creative and philanthropic vision!   We had a very happy 10 days at El Hotelito where we felt extremely safe and well cared for and we would book there again if we returned.  We highly recommend this beautiful and very unique boutique hotel to all!  ",50,659

Our stay at Hotelito was better than expected. From our personal greeting from our host to wonderful breakfast every morning to evening mesqual it was so enjoyable.  The accommodations were excellent and location easy to find. I would definitely recommend a stay at Hotelito.  ,50,659
"We stayed at the Hacienda  Chilicote for the second time in 3 years because  the location is excellent, easy walk to beach, all of the space you need for 6 people or intimate enough for 2. We love the full kitchen and Jenny's  always there to help with any questions , and recommend the best places to eat . She is always right on! We had people use the WIFI for work with no problems.  The animals make it a magical place and you will love the solitude. The staff is all top notch! Love , love , love.",50,659
We enjoyed our stay here. The lovely units are detached which adds to the privacy. Each cottage is a different colour. A car is a must as it’s located just outside of Todos Santos. Hotelito is in a quiet area within driving distance to the restaurants. The staff was friendly. I would recommend this place!,50,659
"I've been back to The Hotelito six times in seven years. You could say that I am addicted to the peaceful beauty of this insanely gorgeous property. Each year I wonder which Casa I will stay in next year, each more exquisite than the next. I come to leave my hectic urban professional life behind and write.  It has been an enormously productive environment for me while I attend the Todos Santos Writers Workshop. I want to come and just read five books in the hammock outside on my patio and do absolutely nothing. The minifrig with milk for my coffee, the French Press and ground coffee awaiting me in my room - the huge urn of fresh drinking water, each thoughtful gesture is characteristic of the Hotelito and its owner, the fabulous Jenny Armit.

"10-11/12  We three middle aged Brits were touring BC. We arrived at 2pm on a Tuesday at the bus station (1.25 hrs from San Lucas) and walked inland and uphill, grabbing some beers in a supermarket and eventually found this small sprawling motel complex on a dirt track.  The son saw us in and was very friendly. He offered to show us room 15, up the stairs and along the exterior corridor, which was basic and dated but clean and tidy. The laminated front door had seen a lot of weather but the view down the valley was nice. Local dogs, horses and crows were making themselves heard. I asked if we could have a chair for the walkway to sit on and enjoy the view. Two of us went to his reception to finish the check in, checkout the pool and terrace area and grab a wooden chair from his",30,660
" actual family house. This proved useful and one at least should really be provided anyway.  We chilled in the room in the heat of the day and used the reliable WiFi.   We did not take advantage of the inviting pool or patio at all as only there overnight.  The main room had two double beds on wooden bases with a small bedside table with two drawers between. A table with drawers supported an old-school crt tv which we ignored. Behind the TV was a wardrobe with no coat hangers at all in the tall space  but only two shelves on the right.  The WiFi was good when we arrived and at night but hiccuped in the morning a few times.  There was a large fan in the middle of the room, no A/C which was fine for us. It was controlled from the main door.   The only room lighting was two over bed lights controlled from the middle of the beds.   There were windows onto the walkway and also to the back of the hotel. All were protected with mosquito mesh although we never had a problem with mosquitoes. There was no mesh in the door of no 15.   The shower room was compact with a toilet and basin. There was no lightbulb in the socket over the mirror, luckily I had my own and another for the socket by the sink to help shaving. Two bars of Rosa Venus soaps were supplied As well as a small bottle of shampoo. Only two large towels were supplied for the three of us (as only couples usually book).   Overnight was surprisingly quiet with few local dogs, stereo systems disturbing our sleep. There was one eerie episode of a couple of howling canines sounding like (now almost extinct apparently) wolves (NOT coyotes). In the morning likewise with not even cocks crowing too much! The bed was a bit lumpy but we had walked 14km that day and slept well for 10 hours!  In the morning the shower behaved well although it took a while for the hot water to feed through. The heavy curtain also kept the light out from our east facing room, although it collapsed on opening it as it was held up by two simple nails. Not a big deal, this room is basic!  We made a coffee with our water heater element and bottled water from San Lucas. We did not want to rely on the coffee provided by our hosts.  On checking out we were offered a coffee each and sat in the pleasant patio (by the productive vegetable garden) chatting with the friendly son for a good half hour. Something told me that we should not leave yet.....  The walk to the spectacular beach by Villas La Mar is signposted from the edge of town. It is a half hour trek along a dirt track for cars and at the end are large gates which are open. The public path continues through the complex and down the side of a colourful rocky and cactus lined embankment to the beach. We walked to the northern end to find groups releasing turtles at sunset. Please buy a souvenir from the non state aided volunteers who run the show. We walked back via the main track into the town to see the delights of the town, mostly too posh for us, and ate in the good Tacos y Mariscos El Sinaloense. We popped into the Hotel Cal for a beer too just to see what the fuss was about (it was not on a dark desert highway at all!).  Overall this was a relatively expensive place (by 50% of our usual spend) for a very basic place compared to higher quality in San Lucas or Los Cabos. It is remote so this is an expensive town. The friendly owners, pool, views and patio make up for the basic rooms. They are obviously caring about their guests but do not have the income to renovate or improve the rooms. A plastic chair in the room would have been useful as three of us in a twin room meant things were stored on the floor, albeit clean. The bathroom could have done with a deep clean, especially round the toilet the base of which was not a pretty sight from the shower. There was also a leak somewhere if brown liquid under the sink which needed cleaning up with toilet paper before being able to stand at the sink.  I think that after our coffee we will finally check out and leave (finishing off this post and submitting now)!",50,660

The hostel in town was cheap and got great reviews but as I was here for nine days I wanted a place to stay that was more secure and would give me a place to retreat alone when I needed it.  The Hotel Miramar was perfect on all counts. A warm, friendly family that runs the hotel (they don’t speak much English which was fine with me!); clean, simple, pretty accommodations, including a small pool; and a place that was walkable to town (I didn’t have a car; it took me ~20 minutes to walk to the town center).

From the ease of WhatsApp-ing breakfast orders to getting excellent food and cocktails at the pool, Villa Santa Cruz is the BEST. Thank you for such an unforgettable weekend!!

Both rooms were exceptional with stunning views of the ocean.  The grounds are so well kept and beautiful. The small details - like coffee and juice at the door in the morning and little treats before bedtime make this place extra special. Room service breakfast was wonderful, all of the cocktails were amazing and we saw some of the most beautiful sunsets.  A very special thank you to Carol, Marco and Victor for making our stay memorable - but truly all of the staff were amazing!

The owners have done an excellent job integrating the hotel and grounds into the natural landscape of the property. The staff are all super nice and incredibly helpful. Breakfast was delivered to our room daily, and was delicious, as were the MANY mezcalitas at the pool.  The property also hosts the Green Room beachfront restaurant, which was also super tasty.

"You need to stay at the Villa Santa Cruz in Baja’s Todos Santos. I have always been a big fan of Baja. But, I have found my new favorite spot in Todos Santos.   The Villa Santa Cruz is 13 km or 25 minutes North of Punta Lobos and only 15 minutes North of Hotel California Todos Santos and the main drag in town. Punta Lobos is where you will find local fishermen heading out in their Pangas; it is also home to the beautiful yet stuffy Hotel San Cristóbal.   When you get to the Villa Santa Cruz, there is almost nothing there. It is perfect. The hotel is backed by Baja palms, sand dunes, and an agave farm. There are 15 rooms total, each unique. We stayed in the brand-new Tented Ocean Suites. These luxury tents are 60 feet from the water at high tide, and the sounds of the surf will",50,661
" lull you to sleep each night. The Tented Ocean Suites each have their very own fire pit on the beach, perfect for watching the sunset.   You can also watch the sunset from the treehouse, which offers incredible vistas from Punta Lobos in the South to as far North as the eye can see.   At night you can dine either at the hotel itself or the beachfront restaurant called The Green Room, which offers some of the freshest fish I've ever had and some of the smoothest Mezcal from Oaxaca. I recommend the Rosarito Beach Rolls with smoked tuna and Calafia with sea bass sashimi with serrano and soy sauce.  I highly recommend looking into Villa Santa Cruz in Baja's Todos Santos!",50,661

"WARNING: HOTEL STAFF STEALS YOUR MONEY! We stayed three nights in this place. The third day, after returning from the beach, I found my moneybelt in the room but WITHOUT my money, and it was 5000 pesos!! Every day there are cleaners, they took it out. When I confronted the owner with the situation, he said that ""it will never be safe to leave money in any hotel"", to me it is the proof they are thieves. But because it was cash money, I could not proof anything. I just reported the situation to the local police, and now I am trying to warn you! DO NOT GO HERE!!",10,662
"While we had lowered expectations at 400 pesos a night, we felt that this hotel could use a few improvements that are simple to do and it would be quite nice to stay in. For example fully screwing in light fixtures, adding a shower head to the rusted pipe in the shower, and a window pane or even a wood plank to cover the busted window overlooking the foot path above the shower. Other than that, the sheets were clean and the air conditioning worked marvelously, and the staff was helpful. ",20,662

We did not want any luxury, but did not expect to find a rusted fridge with bugs! haha1 but hey! we did not even expect to have a fridge! The place is good if you are in a budget and you can get cheaper for only one bed. It is ideal if you are not fuzzy, and there is no reason to be, you will be out most of the day. The shower had actually no shower head, just the open end of the pipe, but good hot water. Real travellers won't mind any of this and may even not care about paying and would instead look for somewhere to camp. I even felt to posh for paying and camping...",30,662
"We planned to stay multiple nights, but left after the first. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend, but I can see how certain travelers wouldn't mind.  PROS: Cheap Central (well, Todos Santos is small so...) Clean sheets, floor.. Friendly office  CONS: Awful putrid smell (nothing to do with ground-floor Laundromat) Aggressive fluorescent lighting Broken toilet Green and moldy pool A near complete absence of furniture other than the bed, TV and stained and scary green armchair) Wifi only works near the office",20,662
"I loved this place. At 450 pesos for a twin with private bathroom, it was on the lower end of hotels in town, and it still came with little perks you normally don't get in a budget place. There were four bottles of water and a new bar of soap in our room when we arrived, and though we only stayed one night everything got replenished by 9.30 the next day. Same with four clean towels. In fact the whole place smells wonderful from the launderette on the ground floor, and the staff keep the white tile in the rooms clean as a whistle. There's also a small, grimy pool that you probably won't wanna swim in, but that looks perfect for Walden filtered fashion shoots. Smiley, friendly service and right in the middle of town (not that that's hard wen the town consists of two streets).",50,662

"Gorgeous hotel and best in town - creates it's own perfect little world within its four walls. And much more stylish than the other smart place in town right across the road (whose beach club you can still use for a $30 fee).   Food delicious, hammocks loungers and plunge pool in the beautiful garden, friendly staff, bikes for heading to the beach (which is stunning by the way - do make the effort), great attention to detail. It's like out of conde naste or vogue or Mr and Mrs Smith. ",50,663
"From the photos I was not sold, but once we got here. The location is right in town. Pretty quiet at night. The beds were so comfy /firm, including great pillows and soft towels. The pool is small and quiet. Very relaxing. It is super clean and well maintained. We stayed midweek. Free breakfast was included and delicious. There is air in the room, lots of light and black out shades. The mixologists at the bar were excellent. Generally we just had a great overall experience. Muchas gracias.",50,663
"A 100+ year old fresco greets you at the small check in lobby behind the charming brick walls, you know you are somewhere special. The small hotel has the charm of a Mediterranean villa, the atmosphere of a tranquil oasis, the most comfortable rooms, incredible bar, amazing food and thoughtful and attentive staff.  The only thing that could improve the experience is that you find a unicorn under the bed and the winning lotto numbers on a napkin.   Otherwise you will just have to put up with the quaint perfection of this amazing place.  thanks",50,663
"Ever since my first visit to Todos Santos in 2021, I've wanted to stay at this lovely, historic Inn.  Finally, that wish came true this past week.  My wife and our two dogs were welcomed on short notice after our Airbnb flopped due to a faulty hot water heater.  Tosos Santos Inn to the rescue!  We arrived at 20:30 on a Wednesday night and Hector, who was at the front desk met us on the street just as we pulled up.  He was awesome and took care of helping us get our bags and the dogs settled in the room.  Our room was like a casita with a private garden area, perfect for the dogs to hang out.  We enjoyed a nice dinner and complimentary glass of Chardonnay.  We will be back again...but only after they complete rennovations which they say will be done in December 2022.  Gracias",40,663

"We stopped for one night in Todos Santos while driving from La Paz to Los Cabos. The town is small and nice with many shops (closing very early in the afternoon) we stayed at Todos Santos Inn and it has been a very good experience. The place is an old Mexican building with large rooms, high ceiling and a beautiful garden with a small pool. The personnel has been very professional and kind, the breakfast is “top” and the price very honest. The bar is “English style” offering a good variety of spirits and cocktails.  Many restaurants at walking distance. Definitely a positive experience, despite the “hot & humid” season!",50,663

We cut our stay short because of the above",40,663

I believe Juerg made them and they were so delicious and strong - definitely recommend dining at El Gusto and trying them. I spent the rest of the trip comparing and missing them!  Stayed 2 nights in one of the junior suites. Getting to the hotel is the only downside as you will need a car and the road is a bit rough, but that leads to the quiet seclusion. The grounds are just gorgeous and close enough to the ocean to hear the waves crashing at night. The room was large, the sheets super soft, and had a small jacuzzi outside.

Possibly the most beautiful place we’ve stayed in Mexico. We pretty much have the place to ourselves. Surprised the Baja is empty. They are serious about masking and distancing here.  And, they are doing rapid Covid tests all over town and at the airport. So it’s no big deal to get your Covid test before you hop on the plane home.

Out highlight was ordering of a delicious bottle of hand-selected Sauvignon Blanc from Valle de Guadalupe delivered to us with a snack poolside.

Serious footwear required.  -Jackhammering in neighborhood at 7a and continued throughout the day -Owner would not refund our cancelled nights, even though there were several rooms still available. (We had offered to pay for 1 night cancellation, even though the jack hammering made our stay unbearable) -Fireplace is dangerous and inconvenient. You must sign a waiver.

We stayed in the Casita for the first few nights which was very nice and comfortable with a great patio looking out on the beach.  Then we moved to the upstairs one bedroom, which felt very luxurious, with fantastic views of the sea and the mountains.  We used the well equipped kitchen to make breakfast every morning and we went out to dinner every night at one of the many great, inexpensive restaurants in the area.  The house had all the toys we could want, beach umbrellas, boogie boards and a kayak.  It was very hot when we were there in July, but the upstairs stayed very cool and comfortable.",50,670

During our last two nights three women were in the downstairs space and we didn’t hear them at all.  We thought we might eat out more but it was so fun to watch the sunset and cook (kitchen was well equipped) that we stayed in all but one night (went to Hierbabuena right up the dirt road—amazing.

All kinds of sea birds is cruising by, then a full size road runner,j just like bird in the cartoon, runs across the yard with a lizard in his mouth. Several pods of whales are jumping in clear sight and about a dozen surfers are riding nicely pealing waves 200 yards north of the house. Wait a minute. Where am I?

Property manager Giovanni was very responsive to our needs, but never intrusive. Our one stove issue was addressed within minutes after I sent an email.  We did find the kitchen supplies to be somewhat limited, and as a result we didn't cook quite as many of our meals as we might have otherwise. For example, we didn't have sharp knives or a cutting board, and while we did find a juicer, it didn't work. Fortunately there were plenty of great dining options - both in Pescadero and in Todos Santos - but part of the allure of an oceanside casita with a kitchen is the option of cooking at home with fresh, local",50,670

We did figure out where and when the signal was strongest, and for the most part were able to work around it, but we also had to avail ourselves of other internet resources (like the nearby Baja Beans) in order to make sure we got connected when needed.  Beyond that, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more spectacular view. The deck overlooks the Pacific ocean, not more than a few hundred yards from the San Pedrito surf break.

For the last 2 vacations to Los Cabos, we stayed downtown in Cabo San Lucas, so we decided to get away form the party scene and try Todos Santos this year.  Through some internet research, I discovered Calycanto Casitas and decided to make a reservation.  We could not have been more pleased with our decision!  If/when we go back, we will definitely stay here again!!  There were 4 of us, so the large house was perfect.  (Casita means cottage, but to us, it seemed like a full sized house!)  The casita was COMPLETELY furnished, right down to the blender and lime squeezer!  Everything was there, including plates, bowls, cutting boards, silverware, drinking water, etc.......  There",50,671
" are a few houses in the area, but when the sun went down, you really couldn't tell that there was anybody around.  It was so peaceful and quite, and I even fell asleep in the hammock one evening.  We slept with the patio doors open and could hear the ocean while we fell asleep at night.  When we left the casita during the day, we didn't even lock the doors....we really didn't feel like there would be a problem.  I'm not recommending that you do the same, but we felt confident that our casita was safe.  Laurie and Ernie live on the property, so we felt pretty safe that nothing would be bothered.  I met Ernie the first day and he was VERY helpful in giving me some pointers on where to go, what to do, and where to find various things we were looking for.  I mean, who knew that fishing tackle was sold at Baja Tiles??  You can go there and buy tile, bricks, toilets, and fishing tackle!! If you are looking for an all-inclusive vacation where everything is provided for you, this is not for you.  But if you like to immerse yourself in the local culture and become a part of the community and feel like you are living with the people in that community, then I HIGHLY recommend a stay at Calycanto Casitas.  We recommend driving a mile or two to the north and hanging out at the surfers beach.....it was so much fun watching them.  Staying here, though, you really would probably need to rent a car so you can get around.  This is the first time I rented a car in Mexico.  It really wasn't a big deal, and it really was worth the effort just to be able to travel around and see and do various activities.  And it was absolutely amazing to be able to take a shower OUTSIDE with a view of the pacific ocean in the distance......that is absolutely impossible here in Indiana............",30,671

The pool and hot tub are lovely but the hot tub wasn't turned on for NY eve..a night we wanted to use it. The pool isn't heated so it's chilly. Lovely outdoor kitchen at the pool. There is some substantial lack of attention to detail and prooerty care. Exterior wood needs paint/stain. Inadequate night path lighting  is very dangerous-need many  more working solar path lights. Gravel vs flagstone much safer for walking unless flagstone close together. While casita is clean, it's not sparkling and a deep clean would go a long way.

Flora Del Mar is a little hideaway about 5 minutes from the Pacific Ocean in Todos Santos. We had a great time staying in the bungalow.

The rooms were private, supremely clean, well appointed with views of the ocean. We enjoyed star-gazing from the roof top terrace and fell asleep to the sound of the crashing surf.

We had a nice and clean little place to ourselves that included a kitchen and a great veranda where we could just hang out with a beer and watch whales jumping in the distance. The pool was a nice reprieve when the sun got too hot, and the beach is just a 2 minute walk from our front door. This isn't a posh place where you can expect 24 hr service, but instead is a laid back place of rest and relaxation for easy going travlers.",40,673

The owner, Marilyn was so nice and helpful. She set us up with surfing lessons at Cerritos beach and a whale shark expedition in La Paz.

Marilyn helped us arrange a whale watching outing with the local fisherman which was a blast.  Her property is absolutely gorgeous, with a beautiful pool and lovely landscaping.  We were after a very relaxing holiday, and Flora del Mar proved to be the perfect place.  The beach is a short walk away, and is stunning.  And our bed was amazing!

All of a sudden one of the staff demanded to know what room # we were in. I didnt remember, the #, only where it was located. It turned into an unnecessary hassle that i didnt appreciate.",10,674
"We (my wife and I, and one other couple) stayed here for 5 days over Labor Day weekend. The rooms were basic but nice and clean. We went with an ocean front room with hot tub on the balcony. I think we may have had the best room in the hotel as we got a corner room with 270° ocean views over the Malecon.  We sat out there multiple nights and took in the full moon over the ocean, waves crashing, and amazing breeze.   The staff was super helpful and gave us anything we needed. The manager (Raymur) answered every email we sent before arriving promptly as well.  The restaurant on site was very good. We ate there multiple times throughout our stay and everything we ordered was delicious.  If I had to find something to ""complain"" about, it is very minor.....but the pool looks much",50,674
" larger in the pictures than it is. We had very low occupancy, so it was great for our stay, but I could see it being a bit overcrowded if the hotel is full.  We would definitely consider staying here again. For the price we paid, it was above and beyond what we expected. Thanks you for having us.",50,674
…,50,674
Great staff. They helped me with all my needs.   And you get some excellent sunrise views.   Just the right amount of quiet on their side of the island...perfect.  I usually stay at another hotel but I believe Im  making the switch.   Thank you again.  ,50,674
"This hotel was great.  It is close to all restaurants and nightlife.  We enjoyed being able to sit on the terrace and listening to the ocean every day.  For someone that is used to fast pace environments, this is a great place to settle down for a few days and relax.",50,674
"We stayed here for 6 nights during our trip to Mexico and everything was like on pictures. The location of the Arcos hotel is great, near all tavernas, very close to beautiful playa Norte. The only thing which could be a problem is a very loud music from the bar across the street. If you dont mind the music until midnight or so this is a good choice. The staff was helpful but their English is not so good.",40,675
Los arcos hotel is smack in the center of Hidalgo Av. Easy to go do anything. Few walking blocks from the ferry. The room is big with tiny balcony to sit if you like .very clean. All as described at booking  The downside..... the casa musica is right across and later at night they have a screaming loud Alice Cooper type of band  ,40,675
"Wonderful hotel, close to everything, very clean and spacious. Lovely bathroom with a hot shower..but the bed. The bed was honestly so uncomfortable we were never able to be truly rested. It was like sleeping on plywood. I've stayed other places in Isla that weren't as bad as this. If you can fit it in your suit case - bring a mattress topper.   Also, the wifi barely worked for the 4 days we were there. If you can live without wifi and a comfortable bed - this is your place.   Lastly, the music is loud. We were on the Hidalgo side (by choice). We found it to be nice to simply open the sliding door and be able to listen to the music however, if you are a light sleeper or have small children, this would not be a good idea.",40,675
"If you can get a BACK ROOM for under 45, I'd say yes....If not, STAY AWAY. Great water pressure, Terrible shower heads, lumpy beds & front rooms are The Noisiest on the ISLAND! You can do better than this. Oh, watch out for the on site Price Increase!!",20,675
"This hotel is in the perfect location. Right in the middle of all the action and only three blocks from the beach. Room was clean, super hot showers, and cold AC. This is a no-frills hotel so you have to bring your own beach towels and the only time you see any employee is when they come to clean your room daily. Which they do a great job of. Only complaint I would have is the bed is a little hard. Will definitely return.",40,675
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Los Arcos Suites to celebrate his birthday. I have stayed on Isla before  and was closer to Playa Norte, but this room was way better to me. It's located near everything so you can walk around for food and shopping. We also liked that it was very clean and had amenities if you wanted to prepare your own meals. El Patio, which is a restaurant sits right across from the hotel, so late nights we would step out on the balcony with a drink and listen to the live music going on. Staff were friendly and the cleaning lady was the best!! Always remember to tip these women who work so hard to support their families. We will definitely be back again. ",50,675
"We are staying here now and absolutely love this place.  It's located on Hildago (the walking street) and right in the heart of the action.  Our room is very big and clean.  Updated and very comfortable.  Great air con and comfy bed.  We love the balcony because we can listen to music from the bar across the way (it's loud so bring ear plugs and you will be alright), people watch, sip drinks and eat breakfast.  The room is equipped with a fridge, microwave and some dishes.  The staff are all very nice and accommodating.  Just an all around great experience.",50,675
Awesome place in the heart of isla mujeres!  The room is very comfortable and very clean. The location is perfect! We just had to walk 5 min to the beach (Norte) - one of my favorite beaches ! It's beautiful.   Heidy (the receptionist) was very helpful! She gave us good tips to discover the island. We rented a golf car and had a blast! Suites los arcos is an excellent value for price! I highly recommend it !,50,675
"First time staying here, its a no frills place, but we don't need frills, just a great location is all and this place has it... I would definately stay there again, its across the street from my favorite bar!!!",50,675
"Biggest selling point was the location: right on Avenue Hidalgo, where many restaurants, bars and shops are clustered. Rooms come with balconies; be sure to request a room ""al frente"" if you enjoy people-watching (I was in room #6). This may not be ideal if you want to sleep before midnight, given the loud music and crowds. A lot of shops and restaurants close up by 12 a.m.  Another selling point: mini-fridge and coffee maker in the room. There's free wifi, air conditioning and cable TV. The hot water tap did not work in my bathroom sink but the shower had strong water pressure (think pressure washer!) and good temperature control.  The reservation ended up costing me about $196 CDN for two nights. The woman at the front desk said she'd prefer that I paid in cash to avoid",30,675
"We came here for breakfast and I was impressed. The food tasted great, orange juice was natural and this was some of the best breakfast I’ve had in a while. It’s a small area with one server and two cooks but they were attentive to everyone and brought the food out quickly.",50,676
"Excellent place in Isla Mujeres very safe, clean and quiet area. Owner Sadjid was very friendly and Explained everything around the area and where to go and eat. I loved the breakfast in the morning he was fresh and very organic I enjoyed my challa juice With pineapple it was delicious. Everything on the menu was delicious. The room is very clean and air conditioning is in very good working condition.  Definitely I will come and stay here again.  Thanks Sadjid for being a great hostess.",50,676
"I have stayed here numerous times over the years. Usually sola, but sometimes with my mom and sometimes with hubby. The rooms are clean, comfortable and have everything I need. Kitchenette, good wifi, great location, relaxing terrace with hammock and it’s quiet. The café in front has wonderful fresh food for breakfast and lunch. The little garden is beautiful and serene. Madjid, the owner, is around for questions and assistance. He is the nicest host possible!!  There are books to borrow, beach chairs and umbrella and even a cooler. It is just minutes to the beach, plenty of restaurants, an atm, ferry dock, malecon.",50,676
"My husband and I are on the last day of our 6-day stay here. We love everything about this place - the comfortable room (more like a little studio apartment), the nice setting around a lush little garden, the outdoor spaces, the lovely little breakfast cafe downstairs, and the perfect location on a pretty local street close to shops and restaurants, a short walk from the ferry, and an equally short walk to Playa Norte, the best beach on the island. Most of all, the place is a peaceful oasis just a block from the noisy and tacky tourist combat zone. Excellent daily housekeeping. Last but not least, Majid, the owner, is extremely welcoming, responsive,  helpful and thoughtful. We could just stay and stay....  Highly recommended.",50,676
"I loved this place! There are only three rooms, so it's always pretty quiet. The rooms are simple, comfortable, and clean. Madjid, the owner, goes out of his way to make you feel at home and tell you the best places to eat and visit. It's an easy walk from the ferry terminal. The breakfast restaurant in the front of the hotel is excellent, a little north of 100 pesos ($5 US these days) for a good, fresh-cooked breakfast with delicious home-made bread. Easy walk to Playa Norte and dozens of good small eateries (I loved Poc Chuc the most).  Juarez is a block from Hidalgo, the main tourist street with all the night life, but the noise never bothered me. Definitely recommend.",50,676
"Our stay at Elements of the Island was incredible! The room was extremely clean and was maintained by a wonderful housekeeper who even changed our bedding half way through the stay.  The air conditioning worked very well and we only had to use it to cool down in the evening before bed.  The bed was so comfortable! Our host was extremely accommodating and gracious, helping us feel at home immediately.   He speaks excellent English and really helped us navigate many aspects of the trip.  The Elements of the Island cafe became one of our favorite places to eat on the island with reasonable prices and great food.  We will most definitely be back and stay at Elements of the Island!",50,676
Elements of the Island is a wonderful hotel to stay !!! They serve breakfast downstairs and have have housekeeping. In the room there is a T.V. two beds (one big one small) a balcony a tiny kitchen and a bathroom with a shower.They also have 3 air conditioners that are not broken !!!   Thank you Madjid for a wonderful and great stay at Elements of the Island!!! ,50,676
"Elements of the Island is a fantastic option if you want to have an authentic, pleasant, well rounded experience in Isla Mujeres.   It is nice and central, only a block or two away from everything you need.   Benefits: - The breakfast downstairs is exceptional. We tried lots of things and they were all delicious. It’s also very well priced for travellers on a budget and the service is really good.  - Beach chairs and umbrellas are there to be used for free. This will save you lots of money as the ones on the beach are $350 pesos each. Beach towels are also provided and changed daily/as needed.  - The apartments are really clean, well kept and quiet. Even with the nightclub next door and the Main Street one over it was so quiet at night. Granted we were there when it was much",50,676
 less busy but still we found it really quiet and a nice place to have a siesta.  - Golf cart rental is really close and $850 pesos for the day! - There isn’t a view of the sea but you’ll get an epic view of a thunder and lightening storm! - it’s really secure. There’s a locked gate to get into the complex and also separate key for room doors.  - the air conditioning is really good. There’s also a fan and ceiling fan to move the air around if you don’t want air con on.  - bed is really big and on the harder side but real comfy al the same. -The host Madjid is lovely and helpful and always happy to assist with how much things should cost like taxis or food.  If we go back to Isla Mujeres  we will definitely stay here again :) ,50,676

"Great location, we booked a king room with balcony on the top floor which opened onto the shared terrace .  Lovely spacious room with a massive shower.  You collect keys via a key safe at the front door but your fantastic host ""Jo""  was there if you did need anything.  Location is in the heart of the night life area so either party or take ear plugs.",50,677
"My boyfriend and I are not super high maintenance when it comes to our trips, so if you are then this probably isn't the place for you.  But anyway, the room is adorable, pretty colors, suprisingly spacious, concrete floors.  The bathroom was said to be tiny, but we didn't have a problem with it.  The shower water would leak through the glass and wet our bathroom floors and lead to the room, but again this didn't bother us. Just wipe it up with some towels and you're good!  We had a cute little balcony that overlooked the town.  There's also a stairway that leads to a rooftop patio where you can see over the town, lots of places to sit, and there's even a room with sunscreen, snacks, glasses for water and mugs for tea and coffee, a water dispenser (you can't drink from the taps",50,677
" in Mexico), and other things. There is no continental breakfast, but my boyfriend and I are late risers so this wasn't a problem.  The important thing to mention is that this place is in the heart of downtown so at nights it gets LOUD.  Bring noise-cancelling earplugs to sleep and you'll be fine.  I slept like a baby most nights and I'm a light sleeper. Another thing to mention is you are right above a restraunt that is always playing music. And they start playing early. Last, but not least, the lady that helped us out was WONDERFUL! Her name was Jo and she helped organize all our excursions.  She even got a couples massage arranged for our room.  My boyfriend lost the key to our room on the last night and Jo was very helpful and understanding in getting that sorted.  She was always a text or a phone call away.  It was very nice.  On the first day she even gave us complimentary drinks from the hotel bar downstairs.",40,677

"This is not a hotel, this is a boutique hotel so you will not likely see staff, you get keys to the front door and to your suite. This place was so cute and oozing with character. We stayed in the Chiapas suite. The rooms are accessible to the left of the Tres Mentiras bar. Our stay came with a free welcome drink which was lovely. The manager was amazing and extremely accommodating.   This place has a narrow staircase and low doorways when you enter, so make sure you can walk up steep steps. There aren't too many steps its just a tight fit.  The room was divided into two rooms, the living room and bedroom. There was a bathroom off of each room. The shower was located in the ensuite bathroom which was really stylish and comfortable. The decor in the room was very tasteful and",50,677
" totally representative of the island and Mexico in general. There were two air conditioners that were not too bad, but could have been better. There is a cute sitting area and there is a little fridge to keep extra drinks or food cold. There was a little closet in the bedroom to hang up your stuff.  Now, this next part has nothing to do with the place itself, but in general it is a loud place to be because there are bars and restaurants all over the island. It will be loud at night regardless of where you stay. The bed was comfortable but the sheets could have been a little cleaner. The rest of the space was very clean. There was a rooftop area where you could hang out, the two top rooms are located up there as well. There was a water dispenser but it wasn't always full, which was totally fine. There were some complimentary teas upstairs as well.   The location is amazing and you have access to bars, restaurants, cafes, shops and the beach in all directions!",50,677

"My wife and I came back for another stay at Tres Mentiras Boutique Rooms at the end of April.   We were arriving early, and Jo, the property manager, helped us get our luggage secure and coordinated check in.   The hotel has a great location right on Hidalgo, so plenty of restaurants and bars within a quick walk.  And Playa Norte is just a few minutes away.  We always enjoy the people watching and street entertainment from the balcony.  The ""Yucatan"" room is clean and comfortable.  The staff at the hotel and restaurant below are helpful and friendly.   Jo even assisted us in planning a romantic sunset dinner at the Mayan Beach Club on the last night of our trip.  We've stayed in several different locations on Isla from condos to houses right on the beach.  But this charming",50,677
 boutique hotel in the center of town is certainly one of our favorite places.,50,677

Things were going well till the last day of our trip.  My wife and I came back from breakfast to find items missing from our room and room service had just finished up. I spoke with the hotel manager and he shared that it's been an issue... there you have it! They know what's going on and are OK with it... we'll never stay here or recommend someone else to.,10,678
"Me and my husband spend now the Christmas holiday in Isla Mujeres. We choose the hotel because of the beautiful view we saw on the pictures...indeed, the views are stunning, but everything else is truly dissapointing. We observed on our 3rd day in the morning that a reasonable amount of EUR cash was STOLEN from the LOCKED room safe... we have literally traveled the world but nothing like this ever happened to us. The staff and hotel manager seemingly did not care, not even once were we informed after reporting the stealing about their ""investigation"" whatsoever. Huge dissapointment, also despite the stealing a dirty, stinky, poor quality place. Please don't be so fool like we were and AVOID this hotel.",10,678
"This hotel is very basic.  For the price and location it's worth it though if you can get past a few things.  Definitely not luxury. The check-in process was simple and staff was decently helpful.  The location is the best part.  It is on the coast with a rocky/cliff view of the ocean which is very beautiful.  It is within walking distance of Playa Norte, the ferry, and everything downtown.  There is no fridge, the drinkable water is located in the hallway, there are no wash clothes or a hair dryer.  When I say basic, I mean basic.  Basic isn't bad don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting.   The included breakfast was odd.  There was no menu and no one explained what was included.  We got the same thing two days in a row and when we asked for something else they said",30,678
" it'd cost, okay no big deal to pay a little extra for something different.  We ate breakfast out the rest of our stay though.  The Mexican eggs that they served were good though.  A few good experiences: we couldn't figure out our AC and someone came to check it out very promptly.  We had a later ferry off the island and they allowed us to store our luggage past check out time in a secured room.  We met some other guests that were very nice by the pool and community area was great.  LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.  Walking distance of everything we wanted was awesome.  We did rent a golf cart for 24 hours to explore the island.   A few bad things: our water went out one night and the toilet wouldn't flush and water wouldn't.  It was very late at night but when I went to tell the front desk no one was there.  It came back on in the morning.  Also, we had overhead lights/fans but could never get the lights to come on, but fans would work.  Then, in the middle of the night they randomly came on.  The photos of this property show a restaurant in it and there currently is not one.  It appears that there maybe was one or is going to be one.  There was a lot of construction and maintenance going on when were there.",30,678

"This hotel is not for everyone; please research before booking.  I booked a double room with a balcony and “sea view. “   Pros: The staff was very kind and welcoming. Large room with two beds, seating area, closet, and spacious balcony. Great location, close to the port ( ferry), approximately 5-8 minute walk, walking distance to multiple restaurants and the beach. The Isla Mujeres sign ( popular photo spot) is located right outside the hotel. The staff was delightful but spoke very little English. It’s ok since I don’t speak Spanish either, but communication was difficult. Staff will arrange for covid testing to be done in the room for a return to the US. The rapid covid test resulted in 5 minutes, and the doctor sent an email with results within a couple of hours.   The room",40,678
"I stayed here 1 night but was charged for 3. I called them but they say I stayed there for three which is a BIG FAT LIE. After that, they ignore my emails and my calls. Other reasons why you should NOT stay in this hotel: - No Safe. - No outside curtains so I had to wake up early as the sun hit my face. - Only one employee for the whole hotel - No amenities - When I arrived, there was no one in the lobby, then he didn't even say hi. - No elevator - Rooms are very small - TV has no channels. * Don't waste your time and your vacation time. Go to another Hotel.",10,679
"Awful hotel that did not match with the official photos so very disappointed. Bathroom was filthy and moldy, not in a good shape. Room was ok and windows with no views. Try another option if you stay on the island. No real receptionist so doors are full open to the outside. This is not a boutique hotel",10,679
"We love this place but it is a lil noisy when you decide to travel around Christmastime, this place is right across from the ferry terminal. Our breakfast at the hotel was tasty and different form the 4/5 days we were there. Staff was very friendly, helpful and hotel was very clean, not your plush 5 star, but this is our thing!! Absolutely worth referring and returning to.",50,680
The hotel is a four story hotel with no elevator and narrow stairs.  It is directly across from the ferry port and is convenient to the downtown area.  Playa Norte beach is walking distance from the hotel.  Great restaurants and bars are also within walking distance. The best rooms are 104 and 204.  These rooms has a balcony and are at the front of the building-good views of harbor.  The a/c units are not great but they do cool the room.  There is no safe in the room.  There is a refrigerator and a tv that has  basic cable reception.  The beds are not the most comfortable.  The mattresses should be replaced.   Frank the manager is great and has great knowledge of the island.  This was the second time we have stayed here.  The last time was in 2008.  I would still recommend this,30,680

"This is our second stay at Hotel D'Gomar. The location is excellent as it is directly across from the ferry terminal.  Playa Central & Norte are just a short stroll away. The town centre is two blocks away. There is always someone at the front desk to help you. At night, the front door is locked for security and there is a night watchman. It is a bit noisy during the day with all the traffic, but if you sit on the deck and people watch it's quite entertaining. The rooms are clean, comfortable & spacious. Two beds, clean bathroom & large shower, flat screen TV and fridge. No safe but there is a lock drawer for valuables. Only a few hangers??? We had six in our room, asked for more and ten arrived in minutes. The staff is very accommodating. We enjoyed the breakfast service each",20,680
" day. Mexican style cooking great everyday.The Gomar is not the Ritz so don't expect that. What you will get is a great hotel & staff that will treat you like part of their Mexican family if you allow them to. Engage the staff, speak a little Spanish. Don't be an arrogant ars. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Thank you Frank and staff for another great experience at Hotel D'Gomar! We will be back.",40,680

"The hotel is a clean budget hotel with a nice breakfast, although sometimes the breakfast was not warm. It is located across the street from the ferry so it is easy to get there, and is in a great location for beach and restaurants. However, there is no room safe, and no place to put your close except for a couple of hangers. There is no elevator and the stairs are pretty narrow. Because it is close to a main Street, it is a bit noisy. ",40,680
"It is right in front of the port on the main street, so it's quite noisey. Rooms are clean, but the building is disappointing. There is nothing really wrong in this place, but i think you can find something better in Isla mujeres for the price.",30,680
Our stay at the hotel was in some ways better than expected given the price we paid. We were fortunate in that our room was only one flight up as the hotel does not have an elevator. We have been staying in luxury accommodations in general and where trying to economize by staying here. The things that we missed the most was no safe and no shelves or dresser. We started out with 8 hangers but I broke one by putting four shirts on the hanger. On the positive side the included breakfast was quite nice with fresh cut fruit and either eggs or a ham and cheese Mexican kind of thing. The room has an air conditioner and a flat screen TV along with a nice size refrigerator. The bathroom is modern and the whole room is very clean. The beds are comfortable and the sheets are not abrasive.,40,680
"Quaint accommodations in the heart of Centro!  Very clean rooms, some more spacious than others, and you will have everything you need -- but if you need anything else, just ask (like blankets or beach towels)!  Nothing like having your morning coffee on the rooftop, overlooking the port and surrounding area.  Just two blocks away from Av. Hidalgo and great restaurants and shopping.  Playa Norte is an easy 10 minute walk.  Truly a gem!",40,681

"Right in the heart of the north end and walking distance from the ferry terminal. Cheap no frills rooms with great views of the bay and beach. Walk across street and you are at the beach. Walk 2 blocks in the opposite direction and you are on the street with all the restaurants and shops. Great for an evening stroll and dinner.  Roof top patio is great. Great views, great breeze, and a barbeque grill.",40,681

We were 4 people and we got a room with 3 beds (one king size and two queens size) a small equipped kitchen, 2 comfortable chair and  small dining table. there was not a lot of room in the room because all of the furniture.  bathroom was pretty small and it took time for the hot water to work. The Wi-Fi was very slow and didn't work for small parts of the day.  The rooftop is amazing!! We hung up there for hours almost every day of our visit. There is up there a small kitchen and a shower hose.  The staff was very kind and helpful, do to the fact that there in English was poor, they were very nice and kind. they cleaned our room every day. ",40,681
"The Sol Caribe is a unique hotel and quirky hotel in the heart of Isla Mujeres.  Upon arriving on the street in front of the alley way to the entrance, you are greeted with a mild to mid-range aroma of raw sewage. This greeting continued throughout our 4 night stay.

We were greeted with a very friendly concierge with limited English. But we were able to communicate.

For being right in the thick of things in Isla, the second you step off the busy street on to the property things are quiet. We loved being just minutes away from everything and was so handy to rent bikes and golf carts when we wanted to head to the other end of the island.

It's located above Rolandi's which is an amazing spot and has been open for over 30 years. Each night the staff was sweet since they knew I was staying in the hotel. They remembered my name and my wine of choice each night. I got room #21 which is the best. It's on the 3rd floor which is probably why I had less problems with the noise. It's an old hotel but super clean. Each day they cleaned my room. Great Ac and it was perfect for exactly what I wanted. It's in a perfect central spot of downtown. This was recommended to me by a local. There are no frills to this hotel but I felt super safe and comfortable at night and it's not crowded,50,682

"If you enjoy very loud Mexican club techno house music thumping the walls 16 hours a day (8am-12am), don’t like to sleep much and love taking cold showers, this is your place. We were supposed to get the large deluxe family room and was told it wasn’t available when we arrived even though we were the only people staying at the hotel. They don’t have beach towels to take to the beach. The room was fairly clean, bed was comfortable and ac worked well. Will NOT be staying here again and DO NOT recommend it. We booked another hotel for the last night of our vacation because we couldn’t stand one more day of the head exploding booming techno music from downstairs. Horrible place.",30,682

"We got to Isla and the place we had booked was horrid, so we sought out a new hotel for our 3 nights there.  One of the store owners near by took us to this place and we were able to secure a king size room,  We loved it it was clean and we had a balcony overlooking the street and a second one into Rolandis restaurant.  They were very accommodating and got us a mini fridge for our room and offered a 10% discount for the attached restaurant..  We got to watch the action from our balcony at night.  Yes there is noise but nothing horrible and we just went with it for the overall experience.  Wifi was spotty but whatever if u are on the Island go explore don't hang out in your room playing on wifi.  Would recommend, ask for a front facing room with a balcony if u can  Thank you for",10,682

"Hotel Belmar is a small hotel on hidalgo street. The location is great, and the rooms are clean and comfortable but the rooms are located above an open courtyard that contains a restuarant. Noise begins at 530am and ends at about 1230am. We could handle the noise until 1230 but it seems that the staff have no regard for hotel guests when arriving in the morning. Out of 5 nights, we were woke 4 nights from about 430 or 5. The restuarants dishwasher was located below our room, when the staff went home for the night they turned it on, and when it finished it beeped constantly until the staff returned the next morning. The morning staff also played the radio and talked loudly while moving furniture around.  All the noise really ruins the reputation of what could be a great hotel.",30,682

"We stayed at the hotel from 1\26 to 2\3 2022. Our room was clean and comfortable. The bed was very low to the ground but comfortable. The bathroom was out dated but clean and useable. The shower is small but the water was hot, the lighting in the bathroom was very dim. Just an FYI, There are no English television stations and theFree internet works best in the lobby and by the pool. Our room was on the 3rd floor and there is no elevator, but the you man did help us with our bags. Check in was quick and easy, our room was ready when we Checked in and we were early. Great location.Show",40,684
"Great place! I stayed here my first time to Isla and it was perfect! Clean rooms, free Wi-Fi, breakfast(eggs, fruit, toast, cereal) included from 8-11am, AC(if you want it), TV in room, safe, mini-fridge, balcony(not all rooms) and very friendly staff. I also liked that they provided a few waters daily for whatever you need, very nice touch. Just a few blocks away from the ferry terminal, minutes from Hildago street and a quick walk to north beach. Would definitely stay here again and will be coming back.",50,684
This was a very last minute choice as we arrived on a Friday and waited till after 5 pm to start looking for a room (I don’t ever recommend this but even worse idea on a small island beginning of weekend lol) So we scooted around and looked for places to ask about occupancy. My gf got off and ran in. She misunderstood the woman at the desk and we decided to just grab this room because it was “cheap” and available however when we checked in it was more than we expected. $100 usd with no view.  It was downtown and the staff is very friendly. The hotel itself is very dated but with a kind of quinton terentino charm. It did the trick,30,684
"It is the 3rd time to be here. A real pleasure to be guest at Berny. Nice, clean and safe room. Good breakfast every morning made by a good chef. The front desk amazing. Polite, helpful,  and always friendly.  I recommend even in this crazy time for everybody to take your time and go in vacation and book at Berny, Isla Mujeres.  Certainly I will be back. Thank you, Hotel Berny.",50,684
"Tried to get confirmation on booking , but no reply till I couldn't wait any longer. I booked through a friend at another place to stay. When I finally received a reply I was disappointed in the price increase. Is it worth  the new prices? Well visiting friends there, there seems to be an increasing disappointment at the premises. Wifi is very spotty. Tv channels are few and no english stations. I love the staff there but unfortunately management seems dysfunctional . Even met patrons who don't  even know the prices their paying. Way over priced sorry wont book there till they get sorted.  Having stayed at the old Vistalmar and the Berny I would say I enjoyed the Vistalmar experience much more.

"The hotel is in a great location, a couple of blocks from the ferry terminal and a couple of blocks to Playa Norte beaches. The hotel is very clean and the free breakfast is a nice added feature.The rooms we had was nice with a balcony, daily water, fridge, in room safe, and most importantly one of the most comfortable beds in Mexico. The staff are very good, I don't have everyone's name but a shoutout to Erik at the front desk, Alfonso and Ivan the waiters and Lotius the cook. also the cleaning lady was top notch. If you are a light sleeper make sure that you are not staying in the rooms over the bar, Stingray, as it can be loud until 4 in the morning.",50,684
"Rooms have been recently remodeled, very nice. Grounds are well kept. Staff is extremely accommodating and helpful. The breakfast, which is included is very good with several choices of eggs or pancakes with fruit and toast also available. The egg dishes are cooked to order as this hotel features its own little cafe and bar. I worked while we were there, I have my own hot spot as the Internet was not very strong in many locations including the room.",40,684
Would return. Extremely nice group of people working here. Was given the room I needed. Balcony with street view.. Upgraded to larger room after a drainage problem.  They are hooked up to the new system so paper is allowed to be flushed. A plus for visitors to Isla.  The beds and linen were great as was the cleaning . T.V was all Spanish except for one channel in early evening. WiFi was good in coradors. Loaded my devise then read in room. Our room was directly over the corner bar. We enjoyed their music while on balcony. Didn’t hear at all when balcony door was shut.  Check out the Argentine Bakery accost the street  The breakfast was very good and included in price. They also serve other meals here along with cocktails.   Thank you Hotel Berny!  Enjoyed very much,50,684
"As the title specifies, why is this a $95 USD per night hotel? Almost 2000 pesos a night?? Carmelina's across the street is 600 pesos a night for 90% of the same thing?  Confused after 2 visits to this hotel & 22 years visiting Isla Mujeres. It's NOT bad , but NOT worth 2000 pesos. Maybe 800 pesos.",30,685
"Run by one of the best families who welcomes you like they have known you forever.  Prime location, clean rooms, warm shower, comfy spacious beds, and decorated down to every last detail.

Third time I have stayed here in room #15. Small kitchen with fridge toaster microwave. View of the Carribean side. Clean rooms simple. 6 blocks from the beautiful North Beach. One block from Caribe side. Small coffee shop across the street. Laundry on the corner. Grocery store 3 blocks. Excellent restaurants 1-2 blocks.,50,685
"A nice quaint, clean hotel that should cost about $50.00 usd a night, NOT 70...a bit crazy on the price considering the amenities, shower pressure, road noise & slow internet ...Better than the all inclusives, but still??",30,685
"I stayed here with a friend for 4 nights. Had room #9 with 2 double beds. We checked out the room before we checked in. It's old but clean. You pay in advance for our stay as per Hotel policy. There is a no-refund policy also. We brought our things to the room and sat on the bed- it was like sitting on concrete. The sheets are so thin you can see right through to the mattress.No matress cover.  Pillows are old and hard- sheets did not even match. We requested to change rooms hoping the beds would be better, they did not have any available tell the next day. Ended up switching to room #7 with a king bed. We we're willing to sleep in the same one in hopes that the bed would be better. It was not  It did have a mattress cover however so it seemed the slightest bit softer. Hot",20,685
" water is also not reliable. For over $100 a night there are better places.  Owners are nice, Courtyard is cute but the beach on this side is not swimmable so you can walk down and look at it that's about it.",20,685

"We stayed at Francis Arlene for a week while in Isla Mujeres and will not be back.  The pros:  It is cheap, close to Hildago Ave and close to the beach.  The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very clean.  Housekeeping did a good job each day of keeping the room nice.  The AC worked well.  The cons:  This hotel is VERY old and everything in it is equally old.  The bedspread had stains and holes and appeared VERY old.  We did not have a TV or working refrigerator in our room.  The shower had very little water pressure and only enough hot water for one person to shower very quickly.  The first day we arrived there were not towels at all.  We asked for towels and were told we would get them on the second day, so we weren't able to shower the first day.  Our toilet flusher broke",50,685
" and was not working and I told the front desk.  They said they would send someone up right away to fix it, however, 2 days later it still wasn't fixed and we had to take the back of the tank lid off to fix it.  Wifi was spotty at best.    I would also advise you do not get any sort of shampoo, conditioner or soap at this hotel so make sure you bring your own.  Also, you will need to bring a hairdryer because that is also not provided.  If you want a cheap, clean place to stay with absolutely nothing else to offer, you will be fine here.  If you have any expectations at all, I would find somewhere else.",40,685

"The room was well equipped, staff was perfect!  It can get a bit loud (traffic), I'm a light sleeper, a pair of earplugs worked great!  Bar/restaurant a few steps away from my room, as well as a great pool!",50,687
One of the best meals on my trip!  I was surprised at the mixed reviews.  My expectations were not high but I was blown away by the shrimp Mac and cheese. It was fantastic as  was my margarita. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food took awhile but it was delicious and fresh so I didn’t mind the wait.  The other 3 in my group enjoyed their meals as well.,40,687
Fish and chips were a joke.     Could hardly distinguish any shrimp in the Shrimp tacos.    Could have been ground Turkey or minced shrimp because all you could taste was the hot pepper sauce.     Couldn’t even finish one.     Drinks were meh.   ,20,687
"This place is so much fun. We had the best tacos of our whole trip here. The bartender Justin made some pretty amazing mojitos. Location is great, right on the water. Also just minutes from downtown. Staff is very friendly. You can tell that management really cares. Highly recommend  Damon M",50,687
No service. Waited over 15 minutes with no acknowledgement.  Prices on menu are were ridiculous. Left for any other place. Service sucks very rude don’t like Americans at this bar with service and cold beer. ,10,687
"Wonderful find on the perfect spot mid island. Skulls has a gorgeous property with a pool, bar and restaurant, and a pier out over the water. Chris Fausel keeps things running smoothly and makes sure guests are well taken care of. You won't find a better deal on Isla! ",50,687
Outrageously dishonest.   Bartender brought us a bill at the end of the night for 2 Margaritas that was TRIPLE what we expected.   He knew full well we thought it was Happy Hour when we ordered but he claimed we’d missed it by 4 minutes.   Didn’t tell us that when we were ordering though. And their regular price was 50% higher than anywhere we’ve seen. And by far the worst Margaritas we’ve had on the Island. Orange juice instead of Cointreau.  On top of that he charged us for a drink we sent back because it wasn’t what we asked for. He kept the drink we returned and charged us for it anyway.  The he conveniently waited to bring us the bill til the other friendly tables around us had left so no one would witness our outrage and take them to task.  Sleazy.  Hope they’re enjoying,10,687

"Staff is completely uninterested and rude.  The rooms have zero isolation and the place and its neighboring bars play ridiculously loud and conflicting music all day.  The music is even worse because of its unbelievably bad sound quality, it stutters and squeaks regularly. Seems they play way louder than their installation can handle.",10,688
"I can’t say enough good things.  We had a large group of family that rented the majority of the rooms.  The rooms were cleaned daily, staff were friendly.  Rooms aren’t fancy but we were not in the rooms except to shower and sleep. A microwave and coffee maker was suggested for all rooms. They were receptive to that suggestion and hope they will be there for our next stay.  The food at the bar and grill on site was amazing!  Still thinking about those steak burritos. Yum!!   Servers & bartenders were top notch!!  They were very attentive while we were beached for the day.  We had kids with us of all ages and it was fun,  safe, and they loved it!  Can’t wait to return!!",50,688
"The price: My credit card was overcharged for the room and the hotel refuses to refund me the difference for the price I booked. I booked through hotels.com with a free cancelation up until the day prior to check-in. 2 weeks prior to check-in, I canceled 3 days of my original 7 day stay. Instead of canceling the 3 days I requested, the hotel rebooked my stay under a new higher rate and will not refund the difference basically making my stay the same price for 4 days as it was for 7. I didn't immediately notice this due to the charges at the hotel being in Mexican Pesos. hotels.com said I had to discuss it with the hotel, hotel refuses to fix this.  The room: This room is basic, definitely NOT 4 stars. There was loud construction going on from 7am-7pm (see pics). There are no",10,688
" washcloths or beach towels for guests. The office is difficult to find and there is rarely anyone there. There is no table in the room. You have to carry your luggage through the sand to get to the room. Wifi is not reliable. There is no bottled water or coffee maker in the room as advertised.  The location: The only good thing about this place is the location. Do yourself a favor and just walk to the beach instead of staying at the this hotel. I was asked to pay for a chair and umbrella even though I was staying at the hotel. After I explained that I was a guest, I got the side-eye and they walked away.",50,688

"Stayed here on a week tour of Yucatan. 2 nights to see tbe whale sharks. Located on North beach, its a great location with a great view. You walk a sandy path to get to the entrance, which is not marked. You walk by  lot of trash ( which is piled high everywhere in the island)Check in is beside a bar...dank and dark.  Was really happy with view but in morning no place for coffee or breakfast...wifi does not work in room...fridge is on the floor..no coffee maker in room. There is trash around the stairwell to get to your room  and sand is everywhere....all day the party boats from  Cancun park in front of resort and blast music until sundown.  Attached photo is of stairwell area and top of palapa below us.",10,688
"The location is the only thing that can save this place..dont expect bottled water in your room..no coffee maker, fridge to keep your liquids cool,no extra towels,pillows, blankets even if you ask..no safe for your valuables or free breakfast as advertised..and make sure you get your chairs early because they will rent them out to people not staying at the hotel..also they offer covid test for 80usd but I recommend going to the ferry to get them done for 30usd",30,688
"We booked this hotel for 3 nights and couldn’t stay longer than two. It’s very poorly managed. We had to search for the front office and someone to check us in.  Finally the restaurant staff took pity on us and showed us the “back room” in the restaurant to check in. The music from the beach was way too loud into the wee hours of the morning making it impossible to sleep. The hotel rooms are equipped very poorly. No bottled water, no extra towels, no phone, or any extras.  There is no wi-fi in the rooms. This hotel dramatically lowers the standards for such a nice location and doesn’t belong there. If you stay there you will be greatly disappointed and will have overpaid.",50,688
"First the good:  - Great location, right on the North beach - Nice big rooms  The bad  - Despite what they say there is no WiFi. You can't get any in the rooms (you can see some hot spots but they are not theirs). There is wifi at the bar but it never worked...and they didn't see to care. This made it a nightmare for those of us who needed to work, or watch some Netflix before bed.  - The curtains are office style blinds that have big gaps in them. Not good for privacy. Many times I had people glancing in!! - Bit of building work. There was hammering during the day and even people mixing cement at 10pm",40,688
"Large room, cleaned daily. RIGHT ON THE BEACH. close to everything.  Large smart T.V. (didn't use) to busy outside.  We stayed in #8. Hot Water,  The Hotel could use better Beach Lounge Chairs.  The people of Isla Mujures are warm and friendly and welcome you with smiles,  ",10,688
"Great safe, clean hotel for  short stay. Great location in centro, great balcony to people watch from. Very close to 2 beaches, playa norte (gorgeous) & a quieter beach that only locals use (although red flag so cant swim there) short walk from ferry too.  Modern & fairly new i would say. Smart tv with option to log into your netflix account which i thought was a nice touch for a hotel in this price range. Fridge & safe too & decent shower. Dont get breakfast but nice place downstairs to grab coffee & breakfast.  Staff were nice they let me check in early & looked after my luggage till i could. Felt very safe there as a solo traveller, highly recommend.",50,689
"I needed a budget trip to Mexico and had been to Isla a few times. I chose this hotel because of the location I was familiar with and knew it would be safe and lots nearby. Going in I knew it would be pretty basic but it was very clean and I felt safe there. They have a metal door they lock at 11pm. Of course there is a guard to let you in if you are a guest. The young man who was almost always at the front desk seemed to even be sort of looking out for me.  They loan out beach towels. It was never very loud even being by several bars and restaurants. Most places close at 11 so not a problem.  Location couldn't be better if you can't afford beachfront and as a woman by myself, I always felt safe. If you don't need luxury I would recommend.",40,689
Prima hotel. Aardig personeel. Top locatie. In de avond wat luidruchtig maar dat wisten we van te voren. Midden aan de leukste straat (Miquel Hidalgo). Prijzen van het hotel zijn niet in verhouding maar dat heeft natuurlijk alles te maken met vraag en aanbod op dit moment. Supermarkt zit direct naast het hotel.,30,689
Excelente lugar centrico a 3 cuadras del ferry a 4 cuadras de playa norte a 4 cuadras de playa mía y a 2 cuadras de playa céntrica Habitación amplia con heladera pequeñas airé y tv. supermetcado aki  a 1 cuadra  Buena limpieza y personal atento Sin ruido por estar en el centro aunque la actividad termina a las 23 Excelente relación precio calidad Volvería sin dudarlo,50,689
"Un hotel que definitivamente supera las expectativas, cómodo con una temática especial. Un buen lugar para pasar una estancia romántica. Incluye el desayuno continental en Marina Bartolomé y sin duda el servicio de Kathia, es el mejor. Volveremos.",50,690
"We have stayed at Casa Barco twice and it has been a great experience both times. The rooms are incredibly clean and spacious. There is a shared kitchen area for the 5 rooms in the house that has everything you need and space to keep food in the refrigerator. They clean your room daily, including clean towels and bed sheets. There is a shared pool on the upper floor of the house that is a great place to relax after a day touring or at the beach. Great location to the north beach and the Hidalgo Avenue, the main shopping and restaurant street. This is a really nice, clean place to stay. We are planning our next trip to return!",50,690
"Buena opción para hospedarse en isla, cada habitación tiene su propia decoración, cuenta con cocina/comedor donde puedes preparar tus alimentos, con refrigerador y todo lo necesario para cocinar. Todo limpio, internet rápido. El personal muy atento, Kathia, siempre al pendiente y amable.  El único detalle, que seguramente está referido, pero no leí, para ingresar, hay varias escaleras, así que si sufres del alguna discapacidad, o carriolas, etc, hay que considerarlo. De ahí en más, excelente ubicación, muy recomendable.",50,690
Très jolie chambre confortable dans une grande maison partagée. Idéalement placé à 5min des bars et restaurants et du terminal de ferry. Eau potable à disposition dans la cuisine partagée qui permet de faire son petit déjeuner soit même car l’hôtel ne le propose pas.,50,690
"Pasamos una noche en Isla Mujeres y elegimos este hotel por su situación y precio, la verdad que no defraudó. La habitación limpia y las chicas de recepción muy amables. Está a 10min andando de Playa Norte, cerca de muchos restaurantes y tiendas. Repetiríamos sin dudarlo!",40,690
"Este hotel es una excelente opción si quieres tener un buen lugar, céntrico, y a un buen precio !! Está a una calle de ferry, a dos cuadras de la calle en donde están las artesanías y restaurantes y a pocas cuadras de la hermosa playa norte!! La decoración es muy muy linda y la habitación con espacio suficiente!! La cama y almohadas cómodas !! El único “detalle” es que no cuenta con restaurante o servicios, pero la verdad si vas a conocer la isla, no resulta necesario . Tienen convenio con una alquiladora de carritos de golf . La atención del personal fue lo mejor !! ",40,690
"I booked a private room with bathroom. It was very spacious and had fridge, TV, AC, hangers, table with chairs, glasses and cups etc The sheets are super soft. The water pressure is great! There is hot water right away! I could here music from the street in the evening but it didn’t bother me. In the night it’s quiet! The hotel is on the main street with restaurants and shops. Beach is 5min away by foot and there is a supermarket 2 blocks from here. Can really recommend!",50,691
"This small hotel is located in the centre of a busy pedestrian zone but our room never noticed much noise. The room was small but clean, staff were helpful and friendly and wifi was available in the room. There is no restaurant or cafe attached to the hotel but there are many options within meters of the hotel that serve great food and good entertainment.  We took a taxi from the ferry but it really is only a 10 minute walk if you take your time, as the hotel is in a pedestrian area you still need to walk a few hundred meters from where you are dropped. When leaving we asked the manager to organise us a “trailer-bicycle” to carry our luggage to the port and we walked alongside. ",40,691
Right downtown so that  we could walk to everything from the ferry to North Beach and to shopping and restaurants. Staff was very helpful. Small place but clean and had refrigerator and table...and they provided other items upon request like hair dryer and toaster and snorkeling equipment. It was very good for price. We only missed an outdoor place to sit and it was little noisy at night till about 11pm.,40,691
"We wanted a short getaway in Isla Mujeres and accommodation that would be comfortable without breaking the bank. This place did the trick. Our room was big and comfy and had a cute balcony overlooking busy Hidalgo street. Bathroom was clean. There is a fridge in the room (a bit noisy) and a coffeemaker which gets replenished every day. The AC worked really well and was very quiet. There is no common space for use in the posada but at this price, who cares? Staff was helpful and let us drop our bags before check in time. Playa Norte and the ferry are a two-minute walk away. We would totally stay at this place again.",50,691
Stayed a few days last weekend. Very simple but a perfect fit for our needs. Stayed in posada 8. Little balcony overlooking Hidalgo. Very friendly staff. Would stay there again. Had difficulty booking for a Sunday checkout but a little tweaking to their website on their end and it worked great. Easy to email and communicate.,40,691
"I spent two nights and found it Ok but definitely overpriced. 50 Eur seems like a lot for a simple room - but then again, Isla Mujeres is probably one of the most expensive places in Mexico. I like the silent AC, the decent WiFi and having fridge in the room. Also, the location is central and still surprisingly quiet. I did not like the high price so much (this was a last minute booking and I didn't seem to have much choice at booking.com) and the fact that they make up the rooms between 15:00 and 16:00 - the time of my siesta.",30,691
"We needed a room for the night and this was perfect. We had a room on the 1st floor, simple yet clean. A shower/bath, bed TV, mini fridge, table and chairs, and air conditioning. The room was clean - what more did we need and only $55.  We would rent here again. Thank you",40,691
"I was really impressed with the cleanliness of this place, the room and bathroom were both spotless and the room was well equipped with.... wait for it... (this almost never happens in Mexico) - QUIET air conditioning!  Clean linen and towels in good condition, a large size fridge, comfortable bed and pillows.  Yeah I guess the room was kind of 'internal' with a strange window looking out to I'm not sure what (they had a curtain behind it) but it was still well lit and did not at all feel claustrophobic.  If you're traveling on a budget I can't recommend this place enough.  Wifi works for the most part including in the room.  The service is good and they will store your bags behind the office and honestly it's so quiet it's safe.  Amazing location right in the heart of Isla",50,691
" Mujeres without being noisy.  They don't have a card machine so you need to pay in cash for your stay else they offer paypal.  Cute and quaint with a boutique feel, so much nicer than a chain hotel!",40,691

"The husband and I booked a studio room for our 2 week stay on Isla Mujeres. Being a regular on the island i had a good idea of whats available and what to expect. This hotel is the perfect little oasis in the center. The hotel is close to all attractions within walking distance but still quiet and safe with a gorgeous tropical garden.   We had the top floor studio that was spacious, clean with lots of sunshine coming from all sides. Oscar and Cassandra were very welcoming and spoke good english. We choose this hotel in part because they had a pool on the premises but its run down and not so appealing. But at the end it didnt bother us much. Overall we would definately stay at Isla Caracol again on our next trip",40,692
"The hotel is well located to bars, beach and restaurants. I also felt quite safe and the room was clean. Having the mini-frig was convenient but the hotel offers no coffee.  They only provided two bath towels per room. No hand towels, washcloths were available. The few hangers and lack of hooks was also something they could easily remedy. I would also suggest having more than one mirror in the room as the only mirror was a small one over the sink.  Little things could vastly improve this establishment which could take it from too basic to comfy for a minimal price.",40,692
"I stayed in Isla Caracol after ages of trawling through places on booking apps. So glad I decided to stay here. The staff are so amazing. Especially Yvette (Yvette, un dia espero que vayas a India !). The breakfast is pretty basic but does the job. The rooms are really nice. It is a nice chilled place and only 10 mins walk to playa azul. All the main restaurants and shops are close by. I would definitely stay here again. ",50,692
We normally stay all inclusive and 5 star properties. Wanting to visit Isla Mujeres for my wife's 50th birthday on a budget we did our first not all in for decades. My wife wasn't keen on a airbnb yet wanted to dip toes in stages by booking a hotel. We were attempting a budget Trip. Air Miles to get here flights. CanaDian transfers met us at airport to shuttle to ferry and we arrived downtown. The locals wanted taxi money gave us bad directions walking blocks. In reality this place is leave the ferry terminal turning left and 1 block up at oxxo convenience store turn right. It is immediately on your left. The courtyard has nice vegetation. The place is dead quiet by 10pm. Yes there's a bar next door that plays nice Spanish music in the distance but by night is done. The street,50,692
" is by luck not a heavily driven one you'll see in evening is quiet. Your walking distance 1 block to a cheap breakfast I recommend called big Daddy's. Good American style and less than 100 pesos. Turn left out the door and your 1 block from all the major streets with shopping and restaurants. We highly recommend the Italian mama Rosa the mushroom risotto is sooooo good. Filling portions. Heavy. The joint has happy hour and amazing house wings. 2 blocks to Playa Norte the amazing beach. If you don't want to rough it in Sand Mayan beach club no fees for chairs if you buy drinks (minimum 300 pesos each which is nothing) or food. The rooms despite reviews are clean, the housekeeper's do amazing cleaning daily just turn your sign around and leave a buck or 2. The hot water (again despite reviews) is definitely not strong & takes a minute to get going but.... Drumroll... It is hot! Not one day in 7 did it not work well. Decent toiletries and 2 mini bottles of water a day. A bar fridge with freezer and Ice cube tray (no machine unfortunately). Convenience store next door 8 cans beer for 98 pesos about $5.75 American. You could taxi to Chedraui grocery if you need lots of stuff like a Walmart with grocery. But for chips, pop etc right next door. Amazing massage across the street in a Tiki hut above a bar Miramar looking on ocean see Mimi for $45 Us u get 100 minutes massage.  This is not fancy but it has great strong air conditioning, ceiling fan, nice courtyard, firm beds, hot water, good maid service, low price. It's all we could've expected and more for a reasonable price with no need to rent a golf cart it's all at your doorstep. We only rented 1 day to see the island. Hidden gem beach club Zama with amazing chairs, pools, views albeit a bit pricey food drinks but free chairs all day no minimum. I think of you go on expecting basic you'll be pleasantly surprised. Oh and comments they don't speak English in reviews? Every shift had someone who understood no problem.",10,692

"We were on our vacation and had just spent 14 days in Cancun and we're closing our vacation with 3 nights in Isla Mujeres.  I had gone online looked at the pics saw the overall star rating and choose to stay here.  When we finally arrived the girl at the desk did nit speak a word of English and that began our issues.  We were given the key to our room and we walked in and it smelt musty, the bathroom door would nit nit open to use the sink and what was suppose to be non smoking room reeked of smoke.  My hubby has an extreme allergy to smoke that's to some other issues and the smell gives him a migraine and eventually lead to incapacitation by being bed ridden for 2 days (no longer the perfect vacation).  We went to the front desk and because she did nit speak English in a high",40,692
" tourist area filled with English speaking tourist we had to use her keyboard and a translation software to have a conversation and asked for a different room, she said no non available.  I told her why we could nit stay there and asked for a refund so we could stay elsewhere as although their posting says non smoking rooms, there was a table directly out of our ""patio door"" that everyone smoked at and went direct through the badly sealed room door. The hotel is nit what it looks like in the pictures it is much older and a bit run down which is fine if u expect that and we would have stayed except for the health concerns and the inability to communicate with the front desk (she was nit friendly either).  Unfortunately I had to move us elsewhere and now apperently although they can rent this room out again, I'm nit entitled to any firm of refund which is not right and I am soooo disappointed.  I can therefore nit recommend this place for anyone to stay.  Please owners fix the issues, improved your customer service and attract the happy customers.",10,692

"Worst service in the world!  We arrived at the hotel room and saw that the water in Niagara was not going down the toilet.  We went to a receptionist. She brought the maintenance man and he tried to repair.  After two hours we tried to lower the water again but again no water and pumping in the toilet.  We asked to move to a room where the restrooms had been properly serviced and claimed that they had no available rooms.  After telling her we were paid and we couldn't be in a room without a toilet she offered another room that probably cost more, I went up with the maintenance person to check it too when he clicked the water down button in the bathroom all the sewage went up and he said it wasn't working either.  I went back to the receptionist to get another room but did not",40,692
"Staff here is wonderful and so helpful- they quickly booked us a snorkeling trip and assisted us with getting our covid tests before flying home. Hotel is quiet, peaceful, very clean, and the complimentary breakfast and coffee was so nice and light- fruit, toast, jam, and coffee. This is on the quieter, south side of the island. We will absolutely be returning here!",50,693
"Quiet little hotel on the south side of island. Perfect little place for a reasonable price. We got a whole week for an extremely low price. Plus, every morning George would make coffee and an entire plate of fruit for breakfast. Recommended",50,693
"My wife and I have visited Isla several times and this time we decide to stay on the ""less busy"" side of the island.  The hotel is very clean and organized, the rooms are large and there was plenty of hot water in the shower.  Each morning we were treated to a very nice breakfast of coffee, fresh fruit and toast.  There is ample room to park your golf cart.  The swimming pool was very clean and refreshing.  Note that finding the resort for the first time may be a bit of an issue since it's not on the main road.  I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a relaxing stay on Isla.",40,693
"We stayed here for two nights.  The rooms were comfortable and the location quiet on the south end.  Sergio, the inn keeper, was always ready to help us and very friendly.  Breakfast was toast, coffee and a nice fruit plate. Rates were reasonable.  Tip: access to the tub was treacherous.  Hang on to the grab bar to avoid slipping.",40,693
"My wife and I visit Isla Mujeres at least once per year.  We were married on the island and have come to view it as our ""home away from home"".  Over the years, we have stayed at many places on the island, but Villas Cocos is our favorite place to stay.  If you are visiting the island to get drunk and party hard every night, Villas Cocos is likely not your ideal place to stay.  My wife and I come to the island to relax, and in that regard Villas Cocos can't be beaten!  Located on the more secluded side of the island, Villas Cocos is the perfect place to stay if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Centro area of town.  It is quiet, tranquil, and the perfect place to relax with your spouse or partner.  Sergio and his team are amazing!  Each morning, Sergio",50,693
" personally handcuts an entire plate of fresh fruit for each guest for breakfast.  He also goes out of his way to make sure we have access to anything we need during our stays?  Need a golf cart?  Sergio can have one delivered to you directly to the hotel (and cheaper than the golf cart rental places charge in Centro). Need recommendations on what beaches to visit?  What restaurants to eat at?  What to do for fun?  Sergio's got you covered.  As for the hotel itself, it is fantastic!  They have their own private pool, amazing air conditioning, and consistent HOT water in the shower/whirlpool (which is noteworthy as most other hotels we have stayed at had poor water pressure and cold water).  The wi-fi at Villas Cocos is probably the strongest wi-fi we've encountered on the island.  And there are lots of fantastic restaurants nearby (easily accessible on foot or via golf cart) as well as fun activities.  Villas Cocos has been our go-to place to stay on the island for years, and it seems like each stay just gets better than the last. If you are visiting the island for a nice, romantic, relaxing time, Villas Cocos is a phenomenal place to stay.  We can't wait to return next year!  Thanks Sergio and staff for being so incredible.",50,693

"My boyfriend and me have spent Really good days in VILLAS COCO in Isla Mujeres. SERGIO has been the real RICHNESS of the hotel. He was so kind and helpful everyday and he let us feel like at home.  I loved his breakfast every morning. Attached my daily breakfast. The hotel is really nice and clean, the room are lovely and the hotel has a nice swimmingpool. The position is not in the downtown but you can arrive there in 5 minutes by scooter and you can also find nice beaches close to the VILLAS COCO. I suggest this lovely hotel and I suggest SERGIO. GUIA & SIMONE <3",40,693
Nice place fairly clean and the service was good in the afternoon. The morning guy was a little short but ok. If you are like my wife and I and just like to go to Isla and it doesn’t need to be fancy this is a good place.,40,693
We stayed here as a couple for 4 nights & 5 days and loved it. Very quiet and clean. Staff was nice and attentive. Very nice clean pool .There is a bar where u can order beer and drinks. Breakfast was good. Toast and fresh sweet fruit. Coffee was a bit strong and juice was delicious. Needed some eggs or meat and would have been perfect. We rented a golf cart for our entire stay there as u will need one to get around the island. I liked staying on this side of the island as the north end was busy crazy and full of noise and tourists. I have nothing bad to report about this hotel and would stay here again.,40,693
"A magical and homely place, right on the waterfront. Authentic and with personal service and a hug from the staff. Private beach. Stunning room. Everything is natural and special. A place that preserves the ecology and natural balance of the island.",50,694
"I stayed at Coco B for 2 weeks during a yoga teacher training and had the most amazing time. The place really is as beautiful as pictured. The place itself, the ‚private‘ beach, the staff, the food… loved everything and would definitely come back!",50,694
"I hosted a yoga retreat at Coco B in October and it was absolutely wonderful. Everything about the experience at Coco B exceeded our expectations. Lisa and her team were attentive, kind, and helpful. If you are looking to host a retreat here, you will not be disappointed-- they assisted me with everything from setting up the booking page, transportation, excursions, and everything! I will definitely be going back to host a retreat here again. Thank you to everyone at Coco B!",50,694
"This was my first time experiencing Islas Mujeres, and I'm so glad that part of my experience was staying at this beautiful place. As a guest there, you'll get gorgeous views, access to a private beach (pictured below) delicious fresh food -- prepared daily by the house chefs and kitchen staff--  well decorated/well kept rooms. The team at Casa Coco really makes you feel taken care of with their attention to detail, and commitment to ensuring you enjoy yourself. Especially Kevin, he went above and beyond, recommending hot local spots for dancing, killer tacos, and anything else you're looking for, he's your guy. By the end of my stay, I didn't want to go home; I was so in love with the island and the people who helped show me her magic!",50,694
"Beautiful setting, great ocean view room, fantastic and helpful staff. Went there for a yoga weekend and it was the perfect peaceful spot. Just wish there was a beach we could've used on this property.  There was a little strip of beach, but nothing we could lie on.",40,694
"The staff at Casa Coco are incredible and took amazing care of a group that I hosted there. Whatever we needed in terms of setting up excursions, navigating the island or getting around was taken care of swiftly. The space is open and inviting and my guests enjoyed lounging at the pool, swimming at the beach and gathering outside for long talks and after-dinner drinks. The food was wonderful and the chef did his best to accommodate the many diets and desires of our diverse group. I recommend this retreat center to anyone traveling with a big group and looking for a beautiful place to make your home base in Isla Mujeres.",50,694
"Having my 200hr yoga teacher training at Casa Coco made for the most perfect experience. We were all so well taken care of by all of the staff and it truly felt like a home away from home. The food was exceptional, the private beach was a dream and the overall ambiance was beautiful. I feel grateful to have been able to live on this wonderful property for 2 whole weeks and I will always remember how lovely my experience was! I hope to be back in the future. Thank you all so much!   Best, Emily",50,694
"I'd been working with the staff and property owner since early 2020 and had to wait till 2021 to come with my group of 24 women. Lisa was wonderful from start to finish and without her I'm not sure we would have had such a great stay. Thank you Lisa - this review is for you and because of you! Yes the onsite staff are lovely and as attentive as they could be. And the Chef made thoughtfully prepared meals to accommodate everyone's food issues. That was above and beyond! I wish the staffing had been more seamless and I wish the photos more closely resembled the property. The owner seems no longer interested after the booking is confirmed and money has been paid. He is lucky to rely on the staff.  But overall the yoga space is beautiful, food was perfect and everyone enjoyed",40,694

"Spent 4 nights at this small hotel.  I know we’re are still experiencing Covid, so my expectations are mindful of that.  First the good: - Staff friendly and accommodating - Location is great, close to beach and restaurants - Reasonable price - Good A/C  And the not so good: - No wifi in the rooms, despite listed on the booking sites - Mattress covered in plastic, not very comfortable  - Housekeeping lacking, no service first 2 days, shower door never cleaned  - One towel was ripped in the middle and stained   - Room constantly smelled of sewage, bought an air freshener",30,695
"Only a few minutes walk from North Beach and literally around the corner from Calle Hidalgo, this smaller hotel is perfect. Shops, restaurants, corner store, golf cart rentals all within a few feet.   Friendly and helpful staff, roomy rooms, good a/c and excellent shower pressure, bed was very comfy, refrigerator  - lots of pluses.   Coffee and cookies in the morning in the lobby and while wifi in the room we were in can be a hit or miss depending on where you are standing in the room, works perfect in the lobby.   They offer chairs and towels for the beach.   Only teeny little thing we wish we could have controlled was if you open your windows a little, the a/c automatically shuts off. ",50,695
"We we're looking got a nice center place to stay for 2 nights(2nd time in Isla) Great location, nice and helpful staff  clean rooms in a low price, they were also flexible with the checkout time with us.  Good value for the money. Kind regards, Shay",50,695
"For the price, this hotel has everything. They provide beach chairs and beach towels for no fee, are very helpful at the front desk, and are centrally located.  Room was clean, well kept, and plenty big.  I would definitely stay here again.",50,695
The hotel is very good. Rooms are very clean and comfortable.

"Hotel Isleno is a good value, comfortable option for any stay in Isla Mujeres. I had a couple of nights here at the end of my trip, having booked through Hotels.com. It is central, quiet and an easy walk to Playa del Note and the ferry. They kindly upgraded me for free to a room with a small balcony. 2 queen beds, decent sized bathroom, TV (although I never used it) in room fridge and safe, plus fan and air conditioning. My only concern was that after booking via one of the booking agencies, I always contact the hotel direct to reconfirm, especially if payment has not be taken up front. In this case I did not receive any response to all 3 of my emails (in Spanish and English) and in the end rang them, when they confirmed they had my booking.   I would definitely stay at Hotel",40,695

The rooms are clean, bright and better than you might expect at a budget-priced hotel.  This is a family-run operation and everyone was friendly and provided perfect advice on where to eat.  We loved living like a local!  The only drawback was stability of the Internet, but we got connected when needed (why work when you're on Isla?).",40,695

"After feeling ill a fee days, waking up with red eyes, drainage, itchy eyes, barely being able to brewthe out of my nose, I looked for the culprit… a ton of BLACK MOLD ON SHOWER CEILING! i complained to the receptionist…. they bleached the ceiling… …having bleached the shower, still doesnt remove the mold. It turns the mold white. Mold had deep roots and must have a fungicidal put on it to clean it for porous surfaces. The receptionist argued and had the maintenance man tell me bleach works and theyll paint over it to seal it. The receptionist asked why I didnt mention this earlier, well, because I didnt see it earlier. We only slept in the room and I kept waking up feeling awful. i had felt great when I first arrived to isla (covid negative times two). Thankfully we only had",10,696
" one night left as I asked for a refund but the receptionist argued with me about this process until we were back to our room at 2pm to grab our things to at least switch from the room with black mold on ceiling to hopefully another room and then he said he would refund us but at 2pm there was no point in trying to find another resort to reserve and check into. Had they approved the refund the night before we gladly would have left. They tried to cover the mold smell with a diffuser, two wall plug ins, a small dehumidifier that did not work, two damp rid containers that are supposed to absorb moisture and the disappointing part was our windows did not have screens and we already had some bugs in our room so it was impossible to get a good breezy air flow in our room to help get some fresh air. The second room also had mold that they bleached ofd shower ceiling as you could smell some bleach and see wet liquid marks on the ceiling. We also complained about the door entry locks as did the couple in the room next to us. we struggled to enter and exit the room which could be a hazard were there ever a fire there.  The breakfast at the mayan beach club was delicious and the staff was wonderful!",50,696

"The hotel itself was beautiful and very clean. Rooms are well-sized and finishes are great. Location is close to a lovely beach club (1 minute walk) and it is very easy to get around the island. Reception / concierge was very helpful with organizing taxis, questions about the island, and anything we needed relating to the hotel rooms. I visited with friends and they easily accommodated a large group.",50,696

The receptionists are very accommodating and any questions/requests are immediately resolved. I will continue to stay here every time I visit the island!",50,696
"If you are like us and like to explore and have space that feels like home - this hotel is for you. They were very nice & the hotel rooms are quite spacious. The amenities included are quite amazing for the price you pay - the access to free breakfast at 2 locations on each end of the island, and pool access at one and beach club access at another is great (just note for loungers at the beach club they require you to spend about 600 pesos on drinks/food). They had fresh filtered water waiting for us and pool towels, free parking for our golf cart, and they keep the exterior lights on till about 3am. We felt very safe and well taken care of. Highly recommend!",50,696
"The Room: We stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bath family suite for 4 nights and it was perfect in every way. Anytime we needed anything during our stay, we would simply walk around the corner since the main office is next door to the family suite and speak to Angel or Damian who were both very helpful. The hotel does provide pool towels which is fabulous, you just need to ask for them. The family suite was absolutely perfect for our family of 5 with our son sleeping on the pull out couch and our girls in the 2nd bedroom. Housekeeping made the couch bed down for him each night and cleaned our room daily.  The room, sheets, bedding, floors, etc. were all spotless (and I'm a clean freak that notices everything... so that says a lot)! The beds were comfortable. There is one King, a queen,",40,696
" and a sofa bed in the family suite. Also there are 2 safes in the family suite that were helpful to keep passports in while we were out and about.   Communication & Service: It was next level. Big shout out to Damian at the front desk who went above and beyond to help us secure a golf cart with 2 forward facing seats (which are harder to find)! He had it get delivered to the hotel, took our payment, and everything. He even communicated with me on Whats App to let me know it arrived!  You can park your golf cart right in front of the hotel. The street is a dead end, so there is not really any traffic.  If you stay here a golf cart is a must so you can go to North side for food and visit Mayan Beach Club for breakfast. Very quiet street. When we returned the cart, the owner of the company knew to expect us. I honestly felt like we had a personal concierge with how thoughtful he was!   FREE BREAKFAST & Access to Beach Clubs! Included in your stay is free breakfast at either Kin Ha or Mayan Beach club. So we drove to both and especially loved the breakfasts at Mayan Beach Club on North Side since there was more variety. You can pick anything off the menu and one juice. That alone was a $50 savings for our family each day and made this hotel worth it in every respect.  You can see the blue ocean from the upstairs level suites and even though it's just a peak of it, it's still incredibly beautiful. I didn't realize how close Kin Ha was...it's literally twenty steps from the hotel. We never felt like we needed to be beach front bc we were always at one of the beaches while we were there. Make sure to visit Garrafon De Castillo for fun snorkeling too. It's right down the road- very close.  Included in the price is also the ability to play at Kin Ha and we enjoyed snorkeling there one day. Definitely bring your own snorkels! Also the hotel provides purified water for every room so that was nice to refill our water bottles each day. There is a larger mini fridge in the family suite as well and a table if you want to eat any meals in the hotel. There are also some dishes and forks and spoons.   We would recommend this place- hands down- to anyone. We loved it and hope to return again!",50,696
We couldn’t have found anywhere more perfectly located ! Literally 5 minutes from a couple of beaches and also with all the bars and restaurants on our doorstep to wander around in the evenings soaking up the live music and amazing cocktails!  The hotel is tiny but the service is great  Clean towels everyday beach towels provided and the bed changed every other day ! Fresh coffee every morning and gorgeous cake ! The staff are so helpful !  Would have no hesitation in recommending,50,697

The rooms are clean, large and stocked with your toiletries.  My room, number 8 was perfect since it had a balcony facing the back.  Not much of a view, however it was located in the front of the building.  Our view was of the backyards to the locals.  They provide a continental breakfast which will include your coffee, tea, fruit which is usually an apple and at times a banana.    Some days we did get donuts or a cake which was pre sliced.  Sliced bread and a toaster with jams was always available.  Truthfully, if you are a light eater in the morning, this is sufficient since you are steps from a plethora of many local restaurants.

" You will need to request beach towels in advance since they are hard to come by especially if you drop it off after every trip to the beach.  The Wifi isn't so great unless you are in the lobby or 2nd floor area.  Despite this, you will receive a clean room, great hospitality and a place that will speak volumes in location!  Tell the gang the PA thres amigos say hello!  We made some grate friends on the island.  Oh, one last thing...get your fresh cut coconuts in front of Stingrays.

We ended up being on the 3rd floor that had a balcony overlooking Juarez.  The staff, especially Eduardo, is very nice and helpful.  We were provided beach towels as needed throughout our stay.  The room was large with ample space for storage.  There was a dresser, hangers, and other space for clothes.  There was a rain shower in the bathroom.  We did have a problem with the air conditioner one night, but it seemed to get fixed the next day.  I would have preferred an extra pillow, but this is me.  Noise was only an issue late New Year's Eve (or early New Year's Day).  The house next to the hotel had music",40,697

Pros:   - they had the only vacant room left in the city (that you could find on-line) during the Cumbre equinox festival at El Tajin;  - room was clean;  - removed from the crazy traffic in town, so quiet except for animal sounds; - the view from our wide window was wonderful: the hills, the blackbirds in the trees, the roosters and chickens below;  - window in bathroom; - bathroom and room were an OK size; - when we arrived at the wrong venue, a man who worked there immediately led us up to the correct hotel - free protected parking.    Cons:  - no elevator and our room was 3 floors up (no help provided);  - toilet seat very stained;  - broken window",20,698
" pane in bathroom;  - no breakfast provided; - a non-service attitude overall;  - no ability to take a credit card but required payment before arrival.    With a bit of money and a credit card terminal, this could be a good budget choice.  I would recommend it if they would care to fix up the small things.  I had wanted to stay at La Quinta de Los Leones but they were full.  I can't vouch for the rooms because they were occupied and could not be shown, but one of the workers there gave us a tour of what had originally been the home of Bishop Guizar, and our guide was very kind and welcoming.  Papantla is a madhouse of traffic on the steep narrow streets. Although it would have been nice to be able to walk into town, it was much better to be up on the hill. We left our car at the hotel and took a cab in and out of town (cost was about $2 and cab came right away to pick us up).   Papantla's zocalo is ringed with food vendors and souvenir (think vanilla) kiosks and there are two markets across the street, so it's an extremely lively place at night.",30,698
"Les photos ci-dessus datent certainement d'une période prospère de l'hôtel mais nous y sommes allés le 2 août 2016 et nous n'avons pas pu y dormir!! tout est désaffecté et horrible! mobilier abîmé cassé, les serviettes et draps pas propre et le personnel sentait très mauvais et nous n'étions pas en sécurité ! nous étions avec des amis qui avaient réservé mais nous avons décidé de partir trouvé un autre hôtel; le personnel ne nous a pas remboursé mais c'est scandaleux de trouver sur internet ce type d'établissement avec des photos mensongères! surtout ne pas y aller même si le tarif est attractif! ce batîment est digne d'être détruit!",10,699
"We stayed 4 nights here and would have stayed longer if our schedule permitted. The room and bed was comfortable. The room, hotel and outdoors areas are kept clean. The WiFi worked  well except for a technical fault which was beyond the control of the hotel and they got it fixed quickly. This is a basic hotel but it met all of our needs. We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor area listening to the birds. We were happy that we did not stay at a hotel in the town centre. Taxis only cost 20 pesos into town so we had the best of both worlds. Alicia and the other people at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. We would stay there again.",40,700
"Necesitaba un hotel para dormir y seguir el viaje a varias ciudades, en internet se veía no tan mal pero al llegar fue decepcionante, solía ser la casa de un obispo en algún tiempo está pegado a una iglesia, es lúgubre y antiguo, las recámaras nada cómodas y muy descuidadas, nos dio la impresión de ser inseguro aunque no tuvimos  contratiempos, fui con la familia, definitivamente no regresaría ",20,701
"Атмосфера романтичной запущенности и былого величия. Такое чувство, что они не доделали ремонт - нет ни одной вешалки в ванной (а были), но комнаты большие со шкафом, тумбочками и столиком с зеркалом. Старинная роскошная усадьба с выходом к неоготическому собору на холме, 3 этажа очень странным образом переходят друг в друга, в холлах рассыпающийся рояль, пыльный бильярдный стол, старинные предметы неизвестного назначения, резная массивная мебель. Тенистый сад с одной стороны, и выход на соборную площадь с другой. Однако, до центра придётся прогуляться минут 15, что для любопытного взгляда - одно удовольствие. И да, бара у них нет - только пиво. ",40,701
"El hotel es muy sencillo, pienso que el precio de $500 por noche es caro para lo que ofrecen, realmente no tienen ningún servicio adicional, las habitaciones no tienen aire acondicionado, sólo un ventilador, y la verdad es que hacía calor en abril. No está tan cercano al centro, talvez a unos 10 minutos en carro.",30,701
"Este hotel engaña con su publicidad, pues se presenta ubicado en la zona centro, pero está en una colina apartada a diez cuadras de la plaza principal; además, ofrecen lo que no tienen, como el estacionamiento que es en la calle, en un lote baldío cercano sin vigilancia. Igualmente la televisión en cuyos canales nada se puede ver ni oír por estar cargados de interferencia. Dicen tener bar y sólo es un refrigerador con cervezas y refrescos. En booking.com dicen que es nuevo, pero es un hotel viejo descarapelado de los muros que requiere con urgencia pintura. En el baño no había donde poner el papel sanitario que estaba en el lavabo. Las sábanas se encontraban manchadas de pintura, por lo que las tuvieron que cambiar. Lo único positivo que vale la pena destacar es lo amplio de la",20,701
"This place is expensive, dirty, old. And not pet friendly (in the description it stated pet friendly) So if you love yourself stay away.  Later dont come back and say it is not true. BTW this picture was taken in somewhere else, or was ages ago. Today the ""garden"" is full of junk and an unfinished building. Dont trust me? good luck!",10,702
"We stayed one night in the Hostal de Moncayo. It is a short (5 minute) walk from the zócalo and thus close to everything you need, but quiet at night. Rooms have a nice view out over the town and are clean and comfortable: while a bit basic they have everything you need. What really impressed me was the attitude of the owner, Gustavo, who was helpful and went out of his way to assist us when we left behind some papers in our room, ensuring that we got them back safe and sound. If there is nobody about when you arrive, try next door to the right. There is parking on site.",40,702
"I stayed 2 nights in order to visit Papantla and go to El Tajin, the place is simple, the owner is friendly and interesting to talk with. It is located 10 minutes walk from the bus depot which is a big plus, also only about 10 minutes to the main square",40,703
"Love, love this hotel! We have stayed here on 4 different trips and will stay here next time as well. The staff is so wonderful and welcoming. Gabriel is a gem. I had several questions and changes in the months leading up to our trip and every time I sent an email he was so helpful and quick to reply. The location of the hotel is great. Very close to the supermarket, restaurants and beach. Beach chairs are provided, which we love! The cleaning staff does a great job on keeping everything clean and sand free! We can’t wait to return!",50,704
"What a wonderful oasis.  We recently spent two very enjoyable weeks at XBulu-Ha.  Our suite was well-appointed, comfortable, and spotlessly clean.  The hotel offers a quiet respite close to the vibrant centre of Isla’s main village.  It is also just a short walk to the beautiful North Beach.  Gabriel and his staff are friendly, welcoming, and accommodating.  It is a happy place and we look forward to returning.",50,704
Do Not listen to the guy who is saying bad comments about this Hotel. I have stayed in many Hotels on Isla Mujures over 35 years. This is a Very Good Hotel. Honestly! The rooms are very clean. Great staff. Quiet and one of the Best Boutique Hotels on the Island. Rourke Howard,50,704
The worst experience ever they had roaches no water and worst customer service ever very rude in the front desk. I tried to get the managers name and they said they didn’t need to give me that information and find out myself. It looks like the room was not cleaned properly the bed looked like the sheets we’re not changed and they couldn’t even put new shampoos or soap in our bathroom when requested then they said they would  send them and never got them.,10,704
"Quaint little no frills hotel. Clean! Cold AC, hot water. Friendly, accommodating staff. Close to the beach and Hidalgo. Beach towels provided and beach chairs are available first come first serve. This hotel cannot be beat for the price.",50,704
"We stay for two weeks in this Hotel which is very close to North Beach. Excellent staff! Super clean! Anel was super helpful, she gave us tips to venture around the island and recommend local Restaurants. Also, the owner Gabriel was at all times checking on us, making sure we were satisfied with our stay. Housekeeping did a great job, our room was spotless everyday! The location is just at the right spot, you have all amenities near by without the noise of being around the bar areas. Just a block from the malecón , a block from the a market, 2 blocks from the grocery store, 6 min walk from Playa Norte, which Is the best beach in all Quintana Roo. Bars and restaurants one block away and 7 min walk from the Port. I was with my Husband and my 3 children ( 14,9 and 8 ). I totally",50,704
 recommend this Hotel!  Karla Mercado,10,704

If I could leave zero stars I would. 100% the worst customer service I’ve ever entailed in my whole life.  Stayed for 2 nights and they tried to charge us for 3. Miscommunication due to language barrier on both parties- the receptionist started shouting at me during our conversation about checking out and laughed at us in our faces on the phone to the hotel owner. I’m so disgusted.  On top of that- we had no water in our shower the first night and no water to flush the toilet the second. No WiFi in our rooms as promised and a cockroach during our first night stay.   I do not recommend this place at all. I found it through recommendation on google reviews but wish I hadn’t. I even apologised for the inconvenience but she refused An apology back and laughed at mine. They wrongly,50,704
 kept our deposit when we didn’t use their room. Extremely money grabbing. We aren’t made of money and they acted disgustingly.,50,704
"Las cabañas son amplias, pero llega muy poca agua caliente a la regadera, los Desayunos los preparan  a partir de las 9am.  La piscina no tiene buen mantenimiento. La atención de recepción es muy mala, tardaron mucho en confirmar la disponibilidad de las cabañas que reserve.  El último día y aún cuando todavía no desocupábamos, enviaron al servicio de limpieza indicando que la habitación ya tenía que limpiarse.  No, no recomiendo este alojamiento. ",10,705
"leí sobre este hotel en la revista de México desconocido, decidimos reservar el hotel y al llegar nos dijeron que estacionáramos afuera, enfrente de la puerta... a las 9 de la noche empezó a llover y se desbordo el río sobre la calle.. la corriente se llevo los carros de toda la cuadra, incluyendo el nuestro... al día siguiente nos dijeron que siempre se inunda esa calle, que nos debieron avisar por parte del hotel. Terrible experiencia, no se hospeden aquí!!!",10,706
"Es un hotel antiguo. Los pasillos son muy calientes. El primer día estuvimos en la habitación del segundo piso y fue muy ruidosa. Después nos pasaron al cuarto piso y la situación mejoro un poco. En la primera habitación el aire acondicionado era muy ruidoso y las toallas estaban sucias, pero en el piso 4 todo mejoró. Esta a una cuadra de la plaza principal, pero es de subida y es agotador. Considero que es caro para lo que ofrece.",30,706
"I stayed here for 4 nights as Hotel Tajin was fully booked.  Room price was not too bad M$350 and the sheets were clean and beds were comfortable.  The hotel and rooms are rough round the edges and dated and the walls are dirty.  There are some weird smells in the rooms and the landings.  I stayed in room 110 first night and halfway though the night was woken up by the smell coming through the window from outside, methane/petrol.  Pretty nasty.  Moved to 203 which was better but still had its own odour.  Staff were friendly.  Short walk to plaza.  Wifi in communal areas only.  If you're looking for a basic place to stay for a couple of nights its OK but not if its your main holiday destination.  Rooms facing the street get noisy from about 6.30am.",20,706
"Hotel simple et basique de prix économique, les chambres sont spacieuses et propres. Contient salle de bain et WC privatif. Le personnel est accueillant et sympathique. Etablissement suffisant pour passer une nuit. Bien situé près du Zocalo.",30,707
"Ubicado en el corazón de la ruta del Café y la Vainilla, los Cantaron del Sol es un Centro Ecoturístico para quienes buscamos desconectarnos del mundo exterior y adentrarnos en la esencia de nuestro planeta.  En un entorno en el que las aves entonan sus adorables cantos, entre árboles tupidos de naranjas jugosas y dulces que, si lo deseas, puedes tomar del árbol y comerlas; rodeado de plantíos de vainilla, café, canela, cascadas, pozas, ríos y paisajes que a veces creemos que ya no existen a nuestro alrededor, Zozocolco es un sitio que te hace volver a tener esperanzas de que este planeta aún puede sobrevivir a los estragos que le hemos provocado los humanos.  Pero ¡Cuidado! si eres esclavo de la TV y el WiFi, este Centro Ecoturístico en Zozocolco, simplemente No es para ti:",50,708
"Great location, right dead center in downtown Papantla. Only a few minutes ride in a cab to El Tajin. Cold AC and hot water. I gave 4 stars because the view we got was of the hallway and the you need to turn the water on about 25 minutes before you want to shower to let it get hot. Takes forever. There are a few rooms (1-5) that have nice balconies overlooking downtown. Pretty view. Otherwise you will get an interior room with your window looking into the hallway. The staff was friendly. Helped us when we needed more towels. Don't speak English but my husband speaks Spanish so not a problem for me. If I come back to this area I would stay here again. ",40,709
"I stayed here only one night, arriving late (1am) and leaving early to visit El Tajin (taxi from Zocalo MXN70, taxi colectivo back for MXN15 per person). Check-in was quick and confusion over the room I was assigned (which had not been cleaned and prepared) was quickly resolved. The room's air-conditioning was effective and had a wall-mounted Tv which I did not use. The room itself was very basic (cost approx MXN550) and the Internet worked ok but not great and with limited range. It's location could not be better, in the main square among shops and restaurants and with some rooms, presumably, facing the church across the Zocalo. Staff were all very friendly, and happy to look after bags after our check-out.",30,709
"papantla is a  nice town that we enjoyed visiting. The Provincia Express is clean but basic, no restaurant for food and the window of our room could not be opened to ventilate. We ate at the nearby Plaza Pardo which was good and it has a lovely view of the parque/ zocalo ",30,709
"This hotel is perfectly placed overlooking the very active main plaza where the voladores can be viewed from a front balcony room. Very clean, staff is very helpful, the a/c works, all king beds in the front rooms. The hotel referred a local Totonac guide for a vanilla plantation/horticulture experiment green house for a 2 hour tour. The guide is also available for touring many local attractions at a very reasonable price. Restaurants and vanilla retailers next to the hotel, El Tajin is a 15 min taxi ride and the room a/c was a welcomed relief after visiting the pyramid for 4 hours.",50,709
"This hotel is probably the best in town, with the best view if you get a plaza facing room. There is no hotel parking but if you are patient enough you can find free all day all night parking right next to the hotel. Very conveniently located near everything, shopping, restaurants, etc. Check supplies when you get your room, just in case!  About $700 Mexican pesos per dat for the best room.",40,709
"We spent one night here before visiting El Tajin archeological site. The hotel was clean, right on the plaza and comfortable. My one word of caution is to request a room away from the lobby. It was very very noisy at night. From our bed, we could hear the front desk phone ringing and hear people talking. Other than that, it was a great place to stay.",40,709
"Reading the reviews, I decided to stay there. Here's what I didn't like: Hard to find, no signs outside... it's on the first floor, no elevator and no one to help with the luggage No hotel parking or special rate, extra cost of over 200 Pesos nearby (100 pesos 9PM-9AM +15 pesos/hour before or after) Included breakfast was still not ready by 10 AM... another 170 Pesos expense at the restaurant next door. Safety risk: the railing keeping you from falling down a staircase on the way to the room has no grid whatsoever... traveling with an infant, that was an additional worry...  The rooms are ok, so if you don't mind all of the above,...",20,709
"I moved to this hotel after the disappointment of El Tajin. At the same price, there is no comparison in quality. Provincia Express is much newer, nicer, more comfortable. ",50,709
"I would go back to the Hotel Provincia Express in Papantla in a heartbeat. It was about $50 USD / night, and had a prime location right on the zocalo. If you get a room facing the zocalo you'll be able to see the voladores fly out your window, which is a truly remarkable experience. The staff was super friendly and the wifi and AC were very reliable. Room and bathroom very clean. I highly recommend this hotel.",50,709
"Stayed there last December for 1 night while visiting El Tajín. Clean room and batthroom, Wifi included, and friendly staff. Probably the best bang for the buck in Papantla.",40,709
Gustavo was awesome.  He went above and beyond to help us with renting our cart and answering all of our questions.  Check this place out if you want to be treated like you matter to him and his business.,50,711
"if you are looking for Party and Music this is not the place to stay, this is a Beautiful and Relaxing Place, for people that wants to be quiet and enjoy stunning views of the Ocean and Mountains,  The Villas are Beautiful and their pools are just wonderful. the beach is not good for swimming and need to be careful with the rays.

"Bahia Villas is located about 10 miles south of Loreto itself in a delightful community, Loreto Bay.  We stayed in a two bedroom condo which was immaculately clean and had a full kitchen and several outdoor spaces for lounging.  Beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked, allowing us to prepare our own meals.  The resort is right on the beautiful bay, making it easy for walks on the beach, fishing from shore, snorkelling, and kayaking.  The village of Loreto Bay had a bakery/coffee shop with tasty cinnamon buns and a wine bar with the best margaritas!  I highly recommend this wonderful resort!",50,712
"This is in a great location, literally just down the street from the square, restaurants and Alamo rental car. The lodgings were immaculately clean and well equipped and had an ""observation deck"" with great views of the mountains. Parking is in their courtyard and the rooms came with coffee, creamer, breakfast muffins, fridge, stove, free internet.",50,713
"I just spent a week at Bugambilias and was very pleasantly surprised. The rooms are spacious, and fitted with high quality furnishings. Everything you would expect from a high end hotel right here in downtown Loreto.  he real benefit is the full service kitchen complete with everything you could possibly need. The hotel is located just off the main boulevard, and convenient to grocery stores. A short walk to the downtown square, and rooms have bicycles for those wishing to explore further. Overall, a great experience and I would highly recommend this hotel over some of the more expensive ones in the area. Thank you Bugambilias.",50,713
"Great price,super clean, excellent staff, easy walking distance to most shops and restaurants.  Off street parking with locked gate evenings.  We couldn’t be happier with our stay.  Coffee service  in room and fantastic air conditioner.  ",50,713
"Clean, functional and perfectly placed, what sets the Bugambilias Suites Hotel apart is the lovely people that run it. They could not have been more helpful and friendly. I would definitely return when I return to Loreto.",50,713
"We loved our stay at this hotel.  Very clean and well maintained hotel with great customer service.  Beautiful sunset views from the rooftop.  Although it's not on the beach or around the town square, it's easy walking distance to those places and the price was very reasonable. The only problem we had was the battery was dead in the in room safe.  But when I reported it, they had it fixed within a couple hours while we were out. Will definitely stay there again.",50,713
Stayed here for a couple of nights on a driving trip through the Baja. This hotel is just perfect for travelers. Secure gated parking in the courtyard. The hotel is only 3 years old so the rooms are like new and immaculate and have everything you need. Very well laid out and super comfortable. Hotel is a short walk into town and very quiet at night. Staff are super nice here with a warm welcome from everyone. We loved it here.  Highly recommended by Oldbackpack.,50,713

"Very well kept, clean property with attention to detail.  Our room was equipped with kitchenette, microwave, good size fridg, a/c & ceiling fan with lights.  Beautiful built-in closets; nice bed.  Lovely potted and vining plants enhance the area.  Roof top sitting area with city views. Walking distance to restaurants and the Malecon.  Wonderful proprietor--sunny disposition and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again.",50,713
"This is comfortable, clean, safe, and welcoming.  What else can you ask for?  Kitchenettes that are well stocked, free parking, and free use of bicycles. (not sure if all rooms have kitchenettes-check on this when you make your reservation)  Also the staff and owners are beyond wonderful.",50,713
We found this to be a very pleasant and convenient hotel. We were concerned it was not by the beach or looking too cute but it turned out to be just right for us. Very Comfy bed Clean bathroom with hot water and great pressure. Best thing: body lotion for sunburnt skin (ours got confiscated at the airport but there are plenty of pharmacies in town)  Fully equipped kitchen though we didn’t use it as there were plenty of nice restaurants in town. However if you are planning a longer stay of fancy cooking breakfast this is handy. There is a supermarket only a couple of blocks away.  Secure parking. Good location - the town is vey small and the hotel is only a few blocks away from the restaurants and the sea front. It is quiet but close to everything.  The hotel offers free bikes. ,50,713
"Perfect spot in Loreto —- in town near restaurants, coffee, music and shops. Oralia is so kind and helpful, assisted with kayak and SUP to the beach. Highly recommend. Super clean, and the WiFi is very good. Already booked a week for the holidays, excited to return to Loreto",50,714
"Villas del Santo Nino I want to take a minute to give praise to Villas del Santo Nino in Loreto.   We have stayed here a couple of times and enjoy it even more each time.  This time we spent almost a month with our kids (6mo and 2.5yo).  The Datil I was just perfect for us, it has 2 rooms and everything for us to live there and also feel like we are on vacation!   The hosts Oralia & Francisco couldn't be better.  They acknowledged every concern we had (which weren't many) and met every expectation we had while in Loreto.  The location is perfect, about a block from the Malecon (boardwalk) and only steps from many restaurants and the town center.  They have a few common areas including a BBQ and outdoor eating area, a beautiful sitting area with small library & a hammock garden. ",50,714
" The property is kept clean and tidy at all times, the beautiful flowers and plants look great and add to the beauty of Villas del Santo Nino.  They have a fleet of bikes for your use! They organized a dinner to be cooked in their garden that far exceeded our expectations.  We asked if we could have dinner cooked for us one night and the result was a gorgeous feast for almost 20 people for a very reasonable price.  The chef and assistants came with a BBQ, chairs, tables, and a couple people helping.  The food was incredible and there was plenty of it!  We'll definitely do this next time we are in Loreto. They have a few helpers that take care of the property, Jessy is the most awesome person we could imagine.  She is very busy keeping the grounds clean and tidy.  She helped us with our kids and we can't say enough good about her!   The hosts are very classy people and allow you to enjoy your vacation, they are also available for anything from requests to advice for what restaurant to eat at!  They truly are the best hosts we have stayed with.  Their house is removed enough that we would go days without seeing them.   We can't say enough about Santo Nino, we hope to get back to Loreto and stay here.",50,714

"The location is excellent, near the sea and the Mission.  The hosts are very friendly and seek to make the stay as pleasant as possible. Close to good restaurants, it is an ideal place to be in Loreto. I understand that you can stay for a weekend or for a few months",50,714
"My husband and I travelled around Baja for 5 weeks last January.  We both fell in love with Loreto but particularly Villa Santo Niño.  Our hosts, Francisco and Oralia were the perfect hosts, paying close attention to details and making sure we had everything we needed.  The studio and the grounds were spotless and the kitchen was equipped with everything you could think of. The studio was located just a few minutes walk to the central plaza and to the beach on the Sea of Cortes.  We had access to bikes, kayaks, and we could enjoy our morning coffee in the beautiful surrounding gardens. We are already planning to return next year:)",50,714
"Sto Nino has a special place in my heart. The warmth of the owners, the charm of the rental units, the fabulous central location, between the central plaza and the Sea of Cortez, all come together to make for the perfect vacation rental. Chato and Oralia are perfect hosts who greet each day with a smile, help you with your plans and are enthusiastic to hear about your adventures! They have become my family in Loreto.",50,714
We love coming to Loreto and staying with Oralia and Chato. We wanted 6 months but my wife passed away. Her 3minths here last year were some of her happiest. I returned this year at her request with gifts. ,50,714
"Villas Santo Nino are a true home from home. The owners / managers are called Oralia and Chatto and they both go out of their way to make your stay with them as comfortable as can be. All  the accommodations are very well equipped plus good Internet and  TV. They also have a collection of coolboxes, collapsible chairs plus snorkelling gear for the use of guests, plus bicycles and kayaks again for the use of guests.",50,714
"An appreciation of the Villa Santo Nino  begins with the location.  Less than a block from the town square in Loreto and a short distance from the Sea of Cortez the Villa's are in walking distance from great restaurants in Loreto including those with views of the Ocean. The grounds of the Villa's are a beautiful desert garden, when you leave your Villa your are surrounded by beauty.  We have been in two apartments and both were furnished and decorated as if they were some ones home rather than a rental Apartment.  The kitchen is furnished with every thing one could possibly need.  Equally as important is the genuine care and friendliness of the owners who are always willing to assist their guests.  ",50,714
"My partner and I have stayed at Casa Mangos twice.  It's a beautiful small hotel, in a great central location.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Liz is an amazing host and helped us in so many ways.  She is fluent in Spanish and just an all round wonderful person. The breakfast is an added bonus!  Yum!  As well as the bikes available to get around town.  It's our go to place when we come to Loreto.  Highly recommend!",50,715
"Casa Mangoes is a great little hotel. Only 5 (I think) rooms, very clean and comfortable. The owner, Liz, is very friendly and accommodating. It’s a great location, close to the malecón, the plaza, and lots of restaurants. Would definitely stay here again.",50,715
"We had a quick weekend getaway in Loreto and stayed at the beautiful and relaxing Casa Mangos! Liz and her assistant Vicky were incredibly welcoming and helpful, and the property was immaculate and very well appointed. Only a couple blocks from either the beach or the plaza, everything you might want to see in town is within easy walking distance, and if you are more adventurous they have nice bikes you can use as well.  Breakfast is included at Orlando's down the  street, and they have great food and friendly staff. A bit further is the plaza, with many nice restaurants, gift shops, and bars.  Loreto is a beautiful and clean city, and you can tell that the people love it here and are very proud of it. It is very safe, and everyone is super welcoming and friendly. It is not the",50,715
" crazy nightlife kind of place that Cabo is, but it is more zen and traditional. Very, very nice.  The Casa Mangos is a fantastic hotel and run even better! I strongly recommend that you  consider Casa Mangos for your next Loreto vacation!",50,715
…,50,715
"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our 5-day paddle trip around the islands (see Sea Trek Baja).  It was perfect for us: having our own little studio apartment just a couple blocks from the plaza, with easy access to everything but removed from some of the downtown music at night.  We especially liked morning and evening walks along the sea, breakfast down the block at friendly Orlando's, the tasty ice cream and frozen juice-pops next door, and a variety of fun restaurants aimed at either visitors (e.g. Mezzaluna) or folks from Loreto (e.g. Super Burro).   One of the nicest things about staying here is getting to know Liz, who treats you as a friend and genuinely wants you to enjoy and love Loreto as much as she does.",50,715
"We had a lovely 3-night stay at Casa Mangos. Immaculate condition. Loreto was easily accessible from our unit, the ""Manila"" room. The courtyard is relaxing and provides a break from the sun on warm afternoons. We rode bikes (provided) around town - perfect for easy exploring. Breakfast provided a short walk away at Orlando's Restaurant - also a treat. Liz, the owner, and Viky, her assistant, are accommodating and knowledgeable. Good parking out front for a full-size van. Loved this place.",50,715
"My long weekend at Casa Mangos was fantastic! I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of the town so close to the comfort and quiet of my studio in a charming setting. Accommodation was very clean, filtered drinking water was provided as well as bikes for exploring the town. Host Liz provided great contacts for sea and land activities. Breakfast at Orlando’s was a bonus. A definite YES for another vacation!",50,715
"Stayed several night in  the Casa and would certainly do it again.  Location: close to the central plaza and malecon of Loreto with lots of restaurants and several travel agencies.  Room: Generous, clean and nice design.  Bed is big and comfortable. Quiet during the night.  Infrastructure: there's a hamock as well as well as several seating options if you want to relax. Water for free.  Breakfast: delicious. You can get it at Orlando's, just a few steps from the hotel.  Host: Liz was very sweet and did everything to make me feel comfortable. Especially thankfull for her help my with my trip to San Ignacio.",50,715
"My stay at Casa Mangos did not  disappoint! It is such a lovely small, well-maintained facility and the owner and her staff are happy to help you navigate the town, find the best places to eat and explore, as well as hooking you up with boat rides for pleasure or fishing with the best in their business.  Breakfast is included six days a week at Orlando’s restaurant just one block away – – an extra that is much appreciated but not obligatory.  The hotel is centrally-located near the plaza and walking distance to just about anywhere in town. Bicycles are available at no charge and provide a fun way to explore the entire town.  Whether you’re in Loreto for just a few days or an extended stay, I highly recommend you choose Casa Mangos as your home base",50,715
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jeff and Linda's. They, along with Cyndi, were amazing hosts and helpful in every way from suggesting wonderful restaurants to helping us book fishing and touring activities. Our room was perfect and we enjoyed using the bikes to get around town. The location was great for walking to town. We even used the shared outdoor kitchen to grill the fish we had caught earlier in the day. We highly recommend and will absolutely stay there on future trips to Loreto",50,716
"Love this place!  Spending a month this time, and enjoying every day.   All the wonderful amenities mentioned above, plus the luxury of on-site massages by excellent masseuse Heidi.  Jeff, Linda, and Cindy ensure a great time is had by all guests.   They are also very Covid-19 safe with masks, extra cleaning, and all other precautions one would hope for.",50,716
"Large property with only 4 rooms The furniture was nice Rooms are large and the location is far enough away from the town the it is quiet. Having  access the bikes was great. The beach is less than 2 blocks away, I was able to run on the beach every morning. We were the only ones on the property. It is safe and secure. Cyndi checked in on us from a distance to make sure were had everything. The AC hot water and fridge all worked well. There is a fully equipped kitchen available for longer stays . The best feature for us was the large pool on site.",50,716
"Wonderful small hotel near the beach with everything you could wish for.  Owners Jeff and Linda have thought of every detail, including lovely grounds, excellent pool, well-furnished large rooms, great showers, and super-comfortable beds.  Resident Cindy is very helpful with explanations and local suggestions.  We will return for sure!",50,716
"My husband and I couldn’t have asked for more during our recent week long stay in Loreto.  This location is quiet yet within minutes of the malecon and the central part of town.  As of October 2019 a taxi from the airport is a standard $21.00. We lucked out in that a gentleman asked if we’d like to share.  The property is gated and Cindy who is the resident manager greeted us and showed us to our room (Pacifica) on the first level at poolside and explained all the amenities.  We had a king size bed and kitchenette which included a full size refrigerator with purified water which was full and easily replenished  The space was immaculate and the layout is well thought out with plenty of storage, seating, tables, overhead fans, as well as a brand new quiet AC. There was flat screen",50,716
" Direct TV and DVD player, as well as reliable wifi.  In addition to the cooking space in our room, we had full access to the open air main kitchen which was part of the original private home. The pool area was attractive and very well maintained with padded lounge chairs for all and thick pool towels.  There was also snorkeling gear to borrow and towels for the beach.  If we chose we could have borrowed a paddle board. We were steadily reminded and encouraged to ask if there was anything we needed.  In fact, my husband likes a light by the bedside to read at night, so he asked Cindy.  And she along with Linda who is one of the owners came through immediately. Cindy is a wealth of information and essentially offers “concierge” type service. She knew we wanted to take a boat ride tour out to the island of Coronado to snorkel. So she advised us to take advantage of the weather on a particular day and we did. She knows her stuff and we lucked out because the conditions were perfect unlike other days that were extremely windy  On our last day we took her up on calling “her guy” for our return taxi to the airport.  On the day before we left Cindy accommodated our wish to see other units for future reference.  And if you don’t mind stairs the upper level rooms have private balcony space and views.  Really you could be happy in any of the units.   One thing to note is Loreto Playa is geared toward adults who desire a quieter atmosphere.  The only noise we “endured” was the roosters in the morning. And we actually loved the wake up call.  We took full advantage of the bicycles that were offered going back and forth from town. If you choose not to pedal, the town is still within walking distance. A few days into the trip we opted to rent a car for two days to be able to get to a couple of remote sites, specifically  Mission San Francisco Javier and Mulege and the Bahia de Conception.  At the end we expressed our gratitude to Cindy and our desire to return.  Once again she offered us good advice in terms of knowing that you do need to plan well in advance. Loreto Playa is generally filled with repeat guests who come for extended stays.",50,716

"I almost don't want to write this review because I'd like to keep this place my little secret! Absolutely loved this gem of an inn. Run by Linda and her husband, retirees from Alaska, this place made us feel at home. We were the only guests at the time so had the place to ourselves. There's a big community kitchen well stocked with dishes and common cooking needs (oil, salt, etc) and a fancy coffee machine that makes a really tasty cuppa. The pool offered refreshing respite from the heat of the day. The beach is about 2 blocks away. The inn has paddle boards and bikes you can use to explore the area. Our room was spacious and clean, with peek-a- boo view of the sea. This will be where I stay on my next visit to Loreto, which hopefully will be soon!",50,716
"This place is wonderful.  Linda and Jeff, owners and Cindy, manager are fabulous.  They bend over backwards to do what they can to make your stay pleasant.  The once private family home has been turned into a 5 room boutique hotel.   Our room was large, with a kitchenette, huge walk in closet,  large tile shower and king bed. The rooms are quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  The pool was just outside our door and the spacious outdoor kitchen was just across the way.  They have bikes and kayaks for guests to use and the melacon is just a few blocks away as is the ocean.  I would highly recommend this hotel.  ",50,716
"Wow!  I'll start with the good.  The views & seclusion of this place were amazing. The waves heard from from our door step...  The high speed internet that we had wouldn't send an email (SERIOUSLY).  This is after calling before hand to make sure Villa Linda Mar had stream-able internet.  We are travel nomads.  Listed on their website is a heated pool.  Not only is this pool not heated, it's absolutely gross.  It's like stagnant water.  You can't even see through it.  It just hasn't been maintained at all.    The kitchen area that was suppose to be something we could all use was horrible.  It looked like an outdoor garage with a burn pit (pizza oven).  It was non-useable.  The grounds are covered in garbage & the greenery isn't kept up as the pictures show.  They say they have",10,717
" kayaks - they do.  We found out later that we were unable to go in the garage to get them because it was too dangerous.  This meant the kayaks were unusable to us.  When we nicely sent an email to Linda asking for a refund on the remaining days of our stay.  She not only denied, she didn't even respond to us.    The internet was so bad that we had to move & take matters into our own hands.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't book this reservation.  You will not be pleased & at this rate -- you'll be able to find an actually nice place in Loreto.  Please don't book with Villa Linda Mar.  The views are great but you can find them elsewhere with great amenities.  Terry Jay Gremaux  ",50,717

Después de unos maravillosos dias con ustedes. Quiero agradecerle a cada uno de los empleados que nos atendieron y en especial a Antonio parte de los Bell boys team. Todos fueron muy amables. Muchas gracias por todo. Claro que volveremos en la primera oportunidad.,50,720
"THE HOTEL OF NO RETURN! We went out to see the place with our friends who were checking it out for their wedding. We had to do a ridiculous timeshare presentation that my wife and I ended up bailing on because our “rep” was simply just bad at his job. The grounds were nice, but the employees literally clueless on multiple levels. First, they only care if you buy one of their intentionally convoluted timeshare plans only purchased through “points.” Second, you can’t depart when you want to leave! They all said our cab was “10 minutes.” We asked everyone how to get TF out of here and they all just asked about our presentation! F me! They would just let us leave. Don’t go here. Don’t fall for it. Like Don Henley said “you can go, but you can’t ever leave.”",10,720

"Manny is the best elite pool waiter to have at Danzante Bay Villa Palmar resort. System allows for wireless calling of wait staff for ordering and paying so you are not on “Mexican time” ( which is good for you, too!).",50,720
"I love this place. The setting is beautiful, and Mariana (the owner) and friends have done so much to create a hospitable, lovely, safe campground for bike tourists, backpackers, and ""overlanders"" in vans and other very SMALL solarized recreational vehicles.   There's a cute open-air wooden cooking trailer, clean restrooms with lovely tilework and hot water (you must light the hot water heater 5 minutes before a shower--not a big deal), and a few communal plugs for charging phones/laptops. There are also a couple of modest rooms to rent. all this amidst lovely gardens and beneath towering, shady palms.   Often there are young artists from Mexico staying and working on art installations, and Mariana also provides space for volunteers to prepare for community events (like the",40,721
" annual Whale Festival in March). The only amenity lacking for low-footprint campers is a laundry facility, but there are several big sinks and a clothes line for travelers to handwash and line-dry clothing items.   Note: There are no hook-ups, but your boondocking experience/solar camping experience is enhanced by flush toilets and showers, chairs and tables, bbqs, kitchen area with shared fridge, and well-lit common areas.",50,721

The bathrooms were stocked with everything that we could need, and the water pressure was great. The kitchen had everything necessary for an extended stay, and even had board games in one drawer!  The unit itself was very quiet and it felt like we had a great deal of privacy. We barbecued on the 2nd floor patio a couple of times, and often enjoyed morning coffee on the 3rd story balcony. Two bicycles came with the unit, and they were fun to ride around the neighborhood. The washer and dryer in the unit came in handy.  It was a short drive in to town for shopping and restaurants, so it was conveniently located. Maggie and Ernesto were there to help with anything that we",50,722

This kitchen has a full-sized fridge, a four-burner range, nice night lighting, and cabinets stocked with essential cooking and serving items (nothing fancy, so I suggest bringing your own chef's knife like I do when I travel). There was fresh ground coffee, milk, cooking oil, salt, sugar, and pepper. There was a clothesline for drying our towels and suits, and they even let us use their washer even though there was a small laundry service just down the street.  Some other highlights: fast and stable wifi, heated pool, central location with an easy walk to beaches and central plaza, and good parking. It is really clean with a nice pillow-top queen bed, and bedside reading lights, Also, two sweet cats. One of them is named Goliath because he came to them off the street as a kitten close to death from starvation, but he fought hard to survive.

After a successful day fishing, Bruce connected us with a restaurant that was willing to cook our fish for us.

We found our way there and were welcomed into a roomy, clean and quiet place at a price much more in keeping with our budget.  We stayed for only 3 nights in Loreto but could have settled right in at Bruce's.  He provides a fridge and barbecue on the patio and we had our own coffee maker in the room.  He directed us to a laundrymat, grocery store and restaurants.  We enjoyed his relaxed manner and our discussion of world events.  Thanks Bruce.",40,724

It is a half a block from the marina and beach.  It is also in close proximity to the shopping area & restaurants.  Our favorite restaurant, recommended to us by Bruce, was the Giggling Dolphin.

We were just passing through to our final destination and found this place by chance.  Having RV in the title is a little deceiving.  They do have RV spots with full hook ups but it is a little community of housing and just an open parking space for the RV’s and Campers (which worked well for us for the night).  They have full hook ups which can be hard to find on the Baja.  Access to the swimming pool and a small private beach area for the residences.  The shower and bathrooms were clean and in good repair. There was a super friendly gentlemen that is a full time camper that was very helpful.,30,725
"Super tight spaces and much maneuvering to wiggle in because long term people park their cars and toys all over the place. The pool was closed and it was too far from town to walk, and we paid a whopping 525Pesos per nite. That worked out to $35 Canadian!  Dogs outside the park howled, and fought all night - needed ear plugs. On the plus side, people were friendly.",20,725

"Pro:  clean, hot showers, on-site laundry, nice people, fast response to pay for the site Cons: VERY tight/crowded, not all amenities/facilities work at any given time (pool, BBQ, bar/restaurant, laundry machines, etc.), problem neighbor that lives in 3-story orange home at left side of park, no real beach access (just access to launch ramp and rock sea wall), no response to inquiry about when something will be fixed or when an amenity will be ready for use, oh and VERY tight (sardines come to mind).

Our disappointment was in the price being a bit too much for inconsistent amenities and having to deal with the neighboring 'home' built too close to (or rather 'in) the RV parking spaces and the owner being a bit aggressive about his territory.  This is not an RV Park for anyone that wants a view or good beach access or close access to Loreto itself.

My in-laws stayed in a suite with its own living room area.    This is a newly built, large two story building with parking immediately in front of the room and the Wi-Fi worked great.

We stayed for a week November 3 thru 10-2017 . Upon arriving we were met By Lynn (owner) and she showed us around the property and our unit . The Mango deck has good privacy with a distant view of the ocean. It is a short walk to the shell and sand beach and town.  The unit is just right for 2 people very comfortable and clearly met our needs. Randy and Lynn provided bikes  for us to ride to town .  Randy on our first day was very kind to take us to the store so we could pickup some groceries and take us to the bank to exchange our money for pesos.  We got some good advice as to places to eat . Orlando's was our favorite. Randy also made arrangements for a boat to take us for a few hours to Coronado island  for snorkeling and a nice beach to swim.  The property has a nice pool,50,728
 to cool down and and loungers to relax in. It was a very quiet restful stay and We can not say enough about our excellent Hosts Randy and Lynn as well as the house keeper who did our laundry and kept our unit clean daily.  We would highly recommend staying here if you come to Loreto   and we look forward to coming back.   Jim and Ann,50,728

"I really enjoyed the all-you-need in this really nice, spacious condo 'Tequilla Sunrise'.  Lots of amenities- big kitchen, living room & bedroom with ensuite.  The property has a wonderful view of sunrises, beach, Islas Coronado & Carmen plus includes a hot tub & chilled pool. With an added bonus of using a bicycle to get into town square (approx -10 min bike ride). Lynn & Randy have lots of contacts for birding, fishing snorkeling & restaurants++.  I plan to go back, if they have room!",50,728
"We rented Tequila Sunrise for 2 weeks. It is comfortable with great furniture and bed, wonderful lighting and everything we needed in the kitchen.It has Gorgeous views of the Sea! We loved the hot tub and the outside areas. We were thankful for the bikes. We went everywhere on them! They also have a double kayak, noodles and yoga mats. Our place was cleaned everyday and they did our laundry! Lynn and Randy arranged our transportation and our sight-seeing trip around Coronado with a wonderful, local fisherman. We can't say enough good things about our experience! We highly recommend this spot!",50,728
"My husband and I spent a week at the Hamman's with friends.  This was our first time in Loreto, and didn't know what to expect, but I can say that I am very happy we chose to stay at the Hamman's over the many places that were available at Loreto Bay.  The Hamman's property is tranquil and beautiful, while the places at Loreto Bay are primarily condo/townhomes stacked together and the streets packed tightly with  cars and people.  Not exactly my idea of a relaxing vacation atmosphere...    The Hamman's property is right on the beach and close to town, so you couldn't ask for a better location.   Randy and Lynn were very accommodating.  They provided us with a list of nearby restaurants and gave us personal recommendations of their favorites.  They arranged for us to go on a",50,728
" fishing trip with a wonderful boat captain named Francisco (see below) and graciously provided us with snorkel gear and a cooler for our trip. The Hammans live on the property and were very helpful when needed, but they also kept to themselves, allowing us and our friends to privately enjoy their beautiful oasis during our stay. There was no one staying at the Mango Deck during most of our stay, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.   As mentioned by others, the place was very clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated with a modern Spanish flair.  Beatrice, our maid, was very friendly and efficient, and should you need it, would have your laundry done in just a couple hours time - where else do you get service like this at such an affordable rate??   Francisco (aka ""Poncho""), our fishing boat captain, is an experienced fisherman who seemed to know exactly where to find the fish, and could tell what kind of fish we had on the line before it even surfaced!  We ended up catching four Red Snapper from which we made the most amazing fish tacos on the BBQ at the Hamman's the next day.  After we were done fishing, Francisco took us to Coronado island and then to La Picazon (yum!) for lunch afterwards.  This a day trip everyone should experience when staying in Loreto!  All in all, we couldn't have made a better choice!  We highly recommend staying at the Hamman's the next time you visit Loreto!",50,728
…,50,728
"I agree with the previous reviews.  Hospitable hosts, homemade Mango jam upon arrival, comfortable, and clean accommodations.  Daily laundry service and I am in Nirvana!!  I am still here, so don't be jealous.  Lynn and Randy provide coolers, bikes, and snorkel gear at no cost.  We stayed in Dolphin Cove for $350.00 a week.  It was all we needed, on the smaller side but very well appointed.  What a great price, our friends had the larger unit Tequilla Sunrise.  It featured a full living room, to be honest, we lived outside so did not use it too much.    The property is walking distance to a large variety of restaurants that are delicious.  Try Loncherio Chayito.  We ate for $17.00 for 4 people lunch/breakfast with beverages.    Would definitely stay here again.",50,728
"We stayed in the Mango Deck casita for a week in November, our first time in Loreto. The accommodations were nice, very clean, bed was comfy. Walking distance to town square, restaurants, shopping. Beach is steps away, but mostly gravel, not really beachy. Lynn and Randy are genial and helpful hosts. Lynn's welcome gift of mango jam is great! Amenities are good, everything works...would be nice to have basics like cooking oil, plastic wrap,and tinfoil provided, that you could replace when used...housekeeping is terrific, they do your laundry!  Overall, very good value, would stay here again...",50,728
"Clean comfortable rooms in the historic center of Loreto. Great location, can walk to everything in the town. Hostal is located a block off the main road so it stays very quiet at night. Abel, the owner, serves coffee in the morning and loves to chat about the history and things to do in Loreto. Highly recommended.",50,729
"Our host was wonderful.  We felt right at home.  The room was large, clean and comfortable.  The communal kitchen was a plus.  The best thing was the location.  We walked all over the touristy part of Loreto with ease.  This allowed us to visit many nice places to eat, the malecon, the beach and the Carnival.  I am so glad we chose this spot to spend some of our vacation.  The only downside was the lock on our room never worked properly but the outside gate was always locked at nigh so it was not really a concern for us.",50,729
"I found Casas Loreto Hostal to be a wonderful place to stay! Abel runs a very good place, it was clean, I felt safe as I was traveling alone. I loved that it was so close to the main square and the beach! I can not say enough about this place. It was my first time staying in a hostal and if all are like this, I will never stay in a hotel again!!! LOVE IT and Abel (super sweet and interesting fellow!)",50,729
"From reasonable prices, a central yet quiet location, and a clean and comfortable room, I was delighted to stay at Abel's hostel.  He's a great host: friendly, fluent in English, knowledgeable about where to find great food and attractions, as well as being so welcoming that I immediately felt at home and had gained a new friend.  Loreto is a wonderful location for a vacation, and I know I'll return to Hostal Casas Loreto again. Hopefully, that won't be long in coming.",50,729
"Abel has made his life's dream come true with this hostal, providing a reasonable priced save place to stay for travelers of all walks of life.  When I stayed there for a week before guiding a trip to the Gray whale breeding lagoons and the Sea of Cortez, I met two couples biking from the US to La Paz, as well as a young family traveling with their two small children form the Yukon Territory.  We cooked dinner together in the small kitchen and swapped stories over morning coffee freshly brewed by Abel . Abel is a wonderful host who will go to any length to make your stay feel comfortable;  and he might wait by the front gate with a worried face when you arrive late from an excursion into the mountains... I made a friend and I can't wait for next time!",50,729
"We stayed in Loreto for about 5 weeks and tried three different places to stay- we were by far the happiest at our final choice- Casas Loreto. The situation is perfect, the rooms are comfortable, clean, and stylish, and the price is good. Lots of hot water, and plenty of excellent coffee in the communal kitchen. Best of all is the owner Abel whose vision made this wonderful place. If we return to Loreto I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!  Muchas Gracias and many hugs to Abel and Estella for a wonderful stay.  xoxo",50,729
"We've been visiting Loreto for a few years now and Hostal Casas Loreto is always our first and only choice. Abel is now not only our host but also a dear friend. He makes you feel at home.  The location is excellent. Close to everything! Rooms are clean and cozy, comfy beds a/c and wifi available, and the shower is clean spacious and always warm.  The kitchen is a life saver when it comes to saving some money and stay in for dinner some nights as well of preparing our own breakfast. Coffee always there in the morning.  Can't wait for our next visit to our home away from home.",50,729
"Just came back from Abel Casas Hostal Loreto. Besides being spotless, quite lovely , reasonably priced and in a fantastic location,  the Owner, Abel Casas,  is a wonderful person. Smart, funny, kind, and supremely helpful. I wish I was still there. I stayed in a regular room and then when I came back I stayed in the suite to treat myself to a little extra room. All the bathrooms are huge with very good hot water. The kitchen space is communal and there's always really good strong coffee. I highly recommend Casas Loreto !!!! Ilook forward to staying there again!",50,729
Casas Loreto is a very clean and quiet hostel with spacious personal rooms. Abel was thoughtful and lovely to talk with and we were pleased to be able to have access to the kitchen. And the fresh roast coffee in the morning is a huge plus! Would definitely recommend.,50,729
"Had a great time!! Nice big room with a great lighty bathroom and great shower. The kitchen is free to use and there is everything you need to cook for hours. Abel, by the way, is a great host and is willing to talk to you about everything, and he can do other stuff to let you privacy if you don't want to talk. Hostal casas loreto is a great place to stay from 1 night to 2 weeks, it feels like home.",50,729
"stayed here because of the location. very old and run down,paint peeling off the ceiling made me get out of bed . mattress on a block of cement. maid was nice and the owner very helpful they were willing to open a back courtyard for us to put our motorcycles in a safe place.i think at one time this was the place but it just having in there now.",20,730
Loreto is quite nice for a day or two This little hotel had good price rooms-all rather shabby but locations central and the upstairs terrace is a relaxing place to watch the world go by Not hugely clean but fine Rooms don't lock but all felt safe!,30,730
"As other people have noted here, this place has seen better days. I'm not sure why they can't throw a coat of paint on the walls in the room. The location is great, and with a bit of TLC, this place could be perfect, but to lie in bed and stare at the water stained ceiling, and the stained up walls makes it a depressing choice. We got a room in the building across the street from the main hotel, as we were told that you could have wifi in the room. The first night was some wifi but, by morning it was gone and it never came back, so don't count on surfing the internet here. The pillows were pretty awful, hard and flat, so we brought in our own from our van. The windows have broken  old Venetian blinds on them that do No good to keep out the light from the porch lights, so the",20,730
" room was light up brightly all night. In a way it's a typical down and dirty experience, which can probably be easily avoided by finding a better option in the neighborhood. We ended up moving right next door and it was only slightly more expensive and way nicer.",30,730
…,30,730
"Not a bad hotel for the price - rooms are clean, wifi worked well, service was good. However our room faced a noisy street which we could hear clearly and the porch light outside shone through a window without a covering. Three double beds and a big shower in the room were nice but wouldn't stay for more than a night or two. Seemed like an old place in need of some fixing up and the noise was very unpleasant. ",20,730
"We stayed a few days in this centrally-located budget hotel.  M$400 for a double room.  This place has seen better days, with everything a bit worn.  Upstairs rooms, not on the street side, have a nice view of The Mission.  There's wi-fi in the lobby.  But the late-night noise, drunks and other altercations, spoiled our stay and would probably not stay there again.  (A much better place - which we discovered at the end of our visit - around the corner is Hostal Casas Loreto!)",30,730
"The only reason to stay at this hotel (or motel) is if you get very late to Loreto on your way to another place, and you just want to sleep a few hours without spending to much money. That is exactly what happened with me, otherwise, if I had the intention to stay for a a couple of day in Loreto, I would choose a better place. Junípero facilities are on both sides of the street, facing each other. Rooms can be very noisy if they are over the street, which is the main traffic street in Loreto, so you better request for a room in the back. Beds are very, very bad, with springs coming out of the mattress... The room I had was definitely not good, but maybe there are better rooms in any of the buildings.  Wi-fi doesn't work in the rooms, except if very near the reception.",40,730

"Quaint four room boutique hotel located in the heart of Loreto.  It has a very friendly vibe partially created by the lush garden area surrounding the rooms.  Fanny is wonderful…. Azul, the parrot, doesn’t care for motorcycles. Lol. We were able to park our bikes inside the gates… not much parking for autos in the gate, however.  The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a small kitchen. The shower was great. WiFi was good. We were here during the NORRA 1000 and our room was quiet!!! Amazing!  We have been to Loreto several times… this is our favorite hotel.",50,731
"Right. No valet parking, no tiki-bar, no 6-star restaurant.  Just well-appointed comfortable rooms with basics for breakfast, shaded portals for relaxing and reading, and the very best of hosts--Steve and Fanny could not have been more pleasant, helpful, thoughtful and  kind.  Readily available for answering questions, providing suggestions or merely inquiring about our health and happiness in such a sweet town. Only a block from the Plaza--and really everything you'd want is within easy strolling distance. We stayed several nights with our 12-yr old grandson. Really enjoyed Loreto nd kayaking, snorkeling, dining and strolling. Could not have been more perfect. No valet parking needed!",50,731
We picked the Iguana Inn because it was in a Baja guidebook not really knowing much about it really.. But we found it to be a wonderful place to spend two days. It's small and intimate. The owners Steve and Fanny are gregarious and know the Baja Peninsula inside out. I wish we could have stayed longer.,50,731
"Recently returned from a one-week stay at Iguana Inn. It was delightful! The location was great, an easy stroll into el Centro and the beaches. Our lovely casita and the beautiful grounds were cute, clean, and comfortable. Our hosts, Fanny and Steve were incredibly friendly, present, and so helpful. I wish I could have stayed longer.",50,731
"We stayed at Iguana Inn for 5days, they were recommended by SEA Kayak Baja with whom we spent a 6day 5 night tour to the islands off the coast of Loreto. This was our first trip to Loreto and didn’t have a clue about travel in and around Loreto. Steve and Fanny gave us instruction on how to get there by taxi from the airport and once there, we were greeted by smiles and hospitality till we left. We stayed there 3 days prior to our kayak trip and 2 days after the trip, they put our luggage, clothes, and other items in a super secure storage room(it’s literally a vault) until we returned from our Kayak trip, FOR FREE! Steve and Fanny gave us suggestions and directions to various restaurants, all of which were fantastic. They directed us to where to shop and even put us onto a",50,731
" great day spa which my wife thoroughly enjoyed!!! One morning we even woke up to fresh squeezed orange juice by Steve. For trips requiring a taxi, the host called trusted taxi drivers that got us to locations in a timely manner. The rooms were clean, the water was hot, the beds were nice, and we were walking distance to anything in Loreto. We felt safe and secure in this little Oasis. The only thing that they didn’t have was a swimming pool, but we’re not much for pools anyway. We would come again, in fact, this will be our go to place in Loreto!  I read one review that talked about a host named Julie. Julie no longer owns Iguana Inn, Steve and Fanny own it and the pride of ownership shows. Steve and Fanny have been in Loreto for decades and they know this little fishing town well.",50,731
…,40,731
"Owners Steve and his wife Fammy and housekeepers were all very professional and friendly.    I stayed two nights, prior to going on a mule pack trip and returned after to meet up with left luggage, Steve nicely stored.   The room is comfortable, the shower was great! The bed and linens fine.  The location is ideal for walking to the Malecon, the town square and Loreto Mission.  Many good restaurants an easy walk away. I will return to Loreto and will book first at Iguana Inn.",50,731
"Loved this spot, cute, quaint and close to everything. Super convenient to the marina, water, stores, and restaurants. We were in the suite that had a kitchenette. Only thing we should have communicated is that we were leaving early to go fishing and they locked the gate and we had to do hope the fence and there is no TV in the room. ",50,731
"When a favorite place changes hands you always worry about going back.  This time there was no worry. The place looks wonderful and to top it off Fanny Y Steve are a delight, always there to be helpful. Now a “more” favorite spot to enjoy over and over.",50,731
"We spent 2 nights at the end of our week in Baja at La Damiana, and couldn't have been happier with the location, facilities and service! The inn is two blocks from the beach, just about across the street from the plaza and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a lovely courtyard, with ample seating, flowers, shady spots, and the kitchen/dining area was well-equipped. The manager worked with us to make sure all of our needs were met.",50,732
"Quaint, charming, feel-at-home B&B, perfectly located right at the center of Loreto, 2 min away from its main restaurants and shops, yet surprisingly quiet at night. Open kitchen, if one needs to cook breakfast or something more substantial. Delicious little garden for relaxing. The owner is wonderfully friendly and was very helpful suggesting visits in town and around the region.",50,732
La Damiana is very close to the main road and beach making it easy to walk to all the great restaurants and shops. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Staff and owners were kind with great recommendations. A nice perk was the filtered water!,50,732
"We have stayed at La Damiana Inn at least 6 times and it is always a great experience.  The rooms are tastefully decorated, clean, roomy and the beds comfortable.  Debra and Geraldo are the best, they know Loreto and offer their local knowledge.  The garden has many areas that offer places to relax.  The community kitchen gives you the opportunity to have a leisurely breakfast and meet the other guests before heading out for the day.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else.",50,732
"Genuine and rustic. Debora and Gerardo made our stay wonderful. Good location right off the main street, close to the local bookstore, an ATM and the supermercado. Kudos to the house cat that is asleep all the time. Very quiet here. No street noise and no dust in the Inn. A pot of coffee is on early in the morning.",50,732
"I discovered La Damiana after staying in another larger, more pretentious, and MUCH more expensive hotel in Loreto.  La Damiana is perfect and is now my new go-to place in town.  Debora and Gerardo and genuinely warm and enthusiastically welcoming.  The inn is in the perfect location, just a block from the central plaza and the mission.  The building is charming, spacious, and homey.  I had the two room suite upstairs, which was a real treat.",50,732
"We stayed only one night, though we wished we could stay longer. The inn itself is beautifully done, converted from an old house. I loved the communal kitchen area and the garden. Debora and Gerardo were both very welcoming and friendly, giving us good suggestions for dog-friendly options for the evening. We could easily walk to the plaza and along the malecón. Highly recommend this hotel!",50,732
La Damiana Inn was awesome.  The accommodations were excellent and It was like a retreat place.  Debra and Itzel were marvelous hosts and so accommodating.  I highly recommend this Inn to travelers.  It is centrally located to the plaza and many wonderful restaurants. I know I will be coming back soon.,50,732
"Beautiful ambiance, friendly and helpful staff, and comfortable environment. We came in June which turns out to be the beginning of the hot season and we were so thankful for the air conditioning. The community style kitchen was great and had ample supplies. Gerardo, Itzel, and Deborah were very welcoming and helpful and made everything run smoothly. Thank you!",50,732
"This Inn is truly authentic Mexico! My room had comfortable bed, a private bathroom with shower, A/C, and a ceiling fan. There was a community kitchen which was the heart of the Inn. Geraldo, the owner, welcomed guests and with his gentle manner, pulled people together. He even ""waited up"" for me to return from an evening excursion!! I traveled solo but NEVER felt alone - the town is safe, super-friendly, and walkable! The Inn is nestled in the center of town, it allowed easy access to restaurants, car rental/taxi stand, and tour groups. Geraldo made fabulous recommendations: (i.e. Orlando's was a fantastic restaurant of the main area), Augies bar on the Malecon with happy hour from 3:00 - 8:00 with music and ample shady 'nooks' for resting and relaxing. I will be back !! Email",50,732
"One of the (US) owners on our arrival was very rude to our (there were 4 of us) Mexican guide and to my (non-white) partner, asking him whether he was staying there. I imagine that, as my partner was non-white, he assumed that he was just a helper for our group. One has the impression he prefers guests to be of a particular profile, ethnic or otherwise. The same person also decided unilaterally to change our departure time from the B&B the next day (without reference to the four of us and our driver), perhaps because that would allow him to prepare the breakfast at the time when he wanted. If you like that kind of treatment and also being told the breakfast you will be eating, with no alternative (which was offered to other guests but not to my partner), if you like not getting",20,733

The rooms were comfortable, when they were made up (effectively on 1 day out of 4). This B&B is not close to the old centre, so unless you have a car or a driver you will have to take an Uber.

The bedroom suites are magnificent, most overlook the pool and the bathrooms have all the amenities as well as an overhead rain shower which opens to a private jungle of vines added to the atmosphere of a tropical paradise.

"Dave & Patrick have a beautiful little oasis in the middle of Merida.  They did a fantastic job of making us feel like part of the family from the minute we walked in the door. Cocktail hour by the pool and entertainment from the crew of friendly great little dogs all looking for a pet or scratch.   Breakfast was amazing with fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, homemade English muffins (thanks Patrick) and fresh coffee and juice.   All advice on where to visit in the city or restaurants to eat were all great recommendations.   Don’t forget to ask Dave about his newly published book ‘The Seasons of Grace’ which was such a good read that I couldn’t put it down until I was done.  We will be back for sure!",50,733
"We had the best time at Ochenta Y Dos. The room was beautiful, the pool was glorious, and the food was beyond  our expectations. Dave and Patrick went out of their way to make sure we were having a good time, even organizing massages and Covid tests for the trip home. We did 4 different tours with Dave which were interesting and educational. Would 100% recommend a stay here!!",50,733

We stayed at Boutique By The Museo [ my wife and two children ] last week and we absolutely loved it. The staff were brilliant and helped us with every question we had. The building has been recently fully restored to its full colonial opulence and the quality of the restoration is absolutely fantastic. The attention to detail in every aspect of this hotel reveals a passion for excellence. The rooms were beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable.  There's a lovely pool in the courtyard. The breakfast was great and we were offered three different varieties of sourdough bread! [ I like my sourdough bread ] It's not a cheap option but I don't mind paying when the product is this good. I would thoroughly recommend Boutique By The Museo.,50,734
"This was the most magical and amazing stay in Merida! My entire family and I stayed here to celebrate my wedding. The hotel owner and hotel staff thought of everything. The service was unmatched. Each morning they served an incredible breakfast, often left thoughtful notes or gifts for us in our room, and helped with anything we needed. All the staff speak English and Spanish. The rooms were beautiful and immaculately clean. The location couldn’t have been more perfect. Everything was walking distance and when we did need transportation the hotel helped us set it up including helping us plan excursions. The food was also so fresh and tasty.

If you are looking for a professional, friendly and comfortable stay at a boutique oasis with a pool in the middle of Merida, look no further than the Merida Santiago Hotel Boutique. We will return again and again – even after we coordinate with Rita about potentially buying our own place down there at some point in the future! We left the hotel with the hopes of returning real soon, but more importantly with a lot of new friends that we now consider part of our extended family!",50,735

"We had breakfast here in early March 2022. It was fantastic; the little Dutch pancakes with strawberry sauce were perfectly light and sweet. The chilaquiles were incredible. Service is fast, professional, and super friendly! The small dining area is poolside and spotlessly clean. Highly recommended as a charming and delicious breakfast spot.",50,735
"Beautiful hotel, staff so friendly and helpful. They organised everything we wanted to do. Our bed was extremely comfortable and the room was large and quiet.  The breakfasts were exceptionally good. We had dinner and can strongly recommend.",50,735
I stayed in the Superior Suite for a week when visiting in January 2022. Everything about the stay was fantastic! The room was large and clean (same with bathroom). The meals were fantastic and incorporated Yucatan cuisine. The property is delightful and COVID protocol were strictly followed. My favorite were the staff -- they went over and above to make sure I had a wonderful first time in Merida. I wish I could have stayed longer!,50,735
"La Familia Magaña recently stayed at the Merida Santiago Hotel Boutique for 3 nights just before Christmas.  This hotel is truly a Pearl located just minutes from the center of town.    Mario, MariaJose, Nelli and the rest of the staff were extremely nice and made our stay very enjoyable - we thank all of you!    The breakfasts created by the Chefs were beautifully plated and delicious.  Marco(?), Mario, and MariaJose made tasty drinks and the dinner we had on our last night was top notch.    Mario was very accommodating throughout our stay who even assisted in securing a driver to take us to the Uxmal Ruins.    The double-bed room we were in was very spacious for 4 people to include a huge bathroom.  The property is well maintained and very clean.    Again, thanks to all of you",50,735
 for a wonderful stay at this hidden gem in Merida.,50,735

"Very cozy and excellent hotel. The food was amazing. As a family we decided to stay at the hotel for dinner and it was very delicious. It is also possible to have tequila decustations. The staff is multilingual, very nice and make the hotel feel like home.",50,735
When visiting los arcos david always makes his guest feel welcomed and comfortable.He goes out of his way to make everything feel like home.He can be engaging or let you enjoy your quiet time if needed.rooms are very comfortable and appointed nicely and i always look forward to my next stay at his place.,50,736
"We ran around the Yucatan for two weeks, but the last week at Los Arcos was the cherry on top of a great trip. As always, David was the perfect host. The eclectic character of his establishment and his overwhelming generosity made our stay very relaxing and left us with a feeling of being home again. There is no place like Los Arcos and no host that cares more about his guests than David. Don't miss stopping by, specially now when things are opening up!",50,736
"We were the last guests to stay with wonderful David prior to shut down of tourist venues etc. in Merida for COVID-19.  I can not state in words what David's warmth and caring meant to us, particularly in this time of uncertainty.  We had to cut our visit short to fly back to US.  David did everything he could by calling friends in the travel industry to get us the latest travel information.  He literally served as our mom with his caring and concern.  His personally-curated home is absolutely gorgeous and comfortable.  The double-room casita was just stellar, the most beautiful room and setting of all our stays in Mexico.  I'm sure everybody has mentioned his breakfast, so tasty and beautifully presented pool-side.  The location of the home is perfect for a quick walk to",50,736
" historic center, all of the sites, etc.  Communication with David before we arrived was fabulous.  Because we'd been traveling all over Mexico on planes, crowds and buses, David was at risk to himself and his housekeeper having us there.  But you would never know it for his level of hospitality and personal concern were beyond amazing.  We can't wait to continue our visit with David in Merida as soon as possible.  I hope that David's hospitality is never tested again in this way and that he will enjoy a plethora of guests soon.  We will certainly be amongst them.",50,736

"Having read quite a few of the many, many five star reviews  Los Arcos has here,  I am faced with the challenge of saying something that has not already been said. Hmm, well, let's start by saying that all those other five star reviews are not exaggerating . This really is the best of the best if what you want is to feel  welcomed, well cared for...spolied perhaps...like you have arrived at the home of a relative who missed you and is delighted to see you. Your host is David Reed;  gentleman , bon vivant, font of local knowledge. I wouldn't want to deprive news guest of the pleasure of hearing the Los Arcos story told by the man who made it happen, but suffice it to say that this place is actually more interesting than most of the museums in the city (and has more stuff to look",50,736
" at!). The house is a beautifully and lovingly restored small mansion which has retained its original charm while being upgraded to 21st century living standards .  David is an avid (understatement of the century) collector of antiques and art and each room in the house is overflowing with interesting things . If you are interested you might get a guided tour .  He won't tell you this himself , but David is also an accomplished artist and some of those paintings are his (oops, I spilled the beans).  You'll walk through the house to the garden and swimming pool/ terrace area which is spacious , sunny and delightful to spend time in. On sunny days you will have breakfast in the garden. Be warned that ""breakfast"" is usually a meal that will set you up until dinner and no matter how long you stay there (ten days in my case) you won't ever get quite the same breakfast twice. There are two comfortable , antique and art filled guest rooms at the end of the garden . Despite being located very near restaurants and clubs and the historical center , you will find that these rooms get no street noise at all. David knows everything you need to know about Merida and is full of helpful tips and suggestions.  His friend Jose can drive you and guide you to many places outside the city (I had a great day seeing ruins, swimming in a cenote and visiting the sea shore town of Progresso). However, my best memories of Los Arcos are sitting in the garden with a cigar (designated smoking area) and swapping stories with David . Look up  ""gentleman"" in the encyclopedia and you will find his picture there.",50,736
…,50,736
"we have been going to merida for the last ten years. we have stayed at Loas Arcos every time, without exception. Given that we are treated like returning family why would  we go anywhere else! David reed is the perfect host and has not slowed down in these last 10 years! It is and will continue to be our home away form home!",50,736
"What a pleasure to have spent the last two weeks of January with David Reed at Los Arcos. Our expectations were high, given the steady stream of consistently stellar Trip Advisor reviews. But they were exceeded in every respect. Located in Centro, Los Arcos is steps from three excellent restaurants and the English library and an easy walk to the attractions of Plaza Santa Lucia, Plaza Grande and Paseo de Montejo. The street entrance to Los Arcos does not prepare one for what lies within. David’s home is a spectacular three-story renovation of the original property with two comfortable air-conditioned casitas separated from the main house by a luxuriant tropical oasis with terrace and plunge pool. Our mornings began there with breakfast. We retreated there at the end of the day",50,736
"Cascadas is a wonderful place to stay in Mérida.  Its location is within easy walking distance to Centro and many restaurants.  Whilst walking to Centro you really get a sense of ""old Mérida"". Our Hosts, Ellyn and Chucho provided an amazing amount of information; historical, cultural and current. We learned a massive amount from them during our 10 day stay.  The house itself is charming and restful.  The breakfasts were outstanding.  I strongly recommend a stay here.",50,737
"This is  a 4 bedroom bed and breakfast with kingsized beds.  Very pleasant, well kept and perfectly clean.  Some places have breakfast...this place has a breakfast that is unmatched.  The kind of breakfast that makes you want to linger and talk.   The place has a nice clean pool and poolside tables that invite you to read or converse with guests in the evening.  Another plus is that within a couple blocks of Cascadas is a small plaza with inexpensive outdoor restaurants to enjoy in the evening.  Local kids always seem to be practicing for some kind of dance there so it provides entertainment that is low-key and enjoyable. This is the second time we have stayed at Cascadas and we would heartily recommend it as a great place to stay in Merida.",50,737
"Hospitality reigns in this Merida treasure!  Owners Ellyne and Chucho offer the perfect mix for guests with a warm welcome, local food and knowledge of the area.  Every morning we were welcomed by fresh coffee and great breakfasts that included hot local dishes, fresh fruit, breads, and more.  The rooms are spacious and attractively decorated and the views into the inner courtyard with its stonework, greenery and blue pool was a welcome sight during the hot days of February.  Each of the four casitas offers quiet privacy as they are located at each corner of the property with the central courtyard/pool offering an attractive gathering place or quiet reflection. In addition, Ellyne provided informed assistance to us by arranging wonderful tours in the area and recommending a",50,737
" variety of experiences in the immense local arts scene, other daily events and new places to dine.  Cascadas de Merida is truly a home away from home with the warmest hosts and a wonderful place to stay in the Yucatan!",50,737
…,50,737
"Staying here was like staying with family. Ellyn is one of the best hosts with whom we have  stayed in our many travels.  The place is comfortable and offers multiple extra features like a fruit drink offered in the afternoon and a couple of glasses of wine available free every day when you want it. Breakfasts are ample and delicious with local fresh fruits and a cooked dish. Our host set up tours for us, offered local advice, and even arranged an inexpensive car rental to drive to the ruins.  I will make this my home whenever I visit Merida and I suggest you spend a while here as well.",50,737
"We hade a great time in Merida during our 4 night-stay at the Cascadas. It felt like an oasis after a hot day in the sun (even though supposedly 'cold' by Mexican standards..), where we could relax by the pool and restore our energy. Ellyne was just the best host and really made sure our stay was perfect, answering all our questions, providing us with all kinds of information re Merida and surroundings, and made us feel right at home. The Cascadas is situated in a nice neighbourhood about a 15 min walk from the very center. If you've got a car it's easy to park in the street and access the main roads for daytrips. And the breakfast - wow! It was truly a luxury to be presented with fresh fruits and different Yucatecan breakfasts each morning, something we much appreciated. It was",50,737
" delicious and plentiful!   We really enjoyed our stay and it was wonderful to meet both Ellyne and her husband, they are great people! I can't recommend this place enough. If in Merida again in the future, I'll definitely be looking to stay here again.",50,737
…,50,737
"We LOVED staying at the Cascadas de Merida - the property is very well located (close to centro), super charming and absolutely spotless!! Our room was very clean, generous in size, had a very comfortable bed, a wonderful bathroom - with plenty of hot water, air conditioning, wifi, TV, and was just a hop, skip and a jump to the pool. Breakfast was provided and it was plentiful, fresh, and delicious! The staff working with Ellyne and Chucho were helpful, polite and very attentive. Ellyne and Chucho are such wonderful people... SO kind, knowledgeable and helpful! We stayed in a couple places during our three weeks in the Yucatan + this was by far our favorite and best experience. Thank you Ellyne and Chucho… hopefully we'll see you again next year.",50,737
"I literally stumbled upon this gem while exploring Merida (was in Yucatan for 6 weeks) and Jaime kindly ushered me in and to my utter delight, found an oasis of beauty, calm and utter chic. Having a very early flight back, I immediately booked it and it was STUPENDOUS! I wish I had been able to stay longer but that will be for the next time.  The attention to detail and design is sublime and tasteful and I wish I could live there all the time... It transports you back to a time where life was more simple and a slower pace.Lovingly restored but with a nod to modernism, it is a true jewel. The staff is quite lovely and responsive to any request. My only slight criticism is there were a lot of leaves in the pool (if a skimmer was there, I would have gladly used it). I can NOT wait",50,738
 to return and enjoy it for a longer period of time. Muchas Gracias,50,738

"Brand-new boutique hotel.   They have wonderfully restored a colonial building preserving its character while also introducing new architectural concepts, like the bar and restaurant area opening on a modernly-designed swimming pool. Check the cocktail menu.   Very quiet and discreet but still very central, excellent quality of sleep.",50,738
"Villa Verde is a perfect bed and breakfast if you want to avoid the crowds and if you are looking for a personal and private atmosphere. I would definitely recommend the place - in particular to couples. A few details haven't been perfect though and I wonder if the hosts have lost a little bit of their enthusiasm over the years? A few details in the room, the showers, the safe, TV didn't work (we didn't need it), the very limited breakfast (no buffet, no question like: do you need anything elso, second serving....) at one certain point in the morning (it's nine or never) ... none of these aspects were really important and they certainly didn't dilute the pleasure to stay at this marvellous house, but perhaps something to think about just in order to keep up the very very high",50,738

"Centrally located, a quiet and luxurious oasis walking distance to all the major sites of downtown Merida. The hosts have lovingly restored the casa to it's colonial grandness and added a swimming pool and relaxing garden. True home made breakfast is  served each morning and the ""staff"" Felipe is sweet beyond compare.  Always helpful and offering suggestions your hosts truly make you feel like you are with family.",50,738
"Villa Verde is a beautiful quiet oasis in the middle of Merida.  Merida is a vibrant, interesting, friendly city in the Yucatan.  We spent several days there in February, with Villa Verde providing a relaxing respite when as we wound down with wine or a beer after an eventful day exploring Merida or the nearby Mayan ruins.  Villa Verde is a gorgeous place, with a pool and a garden in the back, beautifully decorated.  The breakfasts were excellent, and the ownes provided excellent recommendations on what to see and where to eat.  We had a fantastic tiem and would definitely recommend.",50,738
"Villa Verde is a very special place to stay in lovely Merida.  Location is excellent - loved being close to Santa Lucia, great restaurants and shops.  The owner/host Robert was beyond helpful.  He provided so many suggestions, maps, destinations which were perfect for our first time visit. Breakfasts were different and delicious each of our 6 mornings.  The room could have used a bit of freshening but I will still give it 5 points for the quality of hospitality.",50,738
Outstanding experience. George and Sarah the proprietors couldn’t have been more gracious. Delicious breakfast every day. Great location.  And Aaron the manager arranged amazing trips and guides to xenotransplantation and Chichen Itza.,50,739
"Just spent a week at Casa Del Maya and had a wonderful stay. The location is perfect (situated between the two best areas of the city, Paseo de Montejo and the Plaza Grande) and the staff very helpful. We needed a driver, a taxi, dinner reservations, Covid tests, etc., and Aaron was helpful well beyond the call duty. Our room was simple but more than adequate and the breakfasts were delicious. All around a great experience!",50,739
We really regret not to stay longer! The staff was very friendly and gave us good recommendations for activity and restaurant.  The breakfast is really good and changed every day during our stay. This is a small hotel very cosy with an amazing value for money.,50,739
"It is an oasis tucked away in the busy streets of Merida. Once you go through the door, everything changes and becomes serene and beautiful. It is a very well done place with great staff. The owner is very attentive. The room we stayed in was very spacious and very comfortable. Location is excellent. If you are looking to stay in Merida for a few days, this place is perfect. I will recommend this place to friends.",50,739
"We had the most wonderful stay at Casa del Maya. The house is wonderful, with very relaxing green areas to rest after a long day walking. My favorite was “La Palapa”, where I took a “siesta” every day during our three days there (and I’m never able to take a siesta at home!). The rooms were booked, but we could say we had the house just for ourselves. The rooms are big, nicely decorated, and the shower is fantastic.  There are mosquito repellent, sunscreen and sunburn cream for the guest to use free of charge. Plenty of water for you to refill your water bottles as well. The day we went to the Cenotes, Aaron had a bag ready for us with towels for our day trip. Breakfast was delicious and the cinnamon rolls to die for! But the best part were Sonny, Aaron and the three girls",50,739

Walking around in the heat it was so wonderful to return to the cool tranquility of Casa del Maya. We had 2 double beds in our room which was bliss! Breakfast different every day and the owner Sonny was always on hand for help and advice as was Aaron.,50,739
"This was only my second trip to Mexico, and I do not speak Spanish well at all - so it was my luck and good fortune to have booked our stay at Casa Del Maya! This wonderful B & B is a rare gem that exists in the old historic district of the city; walking distance from a slew of great restaurants, bars, and shops, as well as the grand Paseo Montejo area. The staff is professional, warm and you want to bring them all home with you. Aaron is especially wonderful and sees to any needs you have, schedules tours, taxis, and Covid tests - so we could return to the U.S., not that we were eager to leave! Sonny, the owner, is delightful and as much a work of art as the place itself! We loved our conversations with him. Beautiful breakfasts, beautiful surroundings, lovely care and comfort",50,739

"Our family generally stays at chain hotels, and we were hesitant to book at this small boutique because of that -- however, we were swayed by the reviews. To say we were happy with that decision would be an understatement.   From the time we booked, Sara was extremely helpful and communicative. We had many requests and asked her to help us arrange restaurant reservations, tours, COVID tests to return to the US, etc. She did so with ease and always kept us in the loop.   Service at the Diplomat was absolutely incredible. We were greeted when we arrived by Edith, and shown to our room, where a margarita was waiting. we were the only guests on property the first night, which was an amazing experience. The rooms are beautiful, with spacious bathrooms as well. The pool area and bar",50,740
" made our friends back at home very jealous.   The main purpose of our trip was to see Chichen Itza, and Sara organized a private tour for us with Raul. We have had many, many tour guides in countries around the world, and Raul was perhaps the best that we have ever met. I STRONGLY recommend booking a tour with him through Sara. We left early in the morning for Chichen, and had a lovely to-go breakfast to take with us.   We spent the rest of the weekend lounging around the hotel and walking around Merida. Sara provided great recommendations for dinner, and we loved both Oliva and Picheta. We also had time to chat with both Sara and Neil about their travels and living in Merida, and were blown away by their hospitality.   To summarize, we don't have enough good things to say about The Diplomat. I would return in a heartbeat, and have already recommended the property to many friends.   Thank you, Sara and Neil, for a wonderful weekend in Merida!",50,740

"The Diplomat was our first stop on a special birthday trip.  The rooms are comfortable, large, and beautifully appointed (we were in the Paramount); the grounds green; the pool tranquil; the breakfast delicious.  The staff are lovely and the owners are charming and kind.  Given the beautiful photos on their site, and their consistently high TripAdvisor reviews, we had high expectations, which were all exceeded.",50,740
"The Diplomat Hotel has a perfect location, outstanding local breakfast, lovely pool and beautiful rooms.  But what will bring us back to the hotel is the incredibly warm and inviting hospitality provided by Sarah and the Diplomat team.  We had a lot of logistical changes between making the booking and actually arriving, and Sarah was so helpful in making reservations, changing the reservations and then changing them again.  As hotels try to outdo themselves in luxuries and amenities, the only thing that truly distinguishes them is a sincerely welcoming atmosphere and the warmth and helpfulness of the staff.  Diplomat has this in spades:  we wouldn't stay anywhere else in Merida.",50,740
"A boutique hotel, only few rooms, nice pool, delicious breakfast, very calm and tranquil surroundings and absolutely the best host Sara. She is so charismatic and sweet person that I could not forget my stay in her hotel until now. She perfecty and very professionally organised all our trips, found the best guides, gave us best suggestions what to see and visit. It is a  4-5 star hotel of really high standards. The hotel is quite far from the city center. So if you have no car consider taking an uber to go to city center or restaurants. An uber is realy very  cheap.  What could be improved: a pillow was very hard for me, had to sleep without any , it would be good to have two: soft and hard (according to a customer habits). No small towels for face in a room. It is not the must",50,740
 but would be convenient to have. No safety box. But realy you do not need it. TV faces to the wall not to beds in the room but there we do not require it at all. Breakfast  starts  from 8:30 but if you need it earlier for your trips you get a package with breakfast items.,50,740

Outstanding! Wonderful! Comfortable! Delicious! Excellent! Will return! What more can be said?!? Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Diplomat Boutique Hotel in charming Merida.  Sara and Neil and Carla and Paola and Renata are so welcoming and helpful.  Been thinking about our visit ever since we left!,50,740
"Sara and Neil are the absolute best!  They are so accommodating and make you feel like family the second you walk in.  I have Celiac disease and they went out of their way to make sure there were gluten-free options.  They want you to the have an amazing time in Merida so they spend time walking you through the places to see and shops to go to.  They have relationships with all the best restaurants and attractions and were able to get us reservations.  Still our best meals in Merida were the breakfasts at The Diplomat!    The hotel itself is so cool.  Each room is different, but incredibly comfortable and well thought-out.  We spent a lot of time in the pool out back with Diplomat margaritas in hand!  My wife and I will definitely be heading back and can't thank Sara and Neil",50,740
"The staff was was beyond very good in all areas of service, from dining, to rooms, and concierge. The made my visit vacation and business a pleasure. We were able to book outings, had a special business use of conference areas, and the Fiesta Inn Merida really showed up 110%...Thank you!",50,741
"Located in the developing outskirts (industrial zone) of Merida, the inn has one advantage: it is walking distance to a supermarket and the anthropological museum. Looking for culture? You may be out of luck - 30 min drive to the vibrant center with all its bars and music. But the reason for giving 1 star was serious miscommunication with the 'management', or complete lack thereof. I was there for a planned stay of five days, three covered by the local research institute and the inn had my credit card on file. My partner receives a call on day three to send people to pack up my luggage. That was it. No note, like hey we noticed you are still around, or receipt the night before, with a can we help you? I felt evicted and humiliated. For me, they ruthlessly broke number one rule",10,741
 for hosts: take care of your guests and treat them with respect. Catastrophic!,50,741

During a business trip traveling with my 15 month old daughter I was received by my name and with an essence of hospitality rarely found nowadays.   The Junior Suite was large enough for my daughter and me. Ample space for her to run around. The decoration and amenities up to par and above expectations for the price.   24hour room service is excellent for any late night or early morning needs. The menu is very varied.  The restaurant service is also phenomenal. Everyone greets you by name and stay on top of your needs without fail.   A great first experience and certainly not the last.,50,741
"When you arrive with a car....you are in level 0...nowhere to park near the door to get the lluggages out...have to use valet parking which I did not want....we felt rushed...checkin was ok but quiet ong. Staff not very freindly...it was xmas...Restaurant food was good but temperature could have been better...and I was sinck after eating a hamburger....hotel is new well decorated, roojms look great . Perfume toilet paper whchi is bad...Very clean hotel.  Too bad the towels are cheap ...Pool area is good but the jacuzzi part was dirty...Will not stay since parking is far when you are with your luggages ....",40,741
This is a modern high rise hotel in the northern part of Merida.  It is quiet and has all the amenities of a we;ll established hotel.  I made a mistake of not booking enough nights and the staff was extremely polite and accommodating for my mistake.The floor numbering is a little odd.  You enter the hotel on Floor 0.  You then take the elevator up one floor to the lobby - Floor L.  The next floor up is Floor 1.,40,741
"The hotel is located at the commercial area of Merida.  Nearby there is a mall and supermarket, so the location is very good and convenient for travelers.  Although is far from the old center of the city.  The entrance is a bit strange, as you do not enter the hotel immediately, but you enter to a small informal lobby and then on the third floor you do your check in.   The rooms are fine although they could have a little more details.   The service is good, focused on executives.  Nice stay.",50,741
"Quite the new trendy spot. Little pricey. However, it is built for trendy, middle class to rich folks, either visiting or living in Mexico. Clean with new TV, lots of plug ins. Valet service was with the booking. Plenty of good options for food and drinks in the lobby area. ",30,741
"Stayed here for a week for a business trip. The accommodation, facilities and service were absolutely excellent. I had no complaints at all. The only thing I had an issue with was the fact that not too many of the staff spoke English which was a challenge at times but we were in Mexico after all so I won’t count that against the hotel or staff too much. For the price, amenities and service, Fiesta Inn ticks all the boxes. I will definitely recommend it and I would definitely return if I’m ever in Merida again. ",30,741
"Great price,  the hotel it is located outside of the city center, not close to the attractions, would need to use Uber or have a car. The hotel was clean and had a fridge and is across the street from Costco and shopping center. There was a museum across the street. Front desk was kind enough to located a laundry mat that was 3 minutes away.",40,742
"I stayed with family at this hotel in July '17. It's very basic, no proper restaurant but new and with walking distance to shopping centres. We had breakfast and dinner in the many restaurants at the shoppIng centres.  This hotel is in a very convenient place to travel to Progreso beach, Chichén-Itza and different ""cenotes"".  It doesn't have many rooms and is a small hotel, rooms have cooking facilities, mini fridge and a sink. There's a small pool at the hotel but we didn't use it. Good place to stay if you plan to go out, enjoy Mérida and just wash and sleep at the hotel.  Staff were very nice and helpful.",30,742
"If you check my reviews you will see that I call it as I experience it.  Do not use this hotel or Orbitz to book it!!!!   We are going to have to work with Visa to help us get something done.  After we checked in and stayed BECAUSE ALMOST ALL HOTELS WERE BOOKED, we tried to check out before noon.  We couldn't because their ""system had us staying longer and they couldn't change the computer"". We left with a lot of arguing and trying to call Orbitz -as of yet No help! Please learn from our terrible experience.  Read the fine and finer and invisible print. Just stay away. It looks like we will be paying for 3 rooms for a week without being there. That translates to a lot of money that they are stealing from us.",10,742
"This is the worst hotel I have stayed in Merida, filthy everywhere, mildew in the showers, don´t be  fooled by the location this is far from downtown. At 4 am someone was working, hammering somewhere in the hotel. Stay way from this place, Merida has much more to offer. We booked for two nights and had to look for another hotel as were not going to stay another night although they took our money.",10,742
Merida was full so we stayed here and liked it. It is quite new so it is very clean- hopefully they manage to maintain it that way. Taxi to center is approx 100 pesos and museum us across the street. Don't expect too much from the poll restaurant which is a pity as it is pleasant setting in natural shade-they should definitely upgrade this. The only annoying thing which i normally hate and find to be gross is that drain in the shower did not work. This is why cleaning lady cannot clean it fully and otherwise they really do a good job. Front office staff is very helpful and nice. Elderly gentleman in his 50s was very helpful and spoke excellent english. I recommend staying here but make sure your drain works.,40,742
"When I was looking for a hotel in Merida for a three days/four nights stay I was looking for a place very close to the Plaza de la Independencia to have my morning walks and breakfast in the centre, then walk the city, get back to the hotel, relax a little and get out again for further exploring and dinner. I had three places in my short list and finally decided for this place. One, a very import point for my decision, was the very close proximity to the centre. As shown on Google maps it was supposed to be a five minutes walk. That was the plan. Then I got to Merida and when telling the taxi driver the name of the place he said this is way outside the city. I said, no, it must be right in the centre and showed him the direction on the Google map. He said we can pass by there",20,742
" but there will be no hotel. And he was right. We then went off to the right direction -  a 30 minute drive in taxi outside the city!   When getting to the hotel I was very angry and told the guys at the reception that they have a wrong direction on their page and that Google shows the hotel at one block away from plaza majority right in the middle of the centre of Merida. Instead they are so far away. They told me they had these complains before -  then I wonder why didn't they change it asap!?  I find it completely unacceptable that a wrong direction is given only to attract travelers to this place. I would have never ever stayed in the Siglo 21 - knowing what I wanted to do in Merida - if I would have known that it is a 30 minute taxi drive outside of town. And it's not only about the additional costs (at least the hotel payed the first drive into town, which still was only half what I payed for the searching drive with the taxi, but at least they did this), it's even more about the lost time. Going twice you sit two hours in the traffic instead of wandering the old city.   The hotel itself is completely new. Rooms are big, have comfortable beds, a safe in the room, air conditioning and a big shower. But you only have options to hang your clothes, not even one board in the closet. In the back is a nice pool, which gives you the choice of sitting in the shadow or the sun. If you are lucky enough to get one of the rooms facing the pool than you get out of the noise that comes from the very crowded street that passes right in front of the hotel. It's the main street passing to Progresso. But it's not helping you to save you from the loud music that comes from a nearby market that kicked me out of my bed at 6:50 on a Saturday morning.   So, the place itself is really nice, only in the wrong place and with noise issues. If you don't plan to visit the city often, if you plan on purpose to stay outside the city, if you are here for nearby businesses, if you travel the surrounding areas,  then that's your place. But no restaurant or shopping close by. At least not if you don't need 5 liter bottles of juice or 2 liter bottles of body lotions sold by the Costco across the street.   Because of having really crossed my travel plans with wrong Informations I only can give a maximum of two stars. And these I give for the nice place itself and especially for the very nice people working in the hotel. I got very nice service and treatment.  If you want to know where the place is check on Google maps or Google Earth for ""Restaurant Familia Espadas de Rio Lotorros"". This must have been the place before, on Google Earth you see how the building looks from outside. If this doesn't help search for ""Gran museo del mundo maya"". That's on the other side of the street. I hope this review helps travellers from being unintentionally on the wrong area of town.",50,742
"Stayed here for one night. Place was filthy. I left and requesred a credit. After my airbnb review period was up, he left a review on me recommended not to rent to me. The sheets were filthy. Mattress was filthy and when I complained I was told that americans come over here expecting standards like the states. Not but I don't expect filthy. ",10,743
"Location is a bit remote but worth the trip. Beautiful well manicured in the accommodations are totally well maintained. I think I have never seen such perfect maintenance on any accommodation in Mexico Staff is also excellent and very accommodating.I don't often mention names of the employees but in this case I will. Mary Jose, from the front office, went above and beyond for any request. Even put number on my Cellular in case I needed anything. So it's very helpful. I highly recommend this place. ",50,743
Beds were comfortable and room a good size. We thought it wouldn’t be too bad staying out of town but you can’t rely on ubers - the front desk can order taxis to be booked for a certain time and this was most reliable Option -  it was also sometimes hard to get a taxi back from town. The breakfast is not great a tasteless and cold they have about 5 hot options but don’t book here for the breakfast.,30,744
We stayed here the night before our flight back to the states.  They set up our required travel Covid test and a doctor came to the hotel and completed the test. The staff spoke excellent English.  Highly recommended ,50,744

Jacobo,  one of the men who work at the desk helping guests , gave me great ideas of places to visit.  The breakfast each morning was hot and delicious. During covid I did not expect this to be provided and was pleasantly surprised at the great food!. When I was having difficulty ordering take out Erick in reception came to the rescue. He was always there with a smile and helped me get my covid test! Montserrat kept my room sparkling clean.  I will most definitely return. Thank you Hampton Inn and Diego for hiring such a great staff! ",50,744

Small bar next to front desk opens @noon.  Nice for overnight.",30,744

"On 3rd party sites, they state coin laundry, as an amenity.   My main purpose of booking hotel was because it stated coin laundry, and I wanted to wash my clothing the way I am used to. Before check out the next morning, I went to front desk and inquired about where was laundry room. I was told by clerk that it was not available that day. I advised her that my only purpose of staying at the hotel was because of the coin laundry they advertised. She got on her computer and stated she would find me one. I advised her that I knew about other coin laundry, but I booked hotel to be able to do laundry. She made a few phone calls, asked me how much laundry I had. I told her 3 bags. It was my daughter and my laundry. She continued to talk on phone. She then stated she could have my",10,745

After hanging up, She handed me a ‘laundry form’ and asked me to fill it out and give her clothes within 15 minutes. I decided to just give her ‘a few items’, and returned her the form and clothing. At 12 noon check out time, I advised her I was sitting in lobby. She acknowledged. Around 1 pm, a housekeeper came and gave her a bag, and she advised me my clothes was ready. I took them and said thank you. She then stated that I needed to pay her. After attempting to charge me $90 usd, my card originally declined and manager was called when i complained and explained situation. Called a friend on phone who spoke with manager about situation. I was then told that manager stated he would discount, because of the misunderstanding. Total $80 USD for 25 pieces of clothing. I was advised by friend to pay it. When I gave them my card again, I was charged, I advised them that I would be reporting the situation. They proceeded to write down my credit card number. I asked why? But no response. Manager then proceeded to go outside, and talk on his phone, at the end of the parking lot, for about 15-20 minutes.",50,745

"This was my first stay at this property, and I will make this my go-to hotel in Merida! I was there for 16 days...  It is basic in its appearance, but I assure you that the rooms are great! The staff are equally great! And even though this hotel is situated along a main street, I never heard a sound in my room. It was truly one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in.  But more than all of that - this being a Holiday Inn Express, you may be reluctant because of the quality of the  ""free"" breakfast. NOT THE CASE HERE! Their breakfast bar is fresh scrambled eggs (not prepackaged). Three types of Fresh Cut Fruits every morning. Real plates and real silverware - and the staff clears your table!  The hotel also  offers a Jura coffee machine that is available near the lobby, 24",30,745
" hours a day.  The hotel is ideally located within a short walking distance of the Zocolo - the main plaza in Merida. Along the walk are two colonial churches, numerous shops, a park, the Cathedral, and the Govorner's Palace, as well as numerous restaurants.  Also, if you rent a car, there is free parking in a public lot. The only caveat is that it is 1 1/2 blocks away. But the hotel staff is always available to retrieve the car for you.  The rooms are high tech in the way they are set up with the key. The keycard is blank (for security reasons). You will need to use it to go up on the elevator. When you enter your room, make sure the door is closed tight or an alert will sound letting you know). Also, as you enter the room, you will see a slot on the wall, near the door, with a bright blue flashing light. Slide your keycard in the slot, and all of the lights come on. You can adjust them from there.  Here is the other caveat: when you leave the room, and remove he keycard from the slot, after you close the door, all of the power in the room goes out - so if you are charging devices, they will stop charging.",40,745

"I used to be a frequent client of the hotel. During my last stay  I made a mistake when booking the reservation through Expedia as I made it for 6 nights instead of 5 nights. The reservation was placed one day before my arrival since this hotel always has availability due to great competition of other nice brands near it like Hamptons, Fiesta, Ibis etc. Anyway, I stuck to it as customary. Upon check-in I informed the receptionist my mistake and desire to modify my reservation for 1 day less. I was informed that shuold be dealt with Expedia because the are the one that processed the payment. I contacted Expedia and after several attempts they made the hotel refused to reimburse me although the hotel is quite empty.  Regarding quality services: 1- Old towels in the bathroom and",50,745

They don't replace. 4- Some rooms are noisy especially the one next to the elevator and the maid rooms. 5- Poor assistance-oriented hotel, for instance, the don´t have power plug-in adaptors  for European guests.",50,745

We were just told that we will receive one little bottle of purified water PER ROOM, not even per guest.  This is inexcusable. Even the worst of the worst hotels in Mexico provide purified water free of charge to their guests.  We needed a place with a kitchen to provide special meals for my husband and they want us to pay extra for purified water.  This place is the pits.  The worst.  Awful.

We didn’t want to pay a whole lot for another excursion so we decided to venture off & came across this place as it was one of the options the bus staff gives you. It was a $45 round trip per person that included the fare with a tour guide, a stop at some historic ruins and afterwards they take you to a resort with a Mexican style buffet, unlimited (alcoholic drinks) as well as a pool and a beach! Very friendly & attentive staff!! Definitely a steal for what it costs!",50,749

Just made our first cruise trip ever and wasn’t sure where this would end up but I think on a note we were 90% happy! After pricing other cruise excursions we were under the impression unless you buy from the cruise ship you can’t find one. We rode the AutoProgresso bus offered by the city from the port to city and city to port. We were approached by a man with Technotel and told that each person to go on a 45 minute round trip excursion would be $40 per person. Being reluctant and luckily fluent in Spanish I was able to talk the gentleman to let us pay for just the adults and get the Playa added with all inclusive drinks and food for $40. Our taxi was not fluent in English but he was able to communicate with me and me with our friends about the areas we visited. Went back to,40,749
 the resort where the food and drinks were “Amazing” and very generous. I would recommend this. We got to walk in and out of a Mayan Ruin and saw the Cenotes also up close. Progreso is no piece of cake but if you want to shop cheap and eat some good food at least be ready for that. ,50,749

Our fee included unlimited food and drinks plus restroom and shower access, chair and palapa use, and a couple nice pools. Be aware that the beach near the the water is covered with shells and hurts to walk on, but when you get about 20 feet out in to the water, you will find soft sand.

The concept was Thai street food and there were individual stations cooking food in front of us .. reminiscent of eating from a street cart in Bangkok but so much prettier.  I only wish I had captured that for this post.    The food was top quality, capturing the flavors and presentation of authentic Thai food. The fresh rolls, spring rolls, pad Thai, red chicken and potatoe curry, sate, papaya salad and plethora of Thai desserts were all divine.   Chef Gerado who studied in Thailand and cheffed in top",50,755

"This was so disappointing. Do not be fooled by the photographs. Our room was huge and had a small pool. We did not use the pool at all because the water looked dirty. It was still, appeared to have a greasy film on top, and was a most inviting place for mosquitos. The room was painted in dull, grey colours that merged into one another, it was poorly ventilated and lit, and at times the bathroom smelled musty. Surfaces were dusty, and the towels were thin and grey but once upon a time would have been white. On one occasion the bath taps spat like a geyser and discharged foul black water. Despite the significant problem with mosquitos, staff had to be requested on a daily basis to spray the room. The senior staff were pleasant,  but they do not appear to manage the staff well or",20,755

"Unfortunately, our stay was tarnished by heavy building works late at night until early in the morning.   Staff were great especially bellboys.   Rooms are more than spacious and tastefully decorated.   Club sandwich from the room service was very good indeed and Fruit plates were a delicious breakfast - although the moving trucks, yelling workmen and hammering/drilling every morning ruined our breakfasts on the terrace.  You should warn people before they stay about building works. Especially the early start and late evenings.   I spoke to the front desk staff about the noise but they could do nothing. I also wrote to management with no response.  Top end price, top end service from the staff. Let down by poor communication by management.",30,755
"We were booked in here by our travel agents, Ultimate Travel’s ground team in Mexico, Journey Mexico having paid for a luxury bespoke holiday in Mexico.  We arrived at the hotel and were dismayed to find it  in in a rundown suburb of Merida.  Construction works were going on adjacent to the hotel which began at 8.00 am and continued until. 6.00 pm making it impossible for you to hear yourself speak let alone relax by the swimming pools.  The grounds were and swimming pools  were very bland and unappealing and the restaurant noisy and food very average with slow service and waiting staff poorly trained.  We moved hotels the following morning.   ",50,755
"when we checked into this hacienda for 5 nights, we were absolutely thrilled. Very nice suite, well appointed room and spectacular garden. The next morning was a rude awakening. At 8.00 AM the nearby construction work, bulldozers, drilling etc.  started. When we complained at the reception, they simply said nothing, nor offered anything.  We realize the hotel is very annoyed by these construction works, all the rooms suffer from it, but they they could have been apologetic, offered a free cocktail or something. Definitely not up to the service of a  5 star hacienda they pretend to be, and not up to Banyan Tree standards. On the restaurant service, we can be quick, it is very slow, 20 min wait between a margarita order and its delivery, then 35 min wait for the food.  We ordered",50,755
" a few times for delivery to our terrace. They managed to serve us a yoghourt and granola (nothing else on the order) with a fork. Another time our breakfast order was only half delivered. Another time the order was delivered with cutlery but  no plates. The staff is very poorly trained, they have no clue how to serve food or how to deal with customers. Given the lousy service and arrogance of the reception staff in not recognizing the issues mentioned by the customer, I strongly recommend NOT  to stay at this hacienda.  Lastly a very positive comment, a compliment really for Salvador, one of the bellboys. He certainly behaves as if he is well trained to provide a  5 star hotel service . Remembering our name, always greeting us, handing us over fresh towels when we casually told him we were going to Progreso  beach",50,755
"The hotel is located in front of the beach on the malecon.  Our bedroom was on the first floor with blinds that allow people from the street to see inside the room by day from close and to see even more from far by night.  At our arrival they were doing some construction right in front of the hotel.  Even though it is not the hotel’s fault I’m still mentioning it cause waking up early in the morning by the noises of construction workers drilling the ground 10 meters from you bedroom window just doesn’t feel very pleasant nor relaxing when you’re in vacation.  When I gently asked if they had any other rooms available. The girl at the counter whom was already not very friendly since our arrival   At our arrival we were not greeted by her, no smile or salutation, she just waited",20,757

So regarding the customer service and friendlyness could definitely be improved. I didn’t expected another room but being more welcoming and friendly would have been nice.  On the opposite of what the hotel is showing on the website pictures, the room had no balcony and the hotel had no terrace either.   When we ask for where was this terrace we saw on the pictures.  The guy at the reception told us it has been a long time the terrace is not used for that anymore and so now they use it for solar panels. I felt tricked cause on the picture of the hotel they show you a beautiful terrace from where you can admire the sunset but unfortunately there is none.   Also, there’s is 4 wifi in the hotel but you can’t rely on any of them. It works on and off and they told us to deal with it.  After all, the hotel is in good condition, the room was good and comfortable.  But some elements just doesn’t give you the nicest experience for the price you pay.",50,757

"We booked a ""suite"" with a kitchenette.    What is a typical ""kitchenette"" throughout North America?    In my books it is a kitchen facility that includes coffee maker, toaster, pots and pans, silverware, glasses, and dishes.    None of this is provided at Playa Linda.   There was no blanket provided for the bed.  The TV has no english channels, and the front desk only speaks spanish. There is no elevator.  If you are on the fourth floor be prepared to walk up four flights.  There is no person to assist you with your luggage.    There is no safe in our room (although it is advertised).",10,757

Shower ok, but water presure not so good. The shower door did not close well which was a bit anoying. The staff was friendly and we were lucky we could park in front of the entrance. The room was a bit humide after we arrived but soon went away. The view on the top of the hotel is very nice, to the beach and the pier. Lot;s of restaurants and shops around in the hotel area.

If you want to nearly double your price you can get a balcony room or hopefully a window,  but I'm sure the mini multilegged vacuums will be in those rooms too.

We had no hot water issues at all.  I had read all the reviews before coming and had no five star expectations.

Room safe working on a  tubular key system. Close to 24hr OXXO convenience  store where you can get bottled water. Close to HSBC bank which takes most atm and cc cards.

The only bad thing was that our shower had cold water, very cold water.",40,758

All the rooms are centred around the nice courtyard (where breakfast is served) behind the building is a school, we could hear the playground in the mornings but no bother really.  Our room was spacious and clean, and the air con was great. The wifi worked really well most of the time and the water pressure was fine in the shower, with hot water. (Shampoo & soap provided) There didn't seem to be many guests staying but that could be just because of the time of year, we pretty much had the place to ourselves!

Nice people but the dopiest lot I have ever seen. Nobody speaks English, that's OK, I speak Spanish, not the problem. Go to room at 3pm, no towels, call them and we get some pool towels. The rooms are very spacious, that bit is good. Next morning, brekkies included, come down to a small table of offerings that would make a poor 'Motel 6' operation blush.

This restaurant has been completely renovated since we first went ten years ago. I notice someone who was there in 2012 did not like but I think they would find it very different now. We have been for both lunch and breakfast several times and everything we have had has been good. They also do a carry out meal for supper which you order in advance. The pool is sparkling clean as is the eating area. They now have a separate children's pool. I can't comment on the accommodation but it looks clean and tidy looking through the windows. The prices are very reasonable and the staff helpful and friendly I am reviewing the restaurant here as have never stayed since we live in Chelem,50,760
"Four of us went to Hotel Las Garzas for lunch. The menu looked good, but we had been talking about hamburgers so we decided to go American and had the hamburgers(with a Mexican flair). First came the botanas; a delicious chicken fajita for each. We had made the ""mistake""of ordering chicken nachos(very good); mistake because it was huge. After the fajita and nachos (para llavar because we couldn't finish the nachos) came the hamburger and french fries (more para llavar because we couldn't finish that either). All of the food was well prepared and very good. The service was fast and friendly. We all highly recommend this restaurant; we will most definitely go back during our next trip to Chelem.",40,760
"we stayed for  2 nights in august 2012, this hotel sucks,  price is cheap, but so are  the rooms, the lights went out everyday, the fan, the lamps and even the door was falling at pieces, dark rooms, stinky bathroom, and old beds and mattresses, avoid !!",10,760
"We stayed here for the 1 night we stayed in Chelem. I think as there are not too many hotels in Chelem, this would probably be a good choice. It was pleasant as it has a nice, clean pool, chairs to sunbathe, a pool table and even tennis courts. There were a couple things that were off-putting, like the toilet did not flush properly. Also, when we decided to not stay a 2nd night (we had reserved two nights and then changed our plans), the person at the front desk made a fuss over it. It was definitely understandable that he be a bit upset, as we did change our plans at the last minute. In the end though, everything was sorted out and we enjoyed our time there. I would definitely recommend this hotel for families, as it's close to the beach and the plaza, but if people don't want",30,760

"Spent 2 nights here in Feb. 2011.  The staff were very friendly and helpful to us, especially Alex and Raul. (We really enjoyed our stay here, but I feel I have to give it only 3 stars, in order to keep expectations realistic for typical American tourists.  This is not the Ritz, it is a beachside place in a small town, so you will see things like old bathroom fixtures, beat-up furniture, etc.  If these things don't matter to you, then you'll enjoy this place.) Our room was large and comfortable, with a big balcony.  They have a nice cool pool, big enough for a real swim; rooftop patio with sweeping views; wireless internet; and good location: 1/2 block from the beach, and about a 4 or 5 minute walk to the main square.  There are several places to eat and little markets around",30,760

We will definitely be back!",50,761
This was our third February in a row at the Flamingos Inn. Mike continues to make improvements. The beach is much better...more sand has been deposited. Breakfasts were awesome. We stayed in the Arena Room on the second floor. It’s our favorite room.,50,761

Love the beach walks there. It was a bit windy for ocean swimming this time, but the pool was lovely. Mike is a gracious host and is very helpful with recommendations. He added solar power to the inn, which we really appreciate. It’s a luxurious stay with a reduced carbon footprint.",50,761
From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed like family. Rozie met us at the gate and gave me a big hug. Im like “really”??? I thought I was the only one who hugs strangers. From that moment on we were part of the Flamingos family. We stayed in the Arena room which was in a perfect location for the ocean views and courtyard views. Rozie makes a fantastic breakfast and our favorite was the biscuits and gravy. We actually asked her to size our portions down the second day because we got so full that we didn’t have any room to try any of the roadside local food for lunch. Lol..... Mike and my husband are planning to go diving the next time we stay with them. We never felt unsafe driving to and from the INN or anywhere in the Chuburna/Chelem area for that matter.

"Flamingos Inn is one of the most comfortable friendly hotels I have ever stayed in.  Don't expect the amenities of a big fancy resort, this is so much more.  Flamingos Inn is about friendliness, relaxation and a sense of belonging, from the moment I walked onto the property and met Roze, I felt welcome and the personalized service just made me feel more like I was at home.  My wife arrived a few days after me and she felt the same thing.  We stayed a total of two weeks and do not hesitate to call Roze and Mike our friends, If you are looking for a relaxing vacation with no worries, this is the place to stay.  Absolutely nothing bad to say about the facility or the hosts, absolute heaven.",50,761
"The new owners, Mike and Roze, have made many improvements to what was a great place to begin with. First of all, the parking area has been rock-lined to delineate parking spots. Next, the walkway from the gate has been beautifully paved so luggage can be easily rolled. My wife and I stayed in the Arena room on this visit. It had a new, full-sized fridge so we did not need a separate cooler for ice and drinks like last year. Roze’s breakfasts were outstanding. Finally, Mike and Roze are very friendly and perfect hosts. We can’t wait to come back next year.",50,761

They had private areas for guests only which made it awesome to be comfortable relaxing when taking in the scenery.    Only downsides I had was that the lighting was way too dim ... and no ventilation in the bathroom.   However, I would definitely recommend staying there again if you want a romantic stay on a gorgeous island.",50,762

Convenient walk to everywhere including lots of restaurants.  The front desk recommended restaurants that were fantastic!   Staff were wonderful to work with.  Breakfast at their beach café was always good. Jorge, our bartender took really good care of us.",50,762
"Casa Jaguar is a beautiful small hotel located close to North Beach. We enjoyed our stay here, glad we chose this location, as it was close to everything. Not having to worry about transportation was a big deal! We were walking distance from the ferry, few steps from the beach, a block from a great selection of restaurants.  More positives -breakfast included at the Green Zebra beach club next door -never have to fight for a beach chair, they are reserved for the hotel -there was a hammock in our room! with a nice view (not really ocean view but still a good view) -the beds are comfy, and the shower pressure is great! Some negatives -the entrance to the beach from the hotel gets locked at 8pm (not sure what time in the morning it opens, we slept in). This was very inconvenient",40,762
" when we just wanted to walk on the beach at night. We had to walk all around the hotel and down the side street.  -there is no gym. There is a yoga studio at Na Balam next door, but it is not owned by them, so you have to pay to attend classes there ($15 was pretty steep). They would not let me borrow a yoga mat to use in my room. This is a bummer for a fancy hotel not to have a gym or any gym equipment. -the pool you are allowed to use is at Na Balam. It is a small sad pool. We wanted to use the jacuzzi (next to the pool) at night, but they turn off the lights and the heat at 8pm. We never came back to Na Balam, it just looked sad. -they charge you for coffee pods in your room, $4. Seriously? This is a fancy hotel, and they are nickel and diming you for every little thing. Oh, the bottled water in the fridge is also not free.  -The entire design of the bathroom and sinks are weird. There is no ventilation in the bathroom, so nothing ever gets dry. The sink basically just splashes water back at you when you turn it on. Idk who designed this beautiful dysfunctional thing.  So, in conclusion, most of the negatives are 1% problems. However, this hotel is geared towards people who can afford it, right? So they have to pay more attention to those little annoying things that would be easy and cheap to fix. They are building more stuff around, making everything more beautiful. However, I can see them losing their clientele if they continue with charging for minor things that should be free. Hopefully, one of the things they are building next door is a gym :)",50,762

L'accès à la plage direct est top, pas bruyant pour autant, matelas réservés pour la clientèle de l'hôtel sur la plus belle plage de l'île; le seul point à améliorer serait le petit déjeuner qui se prend au restaurant à côté, pas aussi classe que l'hôtel, un peu frugal !",50,762
We had a great stay at this nice hotel. The rooms are really big. We are a family of 5 and it would have been so much better if the possibility of sleeping 3 in a room excisted. There is a sofa in the rooms that could easily be a bed. Business development!,50,762
So glad we came across this hotel.  Very good location right on the beach ( You can use sun beds there)  Staff were very helpful and rooms immaculately cleaned .  A continental breakfast was taken next door and was a good choice - unlimited coffee/ tea would have been good.  You also have to pay for coffee pods in your room.,50,762
"We have visited Isla Mujeres many times over many years and Chichi Charlie’s was always one of our main stops.! We are 60  and like to make a day of our beach hike stopping for drinks and conversation along the way. We start at the tip of North Beach stopping to swim, eat, drink and walk. We always tend to spend the most time at Chi-chi Charlie’s. Great views of the ocean and a fun place to stop. Well at least it used to be. Today when we arrived we picked one of the many open tables where we could people watch and have a few drinks and maybe an appetizer or two. Instead of our normal greeting of, “hola what can I get you” The first question was are you staying upstairs in our rooms. When we replied no we were told there’s a 400 peso minimum and not in a friendly way. Although",10,763

The manager told me he would bring towels to the room and never did. Ended up with one dirty beach towel to use for two showers. Not enough electric outlets in the room and only one light. Shower was only a trickle. The ""new"" section is in a separate but connected hotel. Far below a 3 star property",20,763
"We stayed at ChiChi’s ‘n Charlies for four nights over Easter Weekend. The hotel was perfect for what we needed it for. We needed a homebase on the beach at a reasonable price - we paid $60+/night.  We didn’t spend much time in the room other than to shower at the end of a day on the beach and to sleep. The room was simple and CLEAN. It even had a refrigerator which we weren’t expecting but very thankful for. It was cleaned everyday. While my wife was getting ready I loved having a beer on the balcony right over the beach. You are right on the beach and adjacent to all the beach clubs and nearby restaurants. The location is about as good as you can get for the price and the view. Unfortunately, we did not spend much time at the main hotel bar or eat at the restaurant - there was",50,763
" too much to do and see! We did however have a few drinks at sunset at the secondary beach bar on their property (there are two beach bars on the property). It was a great time every time we stopped there to have a drink - very friendly bartenders.   Suggestions - The balcony could use a plastic chair or two to relax outside of the room. However, I am sure they would have accommodated this had I asked.  Con’s - The only issue I had was the water pressure in the shower. It was a 2 out of 10. But hey, maybe that was just our room (#15). Wifi was also not the greatest. It worked, but if we wanted to facetime our kids we had to go to somewhere with more capable wifi. It worked fine for google maps and text based applications however.   Advice - If you are getting a basic room, ask for a room on the 3rd level. I believe the rooms on our level were 14, 15, 16, & 17. Rooms on the ground level and second level may be blocked by the main bar/reception area. Also, do not confuse this property with Cuxos! Cuxos is the newer hotel on the same property! In reading some of previous reviews of ChiChi’s n Charlies, some are mistaking the two!   For the price, I would recommend this hotel and I would stay here again. It is not fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but if a simple hotel just to sleep is all you need, Chichi’s is for you; it is the perfect combination of price and location!",50,763

If you're looking for good internet, good customer service etc... do not stay here. If you watch TV at all while on vacation,  my room had a smart TV but internet did not work at all so wasn't able to use netflix etc.. or a firestick if you bring yours.

When I complained I was told that it was the owner's fauld because he didn't alert the personnel about the construction start date (?). I was offered A) a stinky room with funghus on the wall that they only use for emergency (?) B) A room right below the constructions works C) full refund and up to me to find another room in an overbooked Island (D smaller room in a different building without terrace upon payment of additional 40USD. Also this last room was very noisy, probably because there is a water pump or something noisy all day and night on. When insisting with the manager that this was no service and I wanted an explanation for them",10,764
" ignoring my main request, he just kept on saying that this was the owner's fault because he didn't tell the personnel in time about the construction. THIS RUINED OUR HOLIDAYS. I regularly visit Isla Mujeres and this hotel is the worst ever I stayed, even a hostel provides more comfort and service.",40,764

"We stayed here 5 nights during our 7 night trip.  Check in was a little rough, they could not find our reservation, which I pulled up on my phone and showed the gentleman.  They had us full out a new reservation sheet and we had a,room in no time.  Our room was clean and spacious, had a balcony over looking the back of the bar.  There was no hot water upon check in, and since we just came from another hotel with no hot water I was slightly concerned.  I inquired about it and they said it was being fixed, and sure enough by evening we had not,and I mean hot showers.  They do have beach towels availble, it requires a deposit of either your room key or $10 cash per towel.  We did the cash and just switched out our towels as needed, cash was returned to us when we brought the towels",40,764
" back at check out.  Romy was amazing, he has the bar by the pool and makes wonderful drinks.  He was so much fun.  Tje pool was a little chilly, but clean.  The location is great, easy walk to every thing.  There is free coffee each morning from 5:30 to 7:30 at the front check in area, it is not great but it was hot.  All in all we were very satisfied with our stay.",30,764

"Really run down hotel.  Even the ""newer"" buildings, are run down with a tired mattress, hard as a rock.  Tried to get a manager to respond to a air conditioner what worked yet didn't cool the room.  Nope.  Manager was not available by phone or in person.  Pool looked dirty and not what the pictures represent.  Overall a terrible stay.  This place is run down, uncomfortable and some of the worst service I've encountered in Mexico.    Realmente descuidado hotel. Incluso los edificios ""más nuevos"" están deteriorados por un colchón cansado, duro como una piedra. Intenté que un gerente respondiera a un aire acondicionado que funcionaba pero no enfriaba la habitación. No. El gerente no estaba disponible por teléfono ni en persona. La piscina se veía sucia y no lo que representan las",20,764
" imágenes. En general, una estancia terrible. Este lugar está deteriorado, es incómodo y es uno de los peores servicios que he encontrado en México.  Go elsewhere, there are many more hotels in Isla.  Ignacio the manager/owner doesn't care about his business and his employees show it.  ",40,764
"After a 2 year hiatus we went last minutes while Omicron was beginning to slow down.  Close to the beach, restaurants close by.  Beach access was lovely - but there is no free beach club access.  There are lots of beach clubs close by though.    Hotel felt a little neglected on arrival, but it was clear they were putting lots of effort into grounds cleanup etc during our second week.  Beds are small, but we managed.  Water pressure and hot water were good.  Loved our balcony.  Desk kindly ensured we had side by side rooms which was nice too.",40,765
"This was our second visit to Maria Del Mar, and our third to Isla Mujeres. Unfortunately since our first visit in 2016 the hotel appears to have gone down hill and so too does the island. Below I will list the positives and negatives we encountered during our stay.  Positives: - The hotel is ideally located with direct access to the Playa Norte beach. - Friendly staff - Offers reliable golf buggy hire at a cheap price - Private pool for hotel guests along with hammocks to relax on during the day and in the evening.  Negatives: - Breakfast was one of the main positive memory’s I had from our first visit, unfortunately this is no longer the case. Breakfast is served over the road at Buhos which it also was back in 2016, the difference now being that you are only served a slice of",20,765
" toast with a juice and hot drink and no longer have the option to purchase additional items for breakfast such as eggs, bagels or any other cooked breakfast items. This really let the place down as a slice of toast for breakfast isn’t filling for anyone and left us with no other choice but to eat elsewhere. - The WiFi is non existent in the rooms, it only works around the pool. - The room was filthy, possibly one of the filthiest rooms I’ve stayed, the beds were stained, everything was covered in dust and it just felt like there was no effort whatsoever from housekeeping. It’s not acceptable during normal times but it is especially not acceptable during Covid. - The hardest thing for us during our stay was seeing how the island has gone down hill since our first 2 visits, the beaches are over crowded, the restaurants as a result of demand have increased their prices and it generally feels like the Island is struggling to cope with the huge amount of visitors it receives both during the day and in the evening. The roads are over crowded with golf buggies, cars, trucks and motorbikes, the beaches are packed with tourists, the sea feels dangerous to swim around Playa Norte due to the ridiculous amount of private boats anchored just off the beach, non seem to care when manoeuvring about swimmers and all of them seem to compete with each other over who can play the loudest music which has taken away the feel of paradise that was experienced on our 2 previous visits.   It such a shame that the hotel as well as the island have deteriorated, I had hoped to continue our holidays to Isla Mujeres and Maria Del Mar for many years into the future but I now feel like I’m unlikely to visit again after our recent experience.",20,765

"I understand this is a budget, older property. However, certain things I expect even from budget properties is cleanliness and a at least a little maintenance. This hotel is in a great location and has a distinctive old world charm that could really be made into something special with a little elbow grease.  First of all, cleanliness was an issue. The ceiling in our room was covered in cobwebs that when the ceiling fan was turned on would blow around the room. Stains on the bedding, even a blood stain on the lanyard for our room key.  Maintenance wise, we could see daylight around the window A/C unti in our wall and this let mosquitoes into our room.   We brought up all issues to the front desk and they were a little apathetic, they were understanding but said there was nothing",40,765
" they could do about it.  The pool water was never clear, so opted out of jumping in.  On the bright side, the location is perfect and once again the charm of this place could really be capitalized on with a little work!  We rented a golf cart from the hotel and their rental rates were reasonable.  Also their restaurant, Buho's was a great little beach bar with pretty good, although very basic food.",20,765

Upon arrival walking 15 minutes from ferry with luggage on busy walkways at 4pm ($4.00 5 minute taxi ride) at check in a security deposit of $150.00 is mandatory (one surmises that a lot of young party folk book here and do damage?) . Excellent.,10,765
"I booked this for my son and I.  I chose this hotel based on price and location.  I read the reviews a week before our arrival and was a little concerned.  Checking in was easy and we were shown the property and the room.  And my concerns quickly went away.  The room, bathroom, and balcony were clean.  Daily maid service and a in room Covid test.  We did not eat the breakfast due to dive trips, but toast and coffee I would exactly call breakfast.  We will be back.",50,765
"So we ended up booking a last minute deal and our hotel (beautiful next door property) did not have one night so logically we thought about booking as close as possible and ended up at Maria del Mar. The positives: Beautiful beach just as the rest of the resorts, property garden is really nice. Cons: Extremely old, moldy, no wifi (the pool area got crowed just because of the wifi signal). Beds mega mega old. Bathroom old. Our bedding looked clean but room was dusty. AC was bad too. Just very old property with zero interest to upgrade I guess.    We were checking out very early to catch ferry and flight. The person told me well we are not here until 8am so leave the key and bracelets inside the room. I made sure I called to let them know later that morning. It is been two weeks",10,765
"We are still here enjoying our 12 day stay at this wonderful hotel! The owners and staff are absolutely wonderful and the place is amazing. This is our second time here and we’re coming back in February. It is a wonderful location, about a 20 minute walk to Centro. Highly recommend.",50,766
This hotel was amazing! We just checked out from our 5 night stay and we did not want to leave. All staff were very helpful. The place was so beautiful. They hung a sign for my daughters birthday in our room for when we arrived. They made her a birthday cake out of towels. The girls at the front desk were nice & helpful. Kevin the waiter made good drinks & was very friendly. We ate breakfast 2 times and it was great I was worried that the room was going to be small but it was not. We had the room with the outdoor kitchen. To our surprise there was an extra added on setting area off of the patio. I would recommend this hotel to everyone! (Sorry I didn’t get pics of room before hand),50,766
"Our recent stay met our expectations in most ways.  Bahia Tolok is located within walking distance to the more lively part of the island.  If you opt to take a taxi, it will cost approx 100 mxn pesos.  The staff was helpful to arrange a golf cart rental for us.  Otherwise, the staff provided very little contact other than adequate housekeeping.  Our room was clean, cool and had comfortable beds.  The hot water was minimal and in-room WiFi was very spotty.  Not a deal breaker for us.  The grounds were very well kept and were seemingly tended to in part by the family (?) that might live on the premises.  During one night there was a very loud party on the grounds that lasted until 2:30-3 am.  Some construction noise during the day and late afternoon coupled with the party noise",40,766
" was a bit off putting, but it happens.  Definitely is situated in a quiet part of the island.",50,766
…,50,766
"We were on the island for 17 days and spent the first 4 nights here. This was a great place to begin as the staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and comfortable and had an outdoor kitchen and large patio with a hammock. There is also a room directly on the pool which I'd like to try as well! The included continental breakfast was surprisingly satisfyingly and all you need to start your day. You can walk to Playa Norte in less than 30 minutes, which we would have done often had it not been for the humidity, but the front desk will call a cab for you and it's only around $5 to get anywhere. I highly recommend this hotel and hope to return soon. My only regret is not enjoying the pool or the small beach while were were there.",50,766
"Excellent - we arrived without reservation, reception showed us two rooms and we went with Room 8. A king size bed and fridge after two days we decided to extend our stay so we moved to Room 1 which had a small kitchen that made it easier for our baby in a morning.  Overall, the reception, cleaning and bar staff have all been great !!!   We are now thinking of returning for a month later in the year",10,766
I spent quite some time here and fell in love with the place. Perfectly situated about a 30 minute walk to Norte beach and about the same going south to the main grocery store v you definitely don't need a golf cart to stay here. My room was #7 and the cleaning of it was impeccable.  The staff was so friendly and management was always there.  No issue with language differences.  I had some personal issues trying to get a friend there from the US and our plans changed 3 different times that would require a larger room.  The staff worked with me every time there was a change. They went way beyond anything I expected.  I will return here again very soon and would highly recommend Bahia Toluk to any traveler going to Isla Mujeres.,50,766
"I came to Isla Mujeras to relax, but that is the last thing that will happen here.  There is loud construction right below my room and the manager is not here so that I can cancel the rest of my stay.  Of course this booking is none-refundable (at $130 a night) according to the front desk associate.  The WiFi does not work and there is very little hot water for a shower.  What a terrible experience.  The view is fantastic, but I would highly recommend that you think twice before staying here.",50,766
"We had an amazing 12 day stay in January to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had a great room with a comfortable bed, King size, full kitchen with everything you need to prepare food & a generous bathroom with a walk in shower. They do a continental breakfast that they will set up wherever you want it, it's basic but it's nice to start the day. The have a very nice pool & a small beach. It's not Playa Norte but it's still right on the water.   The staff are so kind & helpful. They really make the stay extra enjoyable, so much so, we're coming back for another 12 day stay in November. We can't wait!!  It's about a twenty minute walk to Centro but we love to walk, it was perfect for us.  There are some very good restaurants close by as well.  Sunset Grill is excellent & the",50,766
"Rooms are basic but OK given the price. Bed, aircon and shower were fine. Location is great, close to things but silent, a unique combination that I didn’t find anywhere else on this island.  Staff is quite uninterested and rude, so if that is a big factor for you I recommend going elsewhere.",30,767
"We stayed here in February in the Beach House with another couple. You have your own building with a patio and raised terrace for watching the sunrise. The beach house looks remodeled and it was very nice for each bedroom to have their own bathroom. We didn't have any hot water the first day but notified the staff and they promptly fixed it. It was nice to have a kitchen to have a snack or heat up leftovers and with the Super Akai a block away we stocked the fridge with beer and water. The pool is in disrepair and some of the lighting could use a facelift. But, being right on the Malecon steps away from the Carribbean Sea, you can't beat the location. And the Tiny Gecko is 300 feet away for drinks. I would definitely stay here again.",40,767
Spacious rooms and friendly staff.  The housekeepers went above and beyond to make the stay great.  And you simply can't beat the view!!  The attached pic is from our balcony (that's the railing at the bottom of the pic).  We come to Isla every year and we would certainly stay here again.,50,767
"The location, view and really cute rooms got it a 3 star but I’ve seen a lot of recommendations on TripAdvisor telling solo female travelers to come here and I definitely wouldn’t recommend it for those. I simply didn’t feel safe during my stay.   As I’m a solo female traveler myself,  I always request a higher floor when I travel. This hotel in particular made you pay extra for non ground floor rooms. Perfect, right? Wrong! To my dismay, I was placed in a room that I would absolutely consider ground floor. The staff however said the “basement” rooms are what’s considered ground floor and wouldn’t switch my room to a higher one. As I feared, passer bys could see my room from the sidewalk. Anyone could easily climb that balcony.  Safety is a big priority for me so I cut my stay",30,767

Many restaurants around and gricery store. Street food available next to the church. We will be back one day.",50,767
"Amazing Hotel for the price!! We stayed here for 4 nights last week.  It was only $56 per night and was more than worth it.  The room was very clean, water pressure was very good, bed was comfortable and had the most amazing sunrises!!! Pool was very nice too.  The property is about a 5 min walk to the beach, grocery store and numerous restaurants.   About a 10 to 15 min walk to Playa Norte.  Also, on 2 or 3 blocks from the Ferry Terminal...straight wall right from the Ferry entrance. ",40,767
"What I mean by the title of this review is on first appearance the room looks a little old and/or run down but the hotel really grew on my girlfriend and I. So it could use some room darkening curtains and the shower could have a lot better water pressure but once you get over the small things you realize what a bargain this hotel really is. You have a million dollar view, it is about 3 blocks walking a straight shot right off the ferry, you are about a block from the main entertainment/food area Hidalgo street. In our opinion all that makes it 5 stars! Oh there’s a very nice kitty on the grounds as well that we fed during our stay.",50,767
"Great view, and easy walk to downtown/ferry.  We rented a golf cart, and they had a nice gated area to park it overnight.  Pool was too cold in December, but the view was outstanding.  We went to beach club on North Beach during the day to enjoy the beautiful water.",40,767
We loved this hotel.  Wish they had coffee on site.  Such a simple addition.  We loved the beach in front of the hotel.  We rented chairs and umbrella from isla rentals on fb. They delivered and picked up at the front desk. Room was fine. Would def return!,40,768
"We stayed 27th- 29th April, a family of 2 adults 4 kids over 2 rooms. We were given ground floor room 9 and 10.   We thought this hotel, B & b was really cute, the kitchen, and reading room needs an update or a good clean at least, but rooms were clean, with clean beds and fresh towels, toiletries and toilet roll. Air con worked. A fridge was provided. Obviously there was no luxury to the place but the gardens were very neat and tidy, pool was perfect my kids loved it, setting and location was perfect for us, shame they couldn't open the gates to the beach during the day but no major issue.  We loved the dim lights and hammocks and rocking chairs, such a chill vibe, we much preferred this to mainland all Inc hotel, a kettle in the room would also be a bonus. Absolutely we would",40,768
" come back.   Ladies on reception were polite and helpful, toast and coffee, juice were provided down the street for bfast, again something to put you on but if they could add a plate of fruit to that it would be great. Short stroll to restaurants and main street. In our opinion we would much rather stay here than a more expensive hotel for the chill vibe, met some nice people too as its a nice intimate place.   Bit of problem for us was most of the island doesn't take card payments, I knew this beforehand but the cash machines weren't giving us money everyday so we ended up running out of money, bit of a problem with tipping as in we couldn't leave what we wanted and we had to really budget which didn't feel nice, but something people should be aware of, have plenty of money and small notes for tips, be aware some places add on very big tips so check your bills.",10,768

Got here at 3 with my sons (13&10).  Son went to pee and flushed the toilet. Toilet clogged. We went out to eat and got back at 6. My 10 yrs old needed to go number two. Toilet still clogged and we went to the office to use their toilet. I explained to the two ladies at receptionist that the toilet is clogged and my son needs to use the toilet now. She said I have to go to my room. Again I said the toilet is clogged. I explained to her since we got here at 3. She said this time you can use the toilet but we’re going to send someone to check it. If there’s toilet paper in there we will charge you. Wow!! So much for courtesy and being helpful to their customers! I’m very disappointed. This is our first time staying here. The approach was not what I expected. So I give this place,40,768
" zero star but it’s not an opting apparently. Room wise, small but okay. It has pool and patio. It’s good for two people or one adult and two young children. Location is perfect right in front of Mia reef. Would I stay here again, no. Simply because if I want to spend money, I expect at least a courtesy. I’m going to wait if they’re going to charge me or not and I’ll do my other review.  Btw, there’s no sign not to put toilet paper on the toilet and they didn’t mention anything about it either when checkin in. Not happy customer especially if they charge me for it. Wow!!",20,768

We initially booked our stay for July 2020 but due to COVID 19 travel cancellations we were unable to take this planned vacation. I contacted the hotel several times to discuss options on refund or credit for the  1st day on 2 rooms. They would not give ant type of refund or credit.  In August 2021 me and my Fiancé we for a 3 day stay at the hotel because we were drawn by the pictures and location. There were a few bad incidents that sealed our decision to never stay there again. We both fell on wet slippery floors in the room because they would mop versus just sweeping which would leave the floor wet the whole day due to the high humidity. We have already told both the front desk and cleaning person and they did not follow our request of not mopping room. My fiancé ended up,10,768

"Hotel is in a nice location for access to north beach, bars, and restaurants. Located right on Hidalgo. The rooms are clean, and cleaned daily. The pool area was also clean. The hotel is in desperate need of updating and maintenance. A fresh coat of paint would go a long way in starting to help to update the hotel. Our bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. Our refrigerator was also very noisy. Air conditioner appeared fairly new and worked great. We had a room on the second floor facing the pool. Yes, we could hear some loud music late into the night, but it didn’t keep us up. I believe it would be a different situation if you were on the street side, I think that would be very loud.",30,769

We did not find the front desk employees friendly which is unusual since we have been visiting ISLA for 10 years.  There is no privacy when sitting on the patio, lounge chairs around the pool are in the grass where you get bug bites.  Pool is clean but the area around it needs a good cleaning including the walking area in front of all the rooms.  The rooms are clean but need a lot of maintenance.  Normally everywhere I have traveled in the world they offer a couple English Channels or you can change the language not so here.  One English Channel and it was something stupid we would not",20,769

It's on Hidalgo, the main pedestrian street which is full of restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. It can get noisy at night but my room faced the courtyard and I didn't hear a thing. It's only a few blocks from the beach. I liked it, I'll stay there again.",30,769

In addition to our beautiful view, we are also the only room in the hotel without a balcony or patio, and we suffered through 2 days without any hot water before they fixed the problem. The wi-fi has not worked since we got here 4 days ago. And neither has our television.   For $100 a night, we . expected more.

A coffee maker (bring/buy coffee) some limited kitchen supplies, and a back clothesline to hang all our wet things we’re all convenient pluses. The reception was very nice.

We were upgraded to no.11 which was a perfect room, good size and with all necessary amenities.  Everything you will need is either within the premises or just outside, including some of the best places for breakkfast, lunch and dinner.  Those who want healthy superfood will only have to go a few meters. Alex is fluently in english and can assist in most matters. Highly reccomondable !",30,770
Unique and quiet. Rooms are clean and large. Bring your own coffee for the coffee maker provided. On site message is a must! Friendly helpful staff. No In room safe so had to carry passport and money with at all times.  Walking distance to beach and many eateries.,50,770
"This property  is situated three minutes walk from the beach and this is it's main advantage. Since we were a group of 14, it was also important that it has nice recreation areas to congregate as a group on the premises. Manager Alex is very accommodating, rooms are well cleaned every day. However the property itself  is pretty run down. Jacuzzi full of water but dirty and not working. During our week stay there were periods of time up to several hours there were no electricity (air-conditioning, fridge), there was a day with no water (pipes burst, it was explained). Noone is on reception during the night, and once we locked ourselves out in the evening and had to rely on texting manager and waiting for our text to be discovered (what if it was not?) And for manager to arrive",50,770
" back on the property to open the door for us.  Kitchenette in each room is pathetic, it has one electric burner that only accommodates local pots and pans which are so worn out and burned that it was virtually impossible to cook there. I bought a new pan in local supermarket and discovered it won't work on this type of burner. Utensils and plates are hard to come across, had to scramble from room to room to find something that would be sufficient to feed a family.  One of the worst features is that air-conditioning units are located on the wall right above the bed, so it is impossible to have it on during night and not getting cold.  Each room has inner court to dry clothes on a rope. Five people from our group on different occasions locked themselves out of the rooms without a chance to come back as it locks behind you. They had to scream for help , bang on doors trying to get out of this enclosure. Bottom line: if you want to be in and out and use this place to spend a night, and the air conditioner blasting into your ear is not a problem for you, do it. For more quality time especially if with the family, this property is far from ideal.",40,770

Hotel is very basic but it’s clean and in a great location. There are many stairs so if you are one that cannot do stairs this is not the place for you. The owners are very nice. The wifi is only available in the lobby area and out back. It did not reach the bedrooms. I can’t say anything bad about the hotel the only issue we encountered is that one day coming back from the beach we were needing to shower for dinner and there was no water. They said it was getting maintenance on it. We were allowed to shower in the bathroom in he lobby with cold water. That was a little annoying since you pay for amenities.   The hotel Is great for the price (as long as you have water your whole stay) and in the middle of everything. A few minutes to North beach and right on Hidalgo. Evenings,30,771

"Great place for the price. Perfect location on Hidalgo street. Cold A/C, hot shower, comfy beds. Had a great working small fridge. Room is small but perfect. Did not give 5 stars because room was on top floor and stairs were steep. Will return.",50,771
"I returned to the Bucaneros Hotel and Suites because I had such a wonderful experience and have referred friends to stay, as it is steps away from everything fun! Unfortunately, the quality and maintenance of the hotel has gone downhill and its not due to the wonderful ladies that clean the rooms. We reserved our room online prior to arriving, they had no reservation upon arriving, put us in room 102, which we were told was a balcony room, NO it was a small window that you had to crawl thru that if shut would lock you out on the two chair balcony overlooking Rolandi's restaurant & Bar. The refrigerator was broken and after a full afternoon of waiting for maintenance to swap it out, they decided to move us to the room next door that had a working fridge and a broken TV. Both",50,771
" rooms needed the scared up walls painted, the towels were stained and the bathroom walls and doors were stained with things that I probably don't want to know. The noise from the daily garbage trucks, yelling employees trying to get scooters and tables moved for the garbage to be picked up was ridiculous. The pictures reflected on this site DO NOT REPRESENT WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTING.  The price is low but so are the standards in which you will be staying, the change over of people is daily, as I think people stay one night and move on. As for COVID testing, just walk down to the beach and there is a COVID trailer there $30.00 USD, results in 45 minutes, DONE, no Dr. visit needed and the staff knew nothing of the test site, so I'm not sure who the lady in April was referring?",50,771

This was an extremely clean nice hotel on the Main Street in Isla Mujeres. It is family run and they are very helpful. I have no complaints on anything. I’m just sorry I haven’t written it before now. Very reasonable prices also. We had a balcony room overlooking the Main Street.,40,771
"The staff at Hotel Bucanaros hotel and suites went above and beyond to help us with Covid testing for our return to the US. They made all arrangements for the Doctor to come to the hotel for the swabs, opened a private area for testing and collected the results for us. It was so easy. The staff here are the best.",40,771
"We didn't know what to expect at Na Balam but were pleasantly surprised. Rooms were very clean and basic but more than enough for what we needed. Pool area is nice though very shady and reminded us of Bali. Our 5 yr old loved the pool. The hotel is very quiet with only 12 or so rooms so is a little oasis. The daily yoga classes (small cost) were great and Lal was an amazing instructor, especially to our 5 year old! Only downside was how busy the beach was. We were there just before Easter and Playa Norte was crazy, very difficult to relax and not how I remembered Isla from 10 years before! May have been time of year, may just be how it is these days. Not the hotel's fault at all though. Business was the same throughout the north end of the island.",50,772
The rooms are set amongst leafy grounds which inspire peace and rest.  It’s in a great location very near the beach and the Main Street for restaurants and bars.  Staff were friendly and rooms were well cleaned.  The pool is a good size and yoga classes are run but an excellent guy called Lal.,50,772
"We came here for a friend’s birthday. They stayed  at a more expensive hotel that was all booked up, so we were just “accidentally” at Na Balam.  What a glorious accident!  Management communicated with us before check-in, which was simple and flawless.  We were provided bottled water in an artistic carafe, freshened up daily.  Room was clean and simple.  I read a review earlier about the room smelling good, and it’s true!!  I got home, and all my clothes still smelled like the room.  Amazing!  The pool is tranquil and the perfect size.  Of course, the beach...calm Playa Norte is the most picturesque ever!  If you want more of a party vibe, walk a couple of steps across the street to The Lotus and enjoy their beach club too.  We’re going back in June.  Can’t wait to stay at Na",50,772

I am staying right now at this property. I am on the “other side of the road” and it seems like the beach side is being renovated. For $100 a night with tax we have a nice size room with a nice size bathroom. It overlooks a cozy jungle like courtyard and small pool. The clerk at the check in is super nice. The room is clean and the bedding smells nice LOL. The best part about this property is the location. You can walk out on the street and turn right and be right at the calm section of north beach where my kid is in heaven. This area is mostly families and I love the calm shallow clear water. If you cut across the street it puts you out by the green demon beach club and more on north beach proper. Either way it is just a few steps really to my favorite beach anyplace.,50,772
"I want to give a shout out to this hotel for their customer service during the COVID pandemic! I booked through a third party under a no change /no cancellation booking. My travel date needed to be changed so I decided to try with no real expectation. Well, I am thrilled to report that they let me change my date! Im so impressed with their generosity and superb customer service! Thank you Na Balam! I absolutely  love this hotel. The grounds are so beautiful, the beach is amazing and the customer service top notch! I cant wait to come back!",10,772
"I spent a long time looking for a hotel:   In Playa Norte With A/C  Small(not a resort) On the Beach With restaurant on site   In spite of some of the negative reviews, took a chance on this hotel and it paid off; it was wonderful. Just as it looks on the pictures.  We stayed in a deluxe room with a king bed on a second floor with a partial view of the beach: gorgeous!   I wasn’t counting on a TV and mini fridge in the room. Nice surprise!  WiFi is slows but works in the room, restaurant and even at the beach; just be patience.  An umbrella, table and two-person bed beach are available at no extra fee; a cabana is available at a discounted fee if you are a hotel guest.   The hotel is near a bar and a resort and it can get loud at night. Not a problem for us since we got all our",30,772

"It was amazing!!! Paradise totally!! Everything is incredible, specially the views. We stayed at one of the bungalows and it was magical! We absolutely loved it. The food was pretty good too. The only reason it is not getting all 5 stars is because there is no AC in the room. I understand that they may do it because it is not eco-friendly but it is needed. We were sweating because the room was like an oven at night. Regardless it was awesome and I think only the cabins don’t have AC, but they are incredible and it’a literal paradise.",40,773
This is now one of our favorite places on the world! Super clean beautiful place made with respect to nature and run by people who have interest in conserving and respecting this natural beauty while offering a great comfort to their guests. We want to come back.!,50,773
"Beautiful rooms on stilts on the lagoon. Comfort is what can you can expect for this kind of room. Magical view. Do not miss the sunrise.  Food is ok and not expensive. Some activities to do on the lagoon, such as paddle or kayaking. Very nice staff. No A/C, but it is better for the environment.",50,773
"I’ve stayed with my other half for two days in Cabaña 1. What a beautiful place to be! The staff is super friendly and welcomed us perfectly.   Jaime took us around the hotel area (there is a huge land) and with all his love and attention made sure we could understand the purpose of the place. A sustainable and in complete unison with its environment.   For who comes you must visit the temple on site while you are here!  Remember: Instagram does not show the place how it really is, so don’t choose not coming based on photos.  The lake is breath taking!   Thank you to the amazing stay!   M and B x",50,773
"A simple and super nice hotel on a SUPER SPOT. The hotel rooms that face the water are literally on the lagoon. It´s a romantic spot that´s perfect to spend a day or two lying in the sun, and dipping on the fresh water.",40,773
"Loved the vibe, the bungalows and the food. I also took a massage and a reiki therapy, amazing!!!! I would only suggest they cleaned more the room. The walls had a bunch of previously dead mosquitos and the beds would get very dirty from the wind and were not cleaned. The rest, is a jungle experience you can’t miss.  ",40,773
"We were excited to stay here we were informed the morning of arrival at 9:30am that we could not enter the grounds until 3pm check in time. The gate would be locked for a retreat, no waiting at the restaurant, lobby or dropping off bags. We made the best of it of course and wondered around town with luggage. Nothing was done to make up for the inconvenience and at that price we are expected at least to be able to wait in a lobby. At the restaurant there was no fish for both days because of a group that came before, a bit disappointing as that’s half the menu. The temple was beautiful as were the grounds! ",20,773
"For us it was the closest experience to paradise. The place has a magic vibe since the main entrance. Going through the road to get to the hotel was truly enjoyable.  The hotel is absolutely nature friendly. We stayed at one of the 5 cabins. All of them on the lake. The private deck was perfect for our anniversary.  Everything works perfectly, the staff always helpful and caring. Made a big difference in the whole experience.  I wish I could have the opportunity to go back as much as we can!  ",50,773
Very cozy. The cabins are literally on the lagoon which make the deck view and the experience one of a kind. All the staff are super friendly. The saliing boat tour is a must. Would definitely return.,50,773
"This place is a gem. Tucked away right on the lagoon. The staff and service are amazing. On the grounds there is a permaculture garden, which you can tour, kayaks and paddle boards to take on the lake as well as a temple- that is artfully constructed. I hope to return soon. Highly recommend a stay while on the lake.",50,773
"Pros  Beautiful view, kayaks free to use. Small newly built detached compounds. Out door gym Cons Far from town on a bumpy dirt road. You need SUV. No fridge, no microwave, no tv, no wifi, no safe or place to hang clothes, Kitchen is far from the restaurant. It is not stocked. The employees make the best of what they they have. Takes 15 min for a cup of hot water for tea and 20+ for a cup of coffee. Pool dirty asked why they dont clean it. Employee said the pump was broken. We then tried to fill the large size tub in the room only a drizzle of water comes out. asked if it could be fixed. They said there was a water shortage. No hot water for shower.  Had to ask to turn on water heater.  Dont like giving bad reviews but we should  have the basics for the money we paid for.",10,774

"Basics are not settled: check in is a mess (hotel was empty and they couldn't check my family in before 3 pm claiming hotel was full), garbage is burnt just next to the rooms (when complaining about it they offered a bottle of wine for the inconvenience... WHAAT?? Wine in exchange of my health?? ), showers are next to toilets (you can imagine WC end up soaked after showering);  drain in bathrooms smell really bad ; pool is dirty; food is expensive and meh (we ate everyday out); it's very far from Bacalar center (costs $10 dlls per trip just to get there). The owner was in the hotel and it became evident that his comfort was much more important vs guests (i.e. the little to no wifi was disconnected from common areas and put into his room). Staff is amateur and really poorly",40,774
" managed, they have good intentions but can't compensate vs owner prioritie's and unexperienced in the hotel business (we heard him talking poorly about his staff in front of the guests). We won't go back there! Prices are double vs other hotels and it is definitely NOT worth the cost. ",30,774

"When you finally, after a 10 minute drive on a putt-hole filled, bumpy road reach the property, you are greeted by an amazing view on Lagoon Bacalar. The neatly designed lay-out of the hotel with its weirdly shaped, put privacy-improving sit/swimming-pool, of which only one of the two Jacuzzis functions, gives you a perfect hide-away to relax, weren't it for the bad service and underwhelming amenities. Even though they offer free use of their kayaks and you can rest idyllically in one of the hammocks, you are left wanting for some basic amenities, such as a fridge, safe, bin or some form of steady internet connection, even though advertised. The five-star unworthy service drastically lowers the quality of your stay. Even though you could start the day with an 8 a.m. breakfast,",50,774
De foto's kloppen maar de service is een grote zero ! Zeer ongeïnteresseerd en als je geen wagen hebt moet je al een taxi hebben voor een simpel drankje want tegen de vroege avond is de bar /resteau gesloten als t al open gaat en de winkel aan de overkant is ook vroeg gesloten en aan de receptie hoef je niks te vragen  ! De prijzen van een kayak zijn overdreven hoog . Ook de kamer werd niet opgefrist maar kon k nog meeleven als ze al verse handdoeken hadden gebracht ...maar nee ;) t  ontbijt is schaars en de deur word gesloten zo dat je moet wachten tot ze je zien wachten ;) ,20,775

Possibilité de louer des kayaks directement au départ de l'hôtel pour 100 pesos par heure par kayak (qui sont 1 place).  L'hôtel reste suffisant pour 2 nuits sur Bacalar.",20,775
"Estamos haciendo un viaje por carretera Cdmx- Cancún, y este hotel fue el lugar que elegí para descansar en Bacalar, principalmente por encontrarse a la orilla de la laguna Bacalar. La publicidad que usa este hotel es engañosa, fotos que muestran un lugar sencillo pero con lo necesario para una cómoda estancia.  Pero a nuestra llegada tuvimos una mala experiencia. El lugar requiere mucho mantenimiento en las puertas del baño y de la habitacion que en la parte inferior están desgastadas o rotas y permiten el paso de insectos al interior del cuarto, y no cuentan con seguro de ninguna clase, solo girar la perilla y el ingreso es fácil para cualquiera. Hablar del baño es quizá la peor parte: En la habitación no había toallas de mano, que solicitamos pero nunca entregaron,  me quedé",10,775
" con la llave del agua fria, en la mano; nunca salió agua tibia  solo agua fria, al informar al responsable sus respuestas fueron: es la llave izquierda, cierre y vuelva abrir, llamaré a mantenimiento, ""otro cliente lo reportó y así lo resolvió ya no regreso"" sin tener la certeza que realmente se resolvió.  Hora y media después de nuestra llegada solicite la cancelación y reembolso del importe de la habitación y lo hicieron, cosa que agradezco porque nos permitió buscar en lugar en mejores condiciones.",20,775

"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The property could use a bit more love (ie. the pier is broken in a few places, the garden can use some trimming, etc).  We asked for a two bedroom, which we received. But the second room was more like a walk in closet converted into a bedroom. It's great for kids, but probably a bit more uncomfortable for adults.

"My boyfriend and I have been spending the past 5 nights here and have witnessed how committed to the guests the staff are here at the hotel. Last night, the incredible bartender and waiter Miguel moved the dining table out to the sundeck at sunset and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner oceanside. It was incredible and made us feel so special.   William, the hotel manager has been wonderful as well, helping us book taxis, find bike rentals, booked our massage and has made us very comfortable and welcome here.   This truly feels like a little spot of paradise here on Isla Mujeres.",50,777
"My husband and I were so excited to return to Hotel La Joya, after staying here in 2017 and having a wonderful experience. This time was significantly different. It is still a gorgeous, unique and (mostly) quiet place to stay, but the property needs some serious maintenance and the follow through/attentiveness of the staff has definitely declined since our last stay. The most constant and easily preventable issue was breakfast. It is supposed to be delivered each morning (set on the table outside your room) based on what you write on the piece of paper they give you. It is one of the reasons we chose this hotel. Yet, what it says on the paper (""leave this paper outside your room each night and we'll pick it up at 7a each morning"") does not happen. Each morning, we had to go up",30,777
" to the kitchen to ask if they'd forgotten us, or we had to ask for a new piece of paper each day. The man in the office could not be bothered to get out of his chair to help and just pointed to the kitchen/restaurant when we tried to get more clear instructions/information.  The continential breakfast itself is great and sitting on our patio looking out at the water HAD BEEN one of our favorite things about this hotel. But, having to figure out the dysfunctional system and asking what was going on each morning kind of ruined the experience. In addition, the outlets in the room sparked every time you plugged something in (fire hazard), wifi constantly dropped in the room, and when we asked for change for a $20 dollar bill, they gave us less than the amount back in pesos. Also, aside from the amazing Miguel, most staff just seemed completely annoyed when you asked a question or tried to speak to them. Lastly, don't bother tipping if you order food/drinks from the restaurant or pool. They add a service charge to every order, which we were also not informed about and therefore tipped everyone.   Oh, and not the fault of the hotel, but the once-quiet and serene cove below the property, where we loved watching sunsets has been infested by huge, party boats and yachts that blare their music most of the day. It was hard to enjoy the pool and beautiful deck with that going on every day.  We love Isla and will definitely be back but we'll probably try a different hotel or maybe an Airbnb next time we visit.",40,777

"This is a charming secluded place. The view was spectacular and really made the place. The decor is old Mexican and we enjoy that. Service was good. Only small gripe was the breakfast service. Although delicious, they didn't really make it as easy as it should have been. We kinda felt we were begging for something that was included. Pool is small, but clean. Steps are a nightmare, but other reviews warned us. We made an informed choice to save money, but probably not for us again due to minor disabilities.",40,777
We stayed at this cute hotel once before and liked it.  However this trip was very disappointing.  First day we woke up to chain saws and hammering because they were doing work on the property.   I complained but they still continued the noise our entire stay.  It was quiet the day we were leaving.   We only had ONE vacation in 2021 so it’s unfortunate we had to hear so much noise.  You couldn’t even sit by the pool.  We won’t be back,50,777
"As corona is still blocking a lot of people from travelling some hotels offer a limited number of iptions. Such was the case with la Joya. Having aaid that, the place is beautiful, set in a lot of green in a secluded spot.Thr rooms all have sea view and are well appointed. In the morning breakfast was served at the patio of our room which was really nice. All in all a very nice stay....",50,777
"Manager Oswaldo is a true gentleman. A world class concierge. This place is lucky to have him.   This was our last three nights before our return to Europe. The only room that could accommodate four people did not have the view we expected and we were obviously dissapointed. He immediately found a solution by moving us to a better room for that night and said he would try to find a solution for the remaining two nights, but because everything was fully booked he couldn't promise anything. Hours later he delivered the good news - he had worked his magic and managed to find a great solution for us.   This seemingly simple manouvre meant everything to us since this would be the last sunsets we would experience on our Mexican adventure. Thank you again Oswaldo, dear Sir, we will",50,777
" never forget you! Shame we missed you when we left. I wanted a photo with you and to say goodbye properly. Oh well, that just means we have to come back! ;-)  Miguel, by the bar was also very professional and friendly. He served the best mango mojito my wife, myself -and by the looks of it every guest in hotel- have ever tasted!   Our only critique was the music by the pool bar. So unnessesary!

Mega sized ants in the room, sometimes in the bed. The shared bathrooms were pretty gross, the floors were always soaking wet and they were tiny cubicles containing a shower and a toilet! The receptionist one day tried to charge me £15 per towel as they had stains on, one was just shampoo, I mean, aren’t white towels going to get stains on?! Especially when they’re poor quality fabric. The food in the restaurant however was pretty good. There aren’t any sun beds around the pool area, a few bean bags at best.

"This is potentially a great boutique hotel.   The plus's are many and the negatives are few.   The rooms are basic with good beds, a good bathroom facility, and the staff does a great job of daily room service.   The biggest downside is the distance to get to the north beach, which if you don't want to walk the 20 minutes, you can hail a bus for 20 pesos per person or a cab is 80 pesos.   The other downside is late evening noise from the neighboring hostel.  The breakfast room on the top floor offers great value for cold or hot breakfast, and the very best views of Isla Mujueres.

We stayed here for 2 nights and suffered. The smell i the room was so bad, and their solution was to call a cleaning person to spray bad perfume. It was a joke. We wanted to leave the hotel because I couldn’t stop throwing up from the bad smell. The manager apologized and said I can check out and he will refund the money through the third party. I contacted the third party I made the reservation with and found out he lied and said he never said that! He started making up this crazy story about it. Now  i have 3 nights I paid for and are wasted because I trusted his words. Such a horrible",10,780

"We wrote to the hotel that we will arrive a bit early and they said we can't get the rooms before 15:00, at 15:00 they said the rooms are nor ready and they have only one cleaning worker, at 15:30 they said in will take one more hour, I came back 16:30 and they said it is still not ready, When i said it's not OK the receptionist (fani) told me to go and complain to the manager which will be here tommorow.  I booked the rooms one month ago but they said they were not ready for us to come today. Worst service ever. Just don't come to this hotel.",20,780
"I spent a three-day weekend at this all-inclusive and I enjoyed my stay. The staff was nice, although it took them a long time to bring drinks, even when the pool or dining room was not busy. We had a large room with two queen beds and the room cleaning service was good. I loved the large bathrooms. They only thing missing from the room was a chair and desk, which was odd because there was enough space. I don't think that I will return to Isla Mujeres. It was exhausting coming from the airport to the ferry terminal to the island and then having to wait in a long line for a taxi to Belo. I did not find the island attractive. It's very over-developed without any apparent urban planning by local authorities.",50,780
Let me start by saying the service is excellent the people are friendly. Polite and truly want to make your stay rememberable.  However the booking process was less than forthright. Our reservation total was $987 American when we got to the hotel they charge us $1250 American and then claimed that the bank took the rest of a charge for the transfer rate which is bowl because I paid by credit card and the visa card handles the exchange rate also they put us in a smaller room we had booked a junior suite and when we asked to move they said we can do that but it would have to be a road view not an ocean view no price reduction just have a nice day and enjoy the smaller room for the bigger room price not an overall great experience,20,780
"Excellent Service, excellent food, excellent location!!! On south side of the island (quieter) which is what I preferred. still easy to get in to town. Beautiful rooms, property. Front desk was amazing as well as the food (so good). Do not have one bad thing to say. Could of used in house laundry service (just a thought ') Thank you Hotel Belo for an incredible holiday",30,780
"This is a lovely hotel, however, they have a system of transferring USD to pesos that causes them to overcharge. The young lady at the desk took the amount she said was due for the room and multiplied it by 20 (the amount she said each $1 USD was worth). However, she did that on a simple calculator. The rate per USD was actually less and she just rounded up which caused me to be over charged. Even after explaining that, she was convinced she was actually even charging me less than my reservation confirmation. If this is a system they have in place instead of regularly checking transfer rates they may have overcharged many of their customers without the customer realizing it. Even after showing her the ACTUAL USD charge she still was convinced it was a problem with my bank and",20,780
From the moment I booked I was treated with White Glove service from Alexander!  He is amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay here FANTASTIC!!!  Rooms are decorated with the right amount of neutral colors- not to take away from the beauty of the island and the views from room.  Enjoy your stay- you will not be disappointed!!,50,781
"Our travel agent recommended Lotus Beach Hotel and I'm so glad he did! We came here after a stay at one of my favorite places in Playa del Carmen, which is hard to top, but Lotus Beach topped it! The whole place is beautiful and has a wonderful feel.  We were greeted with the house drink, the Guru (a delicious take on a margarita, with passion fruit and habenero) and cool towels, then taken to our amazing room with its own private plunge pool overlooking the beach. The room amenities were top notch (BVLGARI shampoo and conditioner, even!). The staff were all wonderful and attentive, and even pulled out a number of birthday surprises for my wife. Special shout-outs to Mayte V. and Alexander at the front office for being so customer-focused, helpful, and friendly. (And to Natalia",50,781
" for her explanation of Mayan astrology, which was fascinating.) Mayte especially felt like a friend who just so happened to work here.  The food and drinks were all terrific. In addition to the Guru, I highly recommend the Agra - it's like a Pina Colada but not frozen and not overly sweet. The ceviche serving size is massive and could be a full meal all by itself, and we could not stop eating that and the various tacos. The pool/bar area was a great place to hang out when we weren't enjoying our private plunge pool. Lotus Beach is a beach club that's open to the public but that was fully disclosed on the website and we felt that as hotel guests, we did get special perks unavailable to the general public. We were a little worried that it would be too loud, especially as we were there over a long weekend, but the beach club noise level was just fine and by the evening, it felt like a private getaway. I highly recommend Lotus Beach Hotel!",50,781
…,30,781
"We had absolutely no idea about the Island but kept on seeing Lotus on searches. I called one day and Alexander answered. From that 1 min call we then msged as I was in the UK. Honestly we have never experienced customer service like it. Alex used to send me the odd message, even room upgrade when availability changed. He couldn’t have done enough. Unfortunately we never got to meet as he was away for our visit but everyone at Lotus was fantastic. It’s definitely the coolest vibe on Playa Norte. The afternoon DJ and live band really made for some great afternoons in the sun, with some great people X",40,781
"I was extremely disappointed after staying 3 nights here.  Maybe I would rate it higher if there wasn’t such a mismatch between the sticker price and the experience.  It is not a tranquil, zen-like place as their website implies.  Rather, it’s a beach club with some nice rooms too.  For example, we arrived at about 3:30pm last Friday and wanted to have lunch after traveling. There was a 7-piece band and about 50-60 people around the pool patio, rocking their butts off.  Good band and people were really enjoying themselves, looking well liquored.  Anyways, there were so many people in that pool area, that looks so relaxing on the website, that we had to take a table INSIDE. I live in Chicago so have had plenty of that at this point in January.  It felt very odd watching everybody",50,781
" having such a good time out there for some reason.  Oh ya!  Doesn't this place only have 6 rooms total?  We were specifically allowed only 2 people in our room.  How big are these 5 other rooms? The food was good, the service mediocre at best but not surprising given how hard the staff had to work to accommodate all those other people, who obviously must have had lots of drink orders.   We didn’t eat there again so cannot accurately rate their food.  Just keep in mind that this place is open to the public (see picture) and you can just walk right in off the beach.  This was a huge surprise to us and the reason we had to eat lunch inside.   If you don't mind the crowd, you may have a very different opinion of this place than I do.  We weren't there for the party.  There was another band performing on Sunday and the crowd was similar. On Saturday, even without the band the patio was crowded with people walking in off the beach.  We didn't feel comfortable hanging out at any point, at all, during our stay, and chose instead to lay out on the sand around the corner with the provided beach towels which were kinda thin and cheap but work just fine.  Really wanted to have a bit of relaxing pool time but this turned out to be a pure beach trip for us. We love the beach probably more than the pool anyways and Playa Norte is totally amazing.  Shallow warm calm beautiful water.  Great beach and this resort has an amazing location to enjoy it.  Room #2 (of six total) was ours for 3 nights.  Plunge pool suite.  Very nice.  Unheated pool as expected.  But there must be a thing with hot water here because they only provided 7 minutes of it in our shower. We brought the issue to their attention and the concierge, really nice guy (sorry I forget his name) came quickly with the maintenance guy and explained that there was one hot water boiler exclusively for our room.  Although they offered to switch our room, we remained.  We were told someone would fix the issue tomorrow morning.  We noticed zero difference throughout our stay. The hot water we did get was super hot and the pressure was great, probably too good relative to the size of the hot water tank.  It's a manageable affair, not the end of the world, but another big surprise. Another guest at the hotel said they also had an issue with hot water but did not elaborate.  We were very sad to learn that there is plenty of noise into the evening around this zen-inspired land.  My favorite was Sunday night Karaoke coming from Mia across the way.  It only went on until about 10pm but we could hear it inside our room despite having everything closed and the a/c on. There is a beach bar nearby and we heard their music another night.  The biggest disappointment is this place uses words like unique and exclusive on their website, when in fact it is open to the public.  I had to pay over $700USD per night for a non-exclusive experience.  It didn't feel like a ""sumptuous luxury experience"".  It felt misleading.  Next time, I’ll just walk in off the beach and buy a couple of beers for the false sense of privilege. The staff was courteous and friendly and wants to help and I hesitate to write such a negative review as stuff rolls downhill, if you know what I mean but this resort was nothing like I expected.  I'm still upset   Perhaps, I’m being too generous with my review.",50,781
…,50,781
"Great place. Staff was very attentive. Some of the staff went above and beyond!! Just be weary…it is a Beach Club first and a boutique hotel second. We were super excited to stay here, seemed exclusive since there were only six rooms. BUT, they have daily walk-in guests that pay to use the pool and beach and the staff caters to them. That’s fine if you advertise that clearly on your hotel website. We were very much taken aback by that. It was still enjoyable, but when you read only six rooms, understand that the hotel gets extremely busy during the day and especially during the weekends. I don’t write many reviews but I had to let other travelers know.",50,781
"July 4th birthday celebration at the amazing Lotus Beach Hotel. This property is private, with beautiful decors. The location is private with the plunge pool right outside of your door.

"NIGHTMARE FOR COUPLES! Overpriced ‘hotel rooms’ in a hostel with loud party music all day until 2 am. Unfriendly and uninterested staff at the reception who do not care to give you a good stay.

Instead of catching some sleep and relaxing, we had a very unpleasant stay.",10,782
"Was there for nearly a week at this lush tropical sanctuary.  Never stayed at a hotel/hostel but I really like it and would come back again and again.   Traveled with a friend (both LGBT travelers)  and we felt very comfortable.     Nice mix of party and chill atmosphere.  Service was great and the shinning stars were Jose and Rafa.   Very attentive and always smiling.  But everyone there was generally nice.  The room was ok it was a little beat up.   It was a room with two beds but you can tell it was a dorm with all the lockers.  It was quite beat up for the price, but we honestly didn’t stay in the room much. I recommend updating though.  A small fridge would be nice and a safe.   Overall experience was 5 stars.   Thank you everyone at Nomads",50,782
"Nomads is an absolutely beautiful place. The location on the beach is great to chill during the day and the large deck provides amazing sunset views. I love that some nights they have live music and on other nights a DJ is playing. I have stayed in both the female 8 person dorm and in private rooms and both were great: the rooms are beautiful, clean and the beds are very comfy. The staff is very kind and willing to help (especially Arturo the manager), the cocktails are great and the food from the foodmarket is tasty for fair prices (try the habanero mango chicken wings and the quesadillas!!). 10/10 would recommend.",50,782
"This hostel is absolutely beautiful.   From the decor, to the large airy bright dorms with large lockers, comfie beds, doesn't feel cramped.  Even a balcony to air dry our towels and swimsuits. Toilets and showers kept clean. Grounds are amazing. Pool is so pretty. You feel very zen here. Like being in the jungle. One of my favourite hostels i've ever stayed in.  Would return.",50,782
"It's impossible to sleep because the bar plays the music all the night at a volume so high that the windows are vibrating. When you check-in they tell you that this is a party hotel but in the description of the hotel there wasn't any suggestion that this would have been the situation, and of course you find out the reality of the place when it's to late to get your money back (a pretty good amount of money btw). I'm giving one out of 5 just because i can't give 0. The worst place of mexico with no doubt, and it achieved the hard task to ruin the memories of a paradise such as Isla Mujeres",10,782
We enjoyed your outstanding service in an extraordinary place. Thank you for having us it was an experience we will never forget The partys were great and the vibe and drinks aswell. The hotel is amazingly located we have enjoyed the sunsets and beach.   Greetings Laura and the swiss chicas,50,782
"Amazing place to stay and party. As a solo traveler I loved the vibe, the staff and volunteers were always very friendly and helpful :) Loooooved the smoothies every morning by the beach (prettiest beach club I’ve ever seen) I’ll definitely be back soon!",50,782
"I had the best experience of my life! Arturo accommodated our group for an amazing stay! Reservations were easy, and the beach parties unfortunately (even with all the incredible tequila)! Bar tenders were beautiful and entertaining! I can’t wait till my next stay!",50,782
I am so thankful for the wonderful staff at Nomads. I was here for a yoga retreat on the island and had a blast. The staff were so delightful and helpful! Our lodgings in the hostel were clean and met my standards. I received great recommendations on things to do on the island. Nomads is such a beautiful paradise. The hammocks and furniture set up on the beach is a dream. The parties at Nomads were so fun and lively! We met so many great people from all over the world. This was a great experience! I definitely want to come back for another vacation!,50,782
"I stayed here as a part of a yoga retreat in isla mujeres.  I loved how they incorporated nature into the buildings there are plants and palm trees everywhere!  I ended up staying in a shared room with 7 other women for the retreat the room had 2 restrooms, 2 bathrooms and AC unit, lockers and a balcony with a hammock.  There is access to the beach with a bar and a pool attached to it.  There is a pier you can jump into the water from which was a lot of fun! Only downside is that the stairs you use to climb back up to the pier aren’t long enough and you have to use a lot of upper body strength to climb back to the pier. Only alternative is to swim back to the shore which isn’t ideal when there are strong waves and you aren’t a strong swimmer.  Otherwise the staff is super nice",50,782
"Playa La Media Luna was perfect. It was in a great location, the price was right, and the scenery from the pool was beautiful. It may not have been the newest build on Isla but by no means was it dumpy or dirty. One of the managers (unfortunately I forgot his name) gave us some fantastic restaurant recommendations.  I would definitely stay here again.",50,783
"Just terrible. We stayed here our last night to go to a “nicer” place for one night. Do yourself a favor and don’t. We can definitely recommend Casa Azul Maya!  - no hospitality - everything in our tiny dingy room was cheap and on the verge of breaking or was broken - no continental breakfast available anymore  - we arrived an hour before check in and rang the bell at the front desk, I was addressed with a very annoyed looking woman saying “digame!?” (Tell me in Spanish). Needless to say there was definitely no way I can check in early and no offer to hold my bags or hang by the pool while I wait.  - the man showing us our room had 0 hospitality as well and before I could even say thank you he was like where’s my tip?  I could go on but that is hopefully enough to convince you",10,783

I wish I could take credit for finding this gem but my neighbor gets all the kudos.  Words to describe this hotel: quaint; great location; terrific view especially at sunrise; quiet during our visit; comfy beds and pillows; nicely sized rooms; nice pool furniture; small beach but take caution in swimming (red flag area); one block from the bus stop and Covid test station; three short blocks to the north end of Hidalgo Street.  This hotel is not an all-inclusive but there are many wonderful restaurants nearby.  The hotel bar is small but Rico was attentive.  The pool area is nice and has they have shallow pool for kids.  My room did not have a hair dryer but one was provided upon request.,50,783
"Special is the best word to describe Playa la Media Luna.  Very private and quite retreat away from the action in Isla, and only a few short blocks away.  The pool & beach area are some of the most majestic views and scenery you will ever experience.  Staff there was absolutely great and everyone treats you like family.   If you are lucky enough to find your self in Isla, you absolutely have to book an offshore fishing trip or three with Captain Buddy on the Keen M II.  World class sailfish bite with some of the best mates in the world.  Capt will put you on the fish and make sure everyone is having a great time. ( hotel can book fishing for you)   Great destination for a boys trip, girls get away, family vacation, or romantic celebration with your boo.   Can’t thank the whole",50,783

"We loved this location and hotel so much!   It’s located a block away from everything in Isla… it is just a few blocks away from the main strip too. Grocery store within walking distance.. tons of restaurants and souvenirs too. There are also plenty of scuba shops for those interested in arranging Adventure trips or scuba diving.  Hotel can rent you a golf cart to roam the island, for 24 hrs at  $60USD per day… cash only.  Everything from check in to check out was perfect. The peace and tranquility of this location is worth every moment and dime you will spend.   The hotel is located in an area with a little private beach. The rooms are spacious and the air-conditioning works beautifully! We rented the full-size apartment with two bedrooms, living room and kitchenette. We had a",10,783
"I absolutely loved my stay at Casa de los Sueños. My boyfriend and I were there for 2 days and 3 nights for a quick vacation and couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, relaxing spot.  The room was great! Colorful, quirky decor (preferable IMO over a stuffy sterile hotel room vibe), very comfortable bed, and an absolutely breathtaking view of the ocean!  The infinity pool was perfect. We went during the ""off-season"" I think so we were generally the only ones in the pool which was amazing. Felt like a private oasis!  The Kin Ha beach club is just a 2 minute walk down towards the ocean and provides ocean front meals, pools + bar, and an awesome dock with steps right into the gorgeous ocean. I was worried I'd miss having direct beach access, but turns out this was even better!",50,784
" Ocean access without the hot sand :)  We also rented a golf cart for our time there which I would definitely recommend. Casa de los Sueños is on the south, more chill side of the island, but with our cart we were able to zip into town for food and to the north side of the island for a little beach time (~15 minute cart ride)  Great hotel and great service. Definitely recommend for a more relaxing Isla Mujeres getaway!",50,784

"We honestly loved our stay at Casa de Los Suenos. We travelled around Yucatan over 15 days including  stays at some of the best known All Inclusives but this was by far our favourite hotel. The views are beautiful, the beds are comfortable (and large!) and the welcome drinks in the fridge a bonus.   The beach club offers the use of paddle boards, kayaks and snorkels with a swing off the deck into the sea. All great fun.   Finally, the staff (and the pets!) are fabulous and really helpful.  We spent a lovely evening talking with Carlos about his life adventures over a pizza! :-)  We did not want to leave and really hope to be back in the future.",50,784

I will probably go back!",50,784

They stored the luggage after we checked out.  I loved everything about this place. The food is delicious and healthy. Breakfast was included and we enjoyed breathtaking views. I snorkeled right at the end of their long dock.. and was so surprised to see schools of colorful fish everywhere.   I used their kayak for an exciting ride.  We swam in the crystal clear ocean and also in all of their  ocean front infinity pools.  The lounge chairs were plentiful and towels were supplied.  ",50,784
"Casa de los Suenos offered us an excellent location for our short visit to Isla Mujeres. Folks of all ages, including many Mexican families, were there during our stay. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable though not fancy. Restaurant was very good, with delicious and generous breakfasts included in the room price. The swimming area was as lovely and shallow; the water was a glorious turquoise color and it is shallow enough for kids to swim and even learn to snorkel or kayak. Service was great—super friendly and helpful. It is a 100 peso ($5 US) taxi ride to the busy center of town. This hotel is on the south end of the island where it is quieter. ",50,784

You can easily enjoy all day on site! ",50,784

Highly recomended. Can't wait to go back.",50,784

"We stayed at Hotel Secreto for our final three nights of a three week Mexican vacation. Without a doubt it was our best three nights in Mexico. Just a very short walk from the beach, food carts and restaurants, the hotel feels a 1,000 miles away from everything - truly a secret hideaway. It was totally relaxing. The rooms were large, spotless, and beautifully appointed. There was plenty of hot water and great water pressure in the shower. The king sized bed was super comfortable and it was the best sleep of our vacation. We spent hours laying out on our personal deck listening to the ocean or cooling off in the pool, and the view can't be beat. (DEFINITELY treat yourself to the ocean view - it's SO worth it!)  And don't forget the spa -- great massages. The staff was attentive",50,785

"When was the last time you felt genuine sadness at checking out of a hotel? Not just end-of-a-vacation sadness but proper this-was-a-one-in-a-million-experience-that-I-may-never-experience-again sadness? For us this was that time. Sure, there are hotels that cost the earth, provide every facility under the sun and pamper you to within an inch of your life. And maybe there’s a place for those kind of hotels. But for me this is everything a hotel should be: small enough to feel like a community, friendly enough that you get to know the staff by name, luxurious without being pretentious or trying to be cool. Scott the owner is one of the Good Guys of the world; you get the impression that all he cares about is your happiness and you leave with the impression that your life is a",50,785

We had a wonderful stay and have only fabulous comments regarding the resort, rooms, the beach and pool areas and of course, the amazing staff! We love the small feel to the resort as it only has 35 rooms. The restaurants are both delicious and we really enjoyed our 7 course tasting two nights we visited. The rooms all have excellent views and are clean, comfortable. We had some amazing staff we would like to thank: Malena, Luis, Thank you for accommodating our small dog,  Buddy.

"From catamaran pickup to ferry departure, this was an amazing experience.   The transfer from airport to Dreams Vista dock was easy and then the walk to the catamaran gave us a chance to see the property of Dreams Vista. Be aware there is a little walk and climbing aboard a small catamaran on a floating dock.   Upon arrival, we were welcomed home and easily checked in with 4 other couples. They had this process perfectly scheduled so everyone was helped at once. This was unlike anything we had previously experienced. Such a time savings!   Room-we booked and received a ground floor veranda room (106). In our opinion, these are the best rooms as you can just return to your room thru sliders to use restroom or grab stuff. The shower was the best single person stall we have ever",50,786
" had, at any resort. The hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great!  Food-we did not find any food we did not like. The 7 course tasting menu was interesting and quite tasty. There were things we didn't care for, but we knew that beforehand by looking at the menus. Make your reservations when you arrive for whatever days you want. They have the full weeks menus to review. The views from the main restaurant were extraordinary and the breezes we devine. Our absolute favorite breakfast was French Toast. The grilled fish and grilled salmon were delicious. If you don't see what you want on the menu, ask. They are very accommodating and will try to make whatever you want.   Beach-we aren't really beach people other than to see that a resort has a beautiful beach for the view. It appeared to us that everyone on the beach enjoyed it. It is small, but plenty of chairs and umbrellas   Housekeeping-while the service you receive is amazing, they could definitely improve their attempt to accommodate time requests. We requested our room be cleaned early, morning by 10am. Most days we had to remind them to clean our room around 1 or 1:30. Mini-bar was very disappointing as we received our refresh once and other times had to complain to get restocked.   Entertainment-Leo is THE entertainment for this resort. He works very hard and is extremely friendly and pleasant. His ""specialty drinks"" are a treat and a must try!   UVC/VIP Desk-was very nice to be greeted by name each time we passed through the lobby. These two people (Malena & Luis) work very hard to provide you with everything you need for a fantastic vacation.   If you visit this resort, make friends with other guests. We have made several new friends which made our stay even more fantastic.   Other than housekeeping/mini-bar replenishment, the only thing we could possibly complain about is  smoking being allowed everywhere. Everything we read said that smoking was allowed in designated areas only and not at the pools. While the resort seems to never want to tell a guest no, this policy worked against us as I am allergic to cigarette smoke and had to leave the pool/lobby/pool deck anytime someone lit up. They even gave one guest an ashtray IN THE POOL. ",30,786

"This resort is beautifully located on the island of Isla Mujeres, just a short ferry from Cancun.  Although there are only two restaurants on the property, the food is the most delicious we have ever had at an all-inclusive resort! The staff is amazing.  The pools are quiet and relaxing and the beach small but nice.  And although this is a family friendly resort, I saw only 3 children the entire time I was here.  It's a sleepy little resort, not much to do, but if you are looking for a little more adventure you can rent a golf cart and explore the little town or hit up the beautiful beach on the other side of the island.  The sunrise at Punta Cana is not to be missed!  And I hear the snorkling of the underwater museum is amazing to see, although we did not have time to try it",50,786
 out.  The rooms are large and some of the balconies even have a jacuzzi tub.  If you are looking for a boutique hotel to relax and unwind then the Zoetry Villa Rolandi is perfect!,50,786

A lovely relaxing stay.  The major positives -   - 10/10 food. Wide enough choice to keep you interested over 10 days. - Really friendly staff (special mention to the lads working the drinks at the pool) - Amazing views - seriously amazing  Would I come again. Yes.   A few minor negatives.  - yes it needs a bit of TLC  - a couple more pool umbrellas  Other than that it’s a quality place .  Thanks to all the staff that made us very welcome.,50,786
"I stayed here in March, the weather was absolutely amazing and the hotel services was top notch. I stayed in the suite with the room that had the balcony bathtub facing the dock. Amazing view.   I left in a hurry and I left my Laptop underneath the sheets and Daniel, the manager was able to ship the laptop back to me in the United States. Daniel, from start to end with exceptional customer service, even when I was no longer a customer. Many thanks !",50,787
"This trip was amazing! The hotel was very clean and well appointed! From the hotel staff to the restaurant and pool bar staff, everyone went above and beyond to ensure your enjoyment. I especially want to thank Claudia who took care of us at the main pool bar. She was very sweet, and fun, and made sure we had everything we wanted/needed. She never missed a beat! We can’t wait to return!",50,787
Probably the best experience of my 30 day vacation.  They are not kidding when they say you will swim with the whale sharks twice. When the whale shark appears it’s a go go go and you are so close to this whale shark. It was a great experience. Afterwords we could swim in this very nice area and look for marine life. It was great. Manuel is very helpful too,50,787
"Being my first time traveling to Cancun this was the best experience, couldn’t have asked for a better hotel. I absolutely enjoyed my stay with Izla hotel. The staff is amazing and the service as well. Josefina, Luis, Mauricio, Alexis, Claudia and Eduardo did a phenomenal job making us feel like home. Their service is just perfect. I enjoyed every bit of it and I don’t regret it. Foood is delicious. I totally recommend. Would definitely come back!!!!",50,787
"We spent a lot of time at the pool with my 4yo, Claudia and Saray were excellent servers as were their bartender counterparts Abdulio and Alonzo. Alfredo and josefina were also great in our brief interactions. We also ate frequently at Numo restaurant while there, it was phenomenal food, great wine selection and major kudos to the chef—amazing flavor profiles, presentation and service from Roberto Baak and Rodmin.   The spa staff (Marco) and the nail technicians were also super friendly and knowledgeable. The front desk, Daniel was lovely and helpful. Griselda also assisted with issue resolution regarding a billing issue which originates with their corporate office in Cancun. That remains unresolved. I would book directly in future, or just not via Expedia. Other than that",50,787
" issue, it was really peaceful and relaxing. The resort is very well maintained. Little or no room to room noise. One tip to put lots of towels down in the bathroom as it is slippery when it gets wet, and kids will need to sit in the shower for the same reason. Overall a great vacation, beautiful relaxing location with kind and skilled hospitality staff.",50,787

"This was our first real vacation in three years.  We stayed for 7 nights and did the half board meal plan. The resort was closed for a year and just reopened in December.  That being said except for a few minor service issues everything was spectacular.  The breakfast buffet was pretty elaborate and had something for everyone. Gimer, the manager took great care of us.  We had dinner at NUMA, the more formal restaurant pretty much every night since dinner was included in our plan. Roberto Baak, the head waiter did an awesome job.  He was super attentive and he prepared a table side flambé for us on one occasion.  We had fresh fish every night and all the food was amazing.  I have been a NY Restaurant GM for 20 years  so I have very high standards.  They are training a lot of new",50,787
" staff post COVID so just be understanding of that. They go over the top to correct any service issues.  The chef was top notch.  For example the catch of the day came with patty pan squash, candy cane beets and mini stemmed carrots which was an unexpected delight.  Amazing quality and freshness.  It was worth the $40pp per day to include breakfast and  dinner.  The tip is also included in the price.  (Best deal we found was on booking.com) They will also let you switch from dinner to lunch if you want to try another restaurant on the island for dinner.   All the drinks were made with fresh fruit so we were quite happy about that.  The resort rents out golf carts to get around the island which is convenient and fun.  I recommend you book the golf cart early as they only have 4 of them.  It’s $74 for 24 hours.  The Hotel only gives you 18 pesos per $1 US so you might want to pay in pesos since the normal exchange rate is 21 pesos to the $.  Anyway,  we had a super fun vacation and will definitely return.",50,787

"We have been staying here at Privilege Aluxes for the past four years. We are always greeted by a very friendly staff at the front desk, Jesus, Johnny, Cynthia, Ofelia, and Ervin. They remember us and make us feel at home. The security staff are also very friendly. This is one of the many reasons why we continue to come to Privilege Aluxes.",50,788
"Beach, pool, sabor and satay service has been top notch. A few Outstanding individuals who have gone above and beyond, and I am missing some, are Dani, Misael,, Ricardo and Alex. We are welcomed every year with smiles, welcomes and hugs. The Outstanding individuals of this resort keep us coming back. See you next year!  Well done Diego!",50,788
Best resort on the Island. The staff was beyond accommodating. The rooms were extremely clean. The restaurants in the resort were 5 stars. The beach access was amazing. Not to mention the resort is located on the best spot on the entire island. We loved the fact we were able to rent golf carts right at the front desk of the resort. And you can't beat 24hr room service. ,50,788
"The resort was a great place for our honeymoon. Staff was awesome and very attentive, they work so hard. The island is a fun place to visit. Snorkeling is a must do while you’re here! Only downside we thought was we could hear out in the hallway pretty easily and our room was facing the street and there is a school right across the way. That didn’t ruin our experience at all, but the mornings were a little loud on a couple days. Overall would definitely recommend this resort! ",50,788
"I loved my stay at Privilege Aluxes, it was a dream vacation. I stayed in a deluxe suite and opted for the all inclusive plan. Great location, walking distance to the ferry & Hikdalgo. Great staff, beautiful room, I couldn’t ask for anything better. I left 2 weeks ago and already booked my next vacation for next year. I can not wait to go back!",50,788
"We have been to Privilege Aluxes 12 times and already have number 13 reserved.  There are a lot of repeat customers that visit PA.  Great place, great value but most importantly the people that work there are the very best and make up 90% of the reason there are so many repeat customers. ",50,788
"We love this hotel and our stay! The food is fantastic, service is great and location is perfect (only a five minute walk to the ferry, and beautiful beaches right here). Definitely recommend staying here if you plan to stay on Isla Mujeres. Jaime at the front desk and Samuel at the pool bar are great!",50,788
"Staying at Privilege Aluxes is nothing short of a dream, one that is made even more incredible by the wonderful Samuel on poolside. Attentive and lovely doesn’t even close to doing him justice! All of the staff are incredible. The service is world class and you’ll be made to feel like royalty every day!",50,788
"Let me first start off by saying we are experienced PA'ers and have been here multiple times. I see in other reviews how 'rude' some of the servers/workers might be.  First, I would say, that in my experience (getting ready to book my fourth trip to PA) that the staff here deals with a LOT of contentious guest.    During our last trip in early May, there was a huge family of Americans from an undisclosed state who behaved in such a way that I was EMBARASSED they represented the country I came from and fought for.  I was ashamed to be American, because of how incredibly RUDE these types of GUESTS can be to the STAFF!  I shook my head watching as they dry humped each other in the pool, disrespected the servers for having a language barrier (which everyone I know speaks English)",50,788
" and not understanding them, making incredibly rude remarks to other guests, being excessively loud IN ALL CASES (Restaurants, Beaches, Pool area). . . It was awful to watch.  We shared the resort for an entire week with them and attempted to avoid their vicinity at all costs!  Eww.  Seeing this made me realize… WE are coming to THEIR home expecting them to feed us American Cuisine and speak OUR language.  I say… WE should learn THEIR language and start treating THEM with the same respect we expect from them…  It isn't hard to be human.  I'm all for having a good time - lord knows I did, but being disrespectful to staff and other guests just because you think of yourself as an American Alpha Male isn't a good look for us!  You're giving us a bad reputation!  So I hope that anyone reading this review shows these guys the utmost respect they deserve.  They deal with a lot, and overall, are human.  Be Kind!   I can say that I have never felt that ANY worker here has treated us with ANYTHING other than respect and kindness.  What I am trying to say in this lengthy review is that although I was even contentious because my private transport I booked through them wasn't private.  I later apologized for being ill because I know and understand how hard these guys all work and ultimately stuff happens!  I wrote an email while being crammed in the back of a Sprinter Van with a dozen other people and told them how 'pissed' I was. I typically always book private, so this was new to me. I felt immediate regret when they responded back with 'Thank you for the kind email'…  I knew I had not been kind.. They didn't deserve that.  They always handle contention with class and grace and try to accomodate accordingly.  The staff, concierge, bell captains, pool cleaning guy and even the groundskeeper ensure this place is immaculate for us!  Be respectful back.  HUGO/JESUS always greets us warmly upon check in and answers all our questions, and even gives me change when all I have left are 500 pesos bills! LOL.  JOSE - Our favorite Bell Captain is always smiling and making sure we had what we needed.  (I was so in a rush to make it to the dock/airport I forgot to tip you, I promise to make it up to you in December! Sorry, Jose).  ALEX is my absolute favorite beach server, and we even had him as a server at Satay.  He's genuinely the kindest person, and was always incredibly attentive. DANI!!!!!!!  Oh my goodness, how we love him.  Such a hard worker.  I'm still not sure how you guys walk in that sand all day!  Great job! We can't wait to see you in December!  Thank you Dani & Alex for showing us a piece of Authentic Mexico!  We so appreciate you!  Let me just tell you about the Pool Bar, Ladies & Gents!  SAMUEL!!!!!!!!!!! You are an A++++ player.  Always laughing and smiling and telling us how excited he is to see us. He does this to all guest and it really makes them feel welcomed. It's fun to watch him interact with everyone. Like family.  Samuel is so fantastic at making sure our drinks stayed full, making recommendations on the food, and just making us laugh. And even remembered what I drank the year before.  RODRIGO, EPRAN, & IVAN always make our experience at the Pool enjoyable.  These guys really work hard at making sure we consistently have everything we want.  To the guest in the pool bar in the late afternoon.. Be patient.  We all know you want your YETI's filled up.  These guys probably make 12 drinks in a minute.  Give them some time and be patient.  This is our favorite place to hang out and listen to the Cuban music a few nights a week.  I wish I knew the name of the band… I go just to see them.   We stayed in the presidential suite which ROSA kept tidy for us each day.  Such a sweet lady! Always friendly and kind. Guests - Make sure to leave them tips each day! It is so well deserved.  I can't remember the most AMAZING ladies name who took care of our mini/wet bar!  But she was incredible and we really enjoyed listening to her rendition of the Beatles!  Sing it!  We will join you! She made us all smile!   SPA - I always go to the Spa at PA because I like to support the girls that work there.  They have always provided great services.  The first time I ordered a massage, I was able to use the steam room, shower, etc.  This time, I booked a couples massage for my sister and I but they took us straight to the room.  I wonder what I need to order to get the 'full' treatment..  I hate to say this, but the massages on the beach were 10 out of 10 and only $40/hr for a Swedish.  I will continue to support both because… why not.. I'm on vacation. :) I want ALL the massages!  BEACH - I like to get the Balinese Bed for at least two days out of my week.  I like the unobstructed views and the beds are fun to fall asleep on in between mojitos..  SPEAKING OF MOJITOS!!!  Mi Amigos!  You've ruined them! They are typically my drink of choice, to the point of a year later Alex knew even knew I drank mojitos (only on vacation though people :)).  When he brought me one I noticed that they started putting the essential oil on top..  And it was A LOT! So strong with peppermint I couldn't even drink it.  So I switched over to tang/tonic with lime which was satisfying. :)  Keep the mojitos simple! They were so much better in 2021!   SABOR - I'm not sure who the gentlemen is that 'runs' SABOR in the mornings, but he runs a tight ship! Kinda intimidating but always friendly. LOL.  I always enjoy watching him march around the room ensuring everyone is working like the well-oiled machine that they are.  The food here was fantastic. The servers always remember your drinks and are so amazing to you. The breakfast buffet had a mix of authentic and American style foods.  I much more prefer the authentic.  I left American to enjoy Mexico.  I don't want American style food down here too. :)  More authentic options por fa vor! Amo Mexico! Breakfast on the beach offers a few more authentic options and requires a reservation.  It's very nice there.  Uhhhh.  What else.. We walk from the ferry.  I hate waiting in line for taxi's and although we had one booked this time, we decided to walk anyways.  It's a short fun little jut up to the hotel.  We rented golf carts from the front desk.  It's a bit more expensive, but so much more convenient.  Otherwise, I go to Luxury a street away, but they've messed up my reservation so many times, that I just go to the front desk.  They are always super helpful in finding us a golf cart and having it delivered if ones not already available onsite. This hotel is fantastic in every aspect.  I have no idea who could possible complain or write negatively.  This is the place to be.  I only wish less people knew about it so I could enjoy it all to myself. Hhahahah.  Oh.  We always get flowers in the room, on the bed, and bottles of champagne with fruit and chocolate with the beds on the beach and in our room.  Quality stuff here!   The Room.. Dear God.. The Room.  #633. I've stayed in the Deluxe rooms and this last time booked the presidential.  The pool was warm some days, cooler the next.. But amazing every day.  I LIVE for this balcony! Enough to wake up two hours before anyone else, just so I could enjoy it all to myself!  We had a Balinese bed, two loungers & table and two bench chairs.  Where flip flops. It's slick.   The room had a wet bar with tequila, johnny walker scotch, spiced rum and absolute vodka.  A nice addition for end of day shenanigans.  We could have stayed in the room the entire time! I booked the Grand Platinum for December and am looking forward to the views and that sweet balcony again.   Thank you PA. For everything. For putting us obnoxious guests and for providing us a five star experience. I've officially decided to make this a twice a year venture.  It's my home away from home and I love everything about it.  Will everything always be perfect? probably not.. But they sure do try to make it that way.    Happy Traveling!",50,788
One of the best places I've ever stayed at. This place has just an amazing vibe and is located directly in front of the lagoon. The garden is super beautiful and from the Yoga Shala you have a stunning view at the lagoon. The vegan restaurant just serves natural and fresh food. I could die for the smoothies and my body feels rejuvenated after the stay in Lulú la Bruja. The staff is always in a good mood creating an atmosphere to simply feel welcome and comfortable. All together I can highly recommend this Bed and Breakfast ,50,789
"The food at the restaurant of Posada Lulu (and their smoothies) ,is exceptionally good, also the atmosphere is great, very relaxing.   The rest of the posada could use a little make over, it is indeed rustic and a, bit chaotic. The place has a lot of potential, though.  Onsite they also offer kayak rental and yoga classes, though you have to pay for everything extra.  I did a yoga class, which I can really recommend. It also comes with a view on the lagoon :)",40,789
"The view at this hostel is amazing, but so are the views all around the lake. The common area at the lake is pretty relaxed and nice, but a bit old.   We had a three person room with a private bathroom. The bathroom was down the hall, the toilet could only flush once every two hours and there was barely any water coming out of the shower. The little mat in front of the shower was old and dirty.   The room was very poorly lit, the airconditioning did not work and the third person had to sleep on a mattress on some boards on the floor, not even a real bed. It was also terribly difficult to keep the cats out of or room and off of our bed.   Breakfast was fine, though small. They say you can order food until 4pm, which is not true. We walked to the restaurant, obviously passed the",10,789
 girl at reception and told her we were hungry. Waited for 15 minutes in the restaurant until the reception girl came and told us the chef or whatever was not there so there was no lunch. It feels like the employees were busier enjoying the lake and each other than actually working...,10,789
…,50,789
"Very small room with no equipments, noisy environment, the bar is closed at 16h and the staff does not offer a glass of water at arrival... a very bad experience with a significant price. A real disaster. Much better offer in Bacalar, which remais a great place to visit.",30,789
"The breakfast was amazing - perfect upon my gusto - overnight oats with lots of seeds topped with fruits, cacao nibs and amaranth puffs wow! For ""lunch"" I had the cacao smoothie!! Simply amazing - it's almost an ice cream - so I spooned the cacao wonder. It was nice to stay there over night, just really hot inside the rooms.",30,789
"We stayed at Posada Lulu for three nights in December of 2018, and felt kind of tricked. There are beautiful photos online, but no mention on the website or after booking to say that the area in front of the water and around the hostel is undergoing major construction.   This means from 10 am - 5 pm every day, we listened to shrieking bandsaws and loud hammering rather than the waves of the lake - not exactly the tranquility we were looking for. It was nice to sit by the water but the area itself was also smaller than it appears online. We stayed in one of the bungalows and left with many bug bites - par for the course in the area maybe.   Some staff were nice but we were confused when the manager refused our request for clean towels after we had been using the same ones for",30,789
" three days.   Positives: the food at the resturaunt was good and the staff there were friendly. The tranquility of the lake when there was no construction, and the French couple working there were very very friendly and lovely! However, we still left feeling tricked by false advertising. Perhaps a reduced rate during construction or at least a warning upon booking would be more fair.",30,789

"I stayed at this hotel for two nights in August 2017 as part of a group tour. I stayed in a double room. The room was spacious and the AC worked well. There was no WiFi in the room, but spotty coverage was available in the lobby/common areas. The pipes in the bathroom emitted a strong sulfur-like/sewage smell. When I informed the front desk, they said they would take care of it--when I came back to the room later, it smelled very strongly of a chemical disinfectant which they had poured down the drains to cover up the smell. It had worn off by the second night there, and the sulfur-like/sewage smell came back. Additionally, the location was also not terribly convenient--it was about a 15 minute walk to the closest public beach access, and a 25-30 minute walk to the downtown area",20,790
" where the fort, ATM, and restaurants are located. Overall, I would not recommend staying in this hotel if you can find availability elsewhere.",20,790
…,50,790
The room was clean and nice. The peice is ok to the place.. But the wifi was terrible! It didn't work most of the time.. The location wasnt really good as well. It's not that's close to the center and not so close to the lack. So we always needed a taxi. When we asked the guy from the front dask to order as he send us to look one in the streets! The stuff wasnt nice at all and didn't gave us mach information when we ask.. Actually they send us to really lame places..,40,790
"My husband & I ended up in Bacalar for an evening...not planned.  We drove around and looked for a place to lay our heads.  We checked out about 7 places; cabanas, tents, hotels and felt they were overpriced or dirty.  We finally spotted an orange 2 story building and stopped.  After asking prices and showing us a room, we booked ourselves in.  What a lovely hotel for 2 nights.  Super economical, clean and very helpful staff.  The rooms are small but well appointed and there is a nice open lounge where you can sit and relax. Very quiet area so sleep was great! Good Wifi AND HOT WATER in the showers!  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone passing through or even staying for an longer period of time.",50,790
"Perfect location, Awesome staff, clean comfortable rooms and lounge area! Free coffee,  croissants and fruit in the morning! Kayak rental was cheaper than at the lake!Cannot say enough good things about this place! Will be returning next year!!",50,791
Check in was quick. Room was very spacious but basic. Complimentary shampoo and soap. Coffee and tea available all day with fruits in the morning. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Took a lagoon tour through the hotel at a very reasonable price. Nice relaxation area. Awesome mural .... 8 rooms each depicted with a character ... try and spot which one is missing!,50,791
"Location is great, 5 min walk to the lake shores, for boat trip or a walk on the promenade, lots of bar, restaurants and shops nearby, the town's square and the fort, the room is clean, comes with free parking and wifi, Ricardo and his staff are very helpful and friendly, would stay again if back to Bacalar",40,791
"Appreciated the common refrigerator & ability to wash out clothes & dry them on their clothesline.  Rooms are clean & AC is good.  1st night was terrible in a room in the back as there is a rooster closeby who starts his day at 2am.  Moved to a room in the front which was quiet but had no wifi.  Desk staff was so unhelpful when we asked info about buses because we had no wifi to check schedules.  Breakfast is coffee, bread & fruit.",30,791
"Glad we found this place and we will be back!  We had booked an airbnb that we were not happy with.  We went for breakfast after one night at the airbnb to regroup and revise our travel plans. We walked around the main plaza and visited the info center there to ask about nearby hotels. While Hotel Szapot was not suggested, it was just around the corner from one that was and the price was better.  It is just one block from the Zocalo and was very comfortable.  The beds were good, and everything worked including the very cold AC!  The wifi is my main complaint.  It was very spotty, though I managed to get some much needed work done. It would be good if they could boost the signal and/or boost the speed of their connection for wifi.",40,791
"This hotel have an excellent location! You can easily walk from the hotel to visit the city. It is even close to the ADO bus station(10-15 mins walk). There is many restaurants around the hotel. The hotel is also very clean (the room and the courtyard). During the night, we heard nothing, it was quiet. They offer coffee all day long, but our first feeling was that the coffe wasn't fresh, so we don't tasted it.. The receptionist spoke only spanish (but they answered in english at my email, so someone speak english in the staff ;)",40,791
The place is located in the center of everything within a walking distance to the lake. The personnel was really friendly and helpful. The rooms are modest but clean and comfortable. There is a roster in the morning singing.,50,791
We had a great stay at Szapot. The room was clean and spacious and the hotel lays just one block away from the central square. The staff helped us with figuring out the bus connections and we were able to check out later. Very much value for our money!,50,791
Private access to the lake Only 3 rooms Very friendly service Offering coffee and tea  Beautiful setting. You will have a quiet private access the whole day. Unforgettable   A really hidden gem And great price  Go for it!!!,50,792
Gracias a todo el equipo del Che en especial a Mati por la buena onda el buen trato y toda la experiencia en sí ! Todos los dias fueron muy divertidos y bonitos! Me llevo un buen recuerdo! Sin duda lo recomiendo para proximos viajeros que quieran una estancia agradable y activa! ,50,793
"-Good location. Walking distance to the lake, restaurants and bars.  -10% off at Mestizos restaurant -downstairs- -rooms comfortable, nice bed and pillows, coffee maker.  -balcony in Jr suites.  -it’s very nice to listen to all those birds at the park in front of the hotel at sunrise and in the morning drinking your coffee.  -Is a small hotel(boutique), there is not pool..affordable.  -Staff have a great customer service. If you need something extra in your room just ask them.  -there is a pharmacy and a sixt store within a block where you can get anything you are missing. -walking-   -Due to COVID everything is kinda slow but the city is beautiful and it’s work the driving.  -DO NOT GO ON WEDNESDAY- the lake doesn’t allow boat on Wednesday for self preservation- -AC/fan/TV",40,794

"***BE WARNED*** THIS HOTEL IS NOT AS ADVERTISED AND IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MUCH BETTER OPTIONS IN BACALAR.   The photos suggest it by the lake, it is not. Then if you look on the website it says ""100 meters away from the Bacalar Lagoon"", it's actually a 10min walk to the nearest entrance to the lake.   You can't even view the lake from the hotel as other hotels are in the way. There is no pool either.   It is far more expensive than much better options on the lake, you're wasting your money and time if you stay here.   DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID OF BOOKING THIS HOTEL!",10,795
"This hotel looks like in front of lake when I check the photos but it is not. Front office clerk doesn’t speak English. Location is bad, it’s so close to highway and you can see all cars going. There are lots of hotels for the cheapest price in the center cause it’s super expensive when you compare what you have at the hotel. Even there is no water in the room and you have to go back to lobby to refill your water bottle. Also dogs can wake you up around like 4 am they are all barking in the hotel hallway.   The last thing if you wanna pay with credit card they charge %4 commission of the room rate. And I was overcharged. I do not recommend this hotel.",10,795
"Bacalar is beautiful  We spent one week there with our baby girl. A week there felt quite long. It was thunder season so the lacuna was not very nice, more moddie:) a lot of mennonites to see there. They live close by. Quiet village !   We loved the apartment. Especially the service. We had water that the staff refilled every 2 days, cleaning whenever we wanted the apartment to be cleaned. They were really warming  It was our daughters first birthday and the staff decorated our apartment for our girl  thanks again  The neighbors dog was a bit annoying  but just because of our baby when she needed to sleep during the day :) I bet the apartment has seen better days. It’s a bit old but there was everything we needed  Highly recommend",30,796
"Bacalar was possibly my favourite place we visited and pleased we chose this hotel. We booked a private room with shared bathroom and were pleased to find we had a large room on the ground floor of the hotel. The shared bathroom was fine and never had an issue of waiting to be able to use.  We never did get to use the included breakfast, we made it upstairs in time on our first day but couldn't understand the set up as nothing was out and no staff in sight to speak to; perhaps something which needs to be better explained at check in?  The desk were able to help with our onwards travel and cost no more than us arranging ourselves so was happy to be able to arrange with them.  Would stay again all in all! ",40,796
"I was happy with this hotel, for the price and the location it was great. It is not perfect , but for me was great , I will stay in this hotel again. For solo travelers it is nice because it is in front of the plaza and they have a small fair every night",40,796
"I do not recommend this hostal/hotel.  This hostal does not announce clear enough that you should expect a shared bathroom. They also have one of the hardest beds I have ever tried to sleep in. Felt like I was lying on asphalt with springs trying to pierce my body.  +Helpful staff. +Right in the center of Bacalar. +Access to kitchen.  -Shared bathroom with 3 other rooms. -Really hard beds.  -Noisy. You will hear the bar/restaurant below and above all night, as well as when other guests are entering their rooms and the shared bathroom. -Breakfast is included but its pretty bad. Buy your own eggs and cook your own breakfast is my advice.",10,796
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The location is so central and the room we stayed at was very pleasant. Great value for money and a great base to explore the lagoon! Very friendly receptionist and staff too.,50,796
"We were dubious because of the name and it being a hostal, but we got a villa which was spacious and clean, had a large fridge and full kitchen. The bathroom was very nice, not great water pressure though. It’s location is unbeatable, though not on the water, it’s a short walk to various docks. The reception staff was above and beyond accommodating and friendly. They helped us print boarding passes, schedule a sailboat tour, find kayaks and call taxis. The air conditioning worked fine, and the suite called “delfines” had  a nice flow of air through it in the evenings. Plus the terrace and restaurant and nice and have pleasant service and delicious food. This establishment definitely added to our trip and I would seriously consider booking here again with my whole family.",50,796
"I booked 7 nights here through booking.com The cost was shown as 379€. I immediately started to get emails from them demanding 50% deposit via Paypal. I voiced my concerns with them about this and after much correspondence, agreed to pay 100€ deposit and the rest on arrival. I then get a request for a payment of almost 240€ through paypal from them! They said they would only accept 50% up front... I asked how they'd managed to add 100€ to the bill and they said it was 19% of the original fee on top... which still doesn't add up... They also said they were going to charge me a further 5.5% for the pleasure of paying by Paypal... This is the only payments they will take! Unbelievable! So the booking fee went from 379€ to almost 500€ in the space of a couple of emails.  At this",10,796
 point I told them to cancel the booking... I hate dishonesty and would be constantly worried about how else they might rip me off if I'd stayed there.,10,796
…,50,796
Room smelled too the point I woke up twice from the smell on the middle of the night.  No pressure in the shower. Water was hot then cold then hot again then cold again. Charged me 16$ over my reservation quote.  Would not take credit cards probably so you can't request a refund.  And finally for what we paid it was a terrible value.  This was Cheap hotel room with the price of a boutique hotel room.   Avoid this place.,50,796
"Estuve alojada 1 noche y lo elegi por el precio y la ubicación. Tiene mulle sobre la laguna, aunq está muy ocupado con lanchas con las que salen las excursiones. No ofrece desayuno, pero tiene un quiosquito para nada caro y tiene un bar.  La cabaña es muy muy básica y habia cucarachas. Pero está muy bien ubicada como para ir al centrito/plaza, donde está el fuerte, los barcitos/restó y negocios para salir. Enfrente mismo hay un comedor y un quiosco.",30,797

"Mi amiga Romina y yo buscábamos un lugar tranquilo donde comenzar a disfrutar de nuestras vacaciones en la península de Yucatán y fuimos a parar al Cayuco Maya en nuestros primeros días, siguiendo la recomendación de un amigo mejocano por su buena relación entre calidad y precio.   El Cayuco está situado a unos 15 minutos en coche del pueblo llamado Bacalar, en un precioso paraje entre la selva y la laguna que recibe el mismo nombre. Hemos pasado unos días estupendos allí, donde hemos tenido la suerte de conocer a Miguel (su propietario), además de a sus hijos y a algunos amigos, quienes nos han tratado con una enorme amabilidad.   El precio de la cabaña (hay cabañas de varios tipos y precios) incluye un delicioso desayuno y, además, hay un restaurante para aquellos que no",50,799

Recomendamos muchísimo este lugar a aquellas personas que busquen una experiencia única, rodeados de bonitos paisajes y bellas personas.",50,799

"Un lugar muy tranquilo, con la ventaja de aceptar perros. Nos quedamos en un domo geodésico que se ve muy padre y moderno, aunque la decoración y detalles por dentro son muy rústicos (no del modo bonito) y hasta con acabados mal hechos; lo bueno es que tiene baño privado y aire acondicionado, y el precio fue muy razonable. Incluyeron desayuno (casero, riquísimo y hecho al momento) y el uso de kayaks. La carta de comida sí es algo limitada pero el sazón es buenísimo y los precios económicos. La atención muy buena, todos muy cálidos y amables. Hay que entender que el concepto es rústico, de campo y para conectar con la naturaleza, no esperen lujos y comodidades de hotel cuando lo que rentas son cabañas. Definitivamente recomendable para parejas y familias. ",20,799
"Fuimos con mis dos perritos a este hotel y es un lugar muy tranquilo. Aceptan mascotas lo cual es un completo plus para el lugar, no está cerca del pueblo lo cual lo hace más privado, tiene su restaurante para desayuno y almuerzo y es hermoso. Miguel nos recibió en la noche y durante el día. En el lugar ofrecen kayaks incluidos en el precio, temazcal y paseo al atardecer con costo extra. Los.precios son razonables y hay opciones de cuartos con baño compartido y frente ala laguna. Amo este lugar y será mi lugar en cada visita a bacalar. Gracias por todo.",10,799
"El lugar es muy bonito y tranquilo. Sin embargo,  la habitación era espantosa,  con mucha humedad en las paredes y el baño intocable.  Lastima,  porque el lugar vale la pena.  La comida es buena aunque el menú sumamente limitado.  Te atienden de medio mala gana y no limpian la habitación ni un solo día.  ",40,799
"Hicimos una reservación directamente con ellos desde el miércoles pasado. Cuando llegamos ahí el lugar estaba muy bien, algo rústico ya que la cocina es a la leña y cacharros de barro.  Al principio me preocupe por qué no nos tomaron ni la temperatura, o gel. Por lo que mi familia iba preparada con todo el kit u siempre cuidando la sana distancia.  Cuando hicimos check in. Nos enseñaron la habitación y por comodidad les preguntamos si había alguna otra opción para estar más cómodos y nos comentaron de un bungalow que estaba disponible y lo pagamos, pero que tendríamos que esperar un poco más en lo que lo limpiaban, por lo que decidimos comer.  El menú fue muy limitado debido a que argumentaban que no tenían más. Pero no hubo inconveniente nos acomodamos. Pero a la mitad de la",10,799
" comida llegó una empleada y nos dijo que no nos iba a dar el bungalow que ya habíamos pagado, por qué llegó una reserva de último minuto.  La verdad fue una falta de respeto que a la mitad de la comida nos fueran a interrumpir. Le contestamos que pues ya estaba pagado y que eso nos habían ofrecido. Solo argumento. Pues les regreso su dinero.  De toda la experiencia que iba bien, por qué ya aparte estábamos consumiendo bien, éramos nueve personas respetando todas las normas para que solo nos dijeran eso.  Lastima del lugar por qué la administración fue muy mala. Yo trabajo en el servicio de hospitalidad y nunca se debe tratar a un huésped así, al contrario es darle opciones por qué también los que llegaron de último minuto no tenían la culpa.  Solo se que tuvimos que buscar un lugar de último minuto, por qué a pese que tuvieron varios limitantes y áreas de oportunidad fuimos pacientes. Pero que nos quitarán nuestra reserva para darla de último minuto a otra si fue pésimo.",50,799
"The rooms are ok. They are clean but the things are old. The shower is terrible. The garden is nice, pool is clean. It's close to the beach (if you have a car) they also have a private parking lot. They offered Breakfast but the service is soooo bad, we woke up at 9 am for breakfast and they didn't  even have coffee when we got to the dinning area. When we ask the lady for coffees she gave us a bad look. If you have a big group you're probably are gonna wait hours for your breakfast. Definitely they need to improve the service.",30,800
"We stayed for 1 night in July 2016. We ended up in the suite because it was all that was showing on booking.com, but when we arrived the hotel was completely empty. This was annoying as we were paying a more expensive price.   The hotel is on the opposite side of the highway to the lake and town so you need a car.   The hotel was not quiet in the evening, there was some sort of music banging until the early hours.   The suite was very nice, it was large, clean, there was hot and cold water and a spa bath. There was a fridge and a microwave so not really possible to prepare your own food. There is no breakfast offered.   The gardens are very pretty.   We had to wait an extra 2 hours to get into the room as it was being cleaned after some sort of big group had rented the whole",30,800

Even when the pool had been cleaned it was still dirty to we got out almost as soon as we got in.   Wifi was good.

"This should be a quiet, charming garden oasis. It isn't. We had the King bungalow with spa bath for three nights. First night, no hot water. Never enough water pressure to use the spa, anyway. Paying extra for the bungalow was a waste of money. The bungalow smelled terribly musty with mildew on the lower walls. Maid service was almost non-existent. I finally had to go to reception and ask for our room to be cleaned on the third day. The maid replaced the towels and made the bed without changing the sheets. Thank god we were leaving the next day. There is no restaurant in the hotel (judging by the cleanliness of the 'shared kitchen' probably a good thing) and the nearest is not within comfortable walking distance.  The pool was not kept clean enough and had a slippery, dangerous",40,800
"Wir haben 1 Nacht im Poza Clara verbracht. Wir haben ein Apartment bekommen mit einer kleinen Küche. Das Zimmer war sauber und das Personal freundlich. Das Frühstück bestand aus Kaffee, Früchten, Saft und wahlweise einer frisch gebackenen Zimtschnecke oder Muffin. Das beste Gebäck, was wir in Mexiko hatten.",40,801
"Poza Clara is a beautiful small hotel perfectly located in Bacalar with only a few blocks from the main square and a couple of blocks to the lagoon. The rooms are beautiful and very clean and the surroundings of the hotel has lots of greenery which created a very calm feeling. When we stayed there were only one other couple except us at the hotel so we had the pool to ourselves and it felt very private and intimate. We would definitely go and stay there again if we go back to Bacalar.We have an 8 month old baby and it was the perfect place to stay with a small baby.The staff were exceptional at Poza Clara with Roger, Misael, Florencio and Shover in the reception; Nelly and Perla in the kitchen; Nere who’s taking care of the rooms and last but not least Juan and his wife who owns",50,801
 the hotel showed us great hospitality. I only have good things to say about Poza Clara!,50,801
"Bacalar scheint eine aufstrebende Stadt zu sein: überall wird für den Tourismus gebaut. Das Hotel ist fertig, liegt aber aktuell noch in einem Baugebiet, das den Gesamteindruck des Hotels leider trübt. Hinter dem Pool (den man nun benutzen kann) hängen schwarze Plastikplanen zum Nachbargrundstück.  Das Zimmer #1 war sauber und klein. Die Klimaanlage war kräftig, wurde aber tagsüber von den Reinigungskräften ausgeschaltet. Ärgerlich ;-)  Zu den Restaurants und den „Highlights“ der Stadt konnte man gut zu Fuß kommen. Das Essen im Restaurant (wir haben nur das Frühstück probiert) war abwechslungsreich, authentisch und lecker (aber auch scharf!). Für einen Tagesausflug nach Kalakmul mussten wir vor den Frühstückszeiten losfahren; wir haben für die Fahrt ein Früchtemüsli im doggy bag",40,802

I gave two stars instead of one because we were happy we could stay here for one night with a super late arrival. But this place is so new there is nothing around. Its more like a motel... breakfast is horrible: toast and butter and jam. COME ON!  The rooms are really small and pretend to be in Scandinavia but it’s really not working. Stay closer to town or the Laguna; as we did the other nights we were in Bacalar. It’s better and cheaper. ,20,803
"This might seem as a harsh review, but this is as honest and objective as can be. On pictures this place looks lovely, but that’s not case. The rooms are incredibly small, absolutely no space for 2 people. I have not even seen rooms in the center of Amsterdam or London this small. This is my 9th hotel travelling through mexico and I am already used to the fact that the Mexican hotels cannot be compared with the European standard, but this is bad even for Mexican standards. Drywall walls, so you can hear every word the neighbours are saying from rooms left, right and above, you can even hear them going to the toilet. No storage space, sink is in the bedroom, a big window with a fully light-transmitting curtain, so you are wide awake at 6 AM. The bed is exactly between 2 walls, so",10,803
" you have to climb over each other if you have to use the toilet. The shower really has no water pressure, which is not always good throughout Mexico, but I have never experienced the water pressure this bad, not even in Asia. Also the worst wifi we had in all Mexico. Plus no good areas to sit outside, uncomfortable wooden chairs, and half the place is still under construction. A lot of stray dogs and cats all over the property, also barking and whining all night long. Breakfast is a couple of days old toasted bread and jam. The bar only sells regular coke or water. Staff does not speak english at all. I travel a lot, about 3 months a year, mostly to remote places and back to basics, but still this is definitely top 5 worst stays over the last 10 years.  A waist of money and time.",50,803

"This hotel was perfect for our stay in Bacalar - clean, fresh and a great quiet atmosphere. The pool was amazing and we swam until 8pm most nights. Rooms are cleaned daily and are generous size and very very comfortable. Couldn’t ask for anything more. We loved our stay and would highly recommend. ",40,803
"There was a mix up with my reservation and the owner was outrageously rude and aggressive. I used booking.com to make a reservation. When I tried to pay I was told that I should pay at the hotel. I arrived at the hotel and at reception was a very nice woman who spoke NO English. I tried to pay but was told that the internet was down. She showed me to my room. I made the assumption I would pay when the internet was working. I went to bed around 1 a.m. Shortly after someone knocks on my door. I opened it and there were three men staring at me. The owner (I assume) then flies into a tirade about how I had not paid and that I wasn’t registered. EXTREMELY RUDE. EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE. Rather than, like a normal person, assume that there must have been a mix up of some sort because your",10,804
" average American tourist doesn’t go to Mexico to squat in mediocre hotel rooms in iffy locations, this man just became more aggressive and used no reason. There really is no need to give more details. Just avoid this place.

The location is ok, but still not far from the city center or the lagoon. But it's the service that stands out. Living here is like having a family (or good friends) in Bacalar. Can truly recommend this place and I hope to be back someday.",40,804
"This hotel, although modern in design and comfortable beds, had totally filthy cement floors throughout the room, complete with spilled food stains and random hair.  The steps etc were also very dirty.  It needed a total hose down. We did our best to mop ourselves and wore our flip flops inside.  We have stayed on a lot of hotels in this $ range this trip but all were clean.  I mentioned it, kindly, to housekeeping the next day and she improved it slightly.  Horrible.  I don't recommend.",50,804
"We arrived pretty late and left really early 5:30am and in both times la señora Ofelia was really sweet and attentive to wait for us to open the door. It’s a humble little hotel, it’s not a luxurios place but that’s exacty what it is being offered and the price is accordingly cheap. There are 3 really cute and friendly dogs that greet you when you arrive. For the price we paid, excellent service. Very much worth it if you are looking to save some money on your trip",50,805
"Casa posada was great.  The staff is very kind and accommodating. (You just have to be patient.  Enjoy meeting people.)  You have the choice using a bed and adding a hammock inside the room for a few more bucks.  The location is simply four blocks away from the main plaza.  It is quiet and away from most of the noise.  I even enjoyed listening to all the birds in the peaceful early morning.  There's free coffee in the reception.  Parking was free, safe and secure inside the hotel.  We decided to walk everywhere in Bacalar.  There's no need to drive around if you are in reasonable good health and fit.

We used the bicycles one day to explore Bacalar, though Casa Madrid is close enough to walk to everything.  The hostess/owner was so very kind and thoughtful. We enjoyed our stay very much and even extended it.  This is not a fancy waterfront hotel, but those charge at least twice the rate as Casa Madrid.  Before staying here we stayed at 2 other hotels in the same price range.  Casa Madrid was far superior.",40,805
"The rooms have a very old smell. There also is no airconditioning so please take that into account. The personel also does not speak any English, and they make you charge quite a lot for very small things (like instant coffee). Furthermore, the WiFi signal is very poor. For what its worth, the place is quite cheap and if you do not mind walking 10 minutes to the city centre, you´re good.",40,805

"Being on a budget and without a car, I needed a reasonable place to stay and near town and the restaurants; Posada Casa Madrid was perfect. It was close to the bus terminal and 5 minutes walk to the center of town. The room is simple but nice and I loved the fact that they cleaned my room EVERY DAY! I loved coming back after a day of swimming to find clean, white sheets on my bed. Bacalar is such a wonderful place!",30,805
"Stayed here for two nights and I am a little confused by the negative reviews, the owner was charming and spoke good english. There is definitely aircon that can get as cold as you want. I felt like I was back in England!   I was staying with a friend and we had a room with two double beds, it was big with a decent enough shower with hot water.   It is only a 5 minute walk to the main square and a 10 minute walk to the laguna. There are bikes also available for hire for a reasonable fee if you dont want to walk. ",50,805

The WC supposed to be private, but it was also used by other people, I suspect, and it didn’t get cleaned everyday :-(.  The personnel attention is below the standard.  I cannot give an opinion about the food, we did not eat there.

So i talked to my family and decide not to stay for all that and because is very far away from down town. we drove out of the place and there was a gate closed, so we started talking to some local people there and they told me, this guy do this all the time to the travelers all the time, i did not believe it yet till i ask one of the staff to open the gate, well the owner of the place came and park his card infront of ours and asked us if we want to stay, we said no, they he was, well",50,809

Well we were waiting for some one to come to the gate, one of their customers was locked out of the gate, he drop to down town and when we drop back, the gate was locked and had to get out of his card and walked all the way down to asked them to open the gate, so in general, is a horrible place.

"This is not a hotel, more like a glorified hostel.There is very little privacy and the rooms are tiny, which would be fine if there was a nice outdoor space but that is not the case. There is no shade and the yard has only a small plastic pool that is very slippery and three hammocks which are ripped and mildewed and just gross. Its obvious that this is merely a money making operation as the owners seem to do the bare minimum. Half of the rooms are under construction and it seems that they could care less about hospitality. I never thought it would be difficult to properly vent a toilet, have a toilet seat that actually fits or screens that lack huge gaps but it seems that I was wrong. I loved Bacalar but this was the worst place that we stayed in Mexico.",20,811

"After a last minute cancellation, we needed a place to stay and very few places were available. I was reluctant to stay at Casa Delia given reviews I’ve read but was pleasantly surprised. The room itself was small but clean, comfortable and well decorated.  The aircon worked well and it was quiet enough to sleep. The towels did have stains and holes.    The location is a bit of walk from the main town but most places in Bacalar are. ",40,811

Or, les occupants des chambres, français, nous ont expliqué qu’ils étaient arrivés sans réservation dans matinée et que l’établissement leur a demandé de payer en cash... Très sympathique, ils nous ont fait visiter, les chambres sont mieux en photo, le bâtiment est vieillissant... Nous avons finalement trouvé un autre hôtel à la hâte sous le déluge de la queue de l’ouragan Grace, une expérience très désagréable!!",10,812

Su personal es muy amable, también tienen un bar con mixología de autor y platillos árabes, haciéndote sentir en otro lugar completamente.  Definitivamente recomiendo este lugar para vacacionar, tiene tours, comida, alcohol y está cerca del centro, aunque tiene todo para no tener que salir del hotel.",50,812
"Hôtel très bien situé, chambre très propre, literie et serviettes impeccables. Les chambres sont des répliques de petites maisons maya, douche à ciel ouvert. Le personnel de l’hôtel est vraiment sympathique et serviable (Zindel en particulier). Elle m’a aidé à organiser une sortie en voilier avec un super Capitaine que je recommande à tout le monde. Le wifi fonctionne très bien dans les chambres. La nuit on peut entendre de la musique qui provient du bar en arrière mais pour ma part cela n’a pas été un problème du tout. Si jamais l’eau chaude manque juste à le signaler à la réception qui pourra s’occuper du problème. J’ai passé 4 nuits à cet hôtel, j’ai adoré l’hôtel et j’y retournerais demain matin. Pour un hôtel typique avec un bon rapport qualité/prix je recommande!!!",50,813

"We wanted to treat ourselves to a bit more luxery than we're used to. We've never had such a bad place. And we're used to sleeping on the floor in a jungle. Everything they claim on booking. Com, the moment you pay, you get a short email saying all that isn't true and isn't gonna happen. So no warm water, no towels. Fine but then don't promise anything. Upon arrivel we were early, so I asked if we could just sit in the communal area until our room is ready. nop. I never paid so much for a place, and I've never ever got kicked out on the street before. Super unfriendly staff. Toilet paper bin hasn't been changed in the 4 days that we're here. Shower doesn't work. When I asked one of the two girls came and help. But clearly I was bothering her. You have to pay for hot water. With",10,814
" a big sign next to it, guilt ripping you to use less water for the environment (that is WY they make you pay BS), while they have the sprinklers on from 9am till 7pm. Grass is drowning. Hammocks are in a guard sock thing to not get leaves on them? I asked about it. They told me to put the hammock protection back on after I'm done using it. (super inviting, right). The next day they just took all the hammocks away. Kitchen is smaller than the tents and you can only use 1 fire at the time. So cooking takes hours, imagine multiple people. This place is a joke. Sad thing is that it was build with so much potential. It is a gorgeous place but completely soulless. If somebody would actually want to make this an inviting place and just be nice and welcoming this would be a paradise place. Counting the days to leave.",10,814

I was charged $248 USD for a service I won’t be using and the management practice here is nothing short of robbery. They charged my credit card IMMEDIATELY on booking.com rather than paying upon arrival. I always pay in the national currency at the time of arrival with booking.com. alAdditionally, I requested the cancelation within 15 minutes of the transaction upon finding out that there was no hot water nor towels.

I’ve communicated with the company several times with zero understanding- when I wrote to the company for the nth time, expressing how I’m short on funds and a teacher, I received an insulting response, questioning my intelligence.

"Won't go there ever. The room was rather small for a 3-guest room. Was not possible to fit in the bathroom unless the door was closed (small like a closet,  2m² max), and you couldn't even open the door entirely because the toilets were on the way. Worse, the french window couldn't be locked ! The room was on the ground floor, so basicly, anyone could enter the room.  Fan was not working properly.  There was no blanket, although it was cold at night and the staff would try to find a solution.  We were supposed to have a room with a view on the laguna, we got a view on the garden....  The only good thing here is the laguna and the private small dock but I strongly recommend go to another place which is on the laguna and you will definitely get something better for the same price",10,816

"Biggest nightmare and something you don't éver want to deal with on a vacation. My biggest mistake is also booking via Agoda who books through Booking.com (which I was not aware of till this incident happened) On Agoda it has 9.6 rating that's why I chose this particular hotel. I booked 3 nights and we had a long journey getting to Bacalar. We were super tired by the time we arrived. When we walked up to the front desk, I had an instinct this place is not what the pictures had shown so I asked to check for the room we booked. The unit we booked was right next to the reception area and the room looked unclean and we brought up a security issue if the floor to ceiling windows which can't be locked how easy for theft? They showed us another room and it was better than the previous",10,816
" and paid the 3 nights as what we originally planned for. When we were in the room, we noticed there were dead bugs stuck to the bottom frame of the screen protectors of the floor to ceiling glass doors that leads to the balcony. The mosquito screen protectors were broken & we can't leave the sliding doors open for fear of mosquitoes entering the room. For the price we paid $85 per night, we were not entitled to have AC just fan which is fine. But now without fresh air, it is a bit annoying.  This room basically has 2 beds and a broken toilet door that can't shut from the outside, broken screen protectors & an hour after the rain, rotten smell started to come from the bathroom. The bathroom is located right next to one of the beds. It was awful as we can't shut the door, so we complaint about the smell and the receptionist was already expecting that. He said, it is rainy season hence the smell is everywhere. He offered to switch rooms again and let us have our pick as no other guests were in this hotel besides us. By this time, we have no interest in switching to another room but to terminate our stay. We came to agreement we will pay for one night and cancelled the following 2 nights.  For $85 that was a ripped off. They also wanted extra 50 pesos for pillow and 50 for extra towel. This hotel is desperate to make money in every way. No one speaks English and the owners and relatives all hang out at the hotel. They were very unfriendly and so is the receptionist who never greeted us with a smile since we stepped into the place.  Anyways the story did not end with just poor conditions of the room. Finally back and forth with Agoda all night, Agoda had to call Booking.com to get the hotel to agree to refund us remaining 2 nights. The tricky part here is Jesus(front desk) said to process the refund we have to call Booking.com during office hours next day to get the process going. Jesus made it looked like we are getting our refund as he asked for bank info and said that if we give him a Mexican bank account it will take 2 days instead of returning to my bank card(US issued).  So next day we called Booking,com. The staff mentioned to call back in a week as the person in charge is on holidays.  I had to call Agoda back to resolved this and after several back and forth phone calls speaking with different agents, the conclusion is since I paid directly to the hotel(which was the only option I had online via Agoda) I need to deal with hotel directly.   We called the hotel again saying Agoda said Casa Corazon has to refund us since we paid the hotel directly. Jesus now on the phone claiming. ""No Entiendo, No English"" and hung up. My Mexican friend wasn't with me the next day when I did all these calls. Finally I got my Mexican friend to call, Jesus said I booked through Booking.com I have to deal with them. So before we left, he had a different story.  Lesson learnt, if you booked via Agoda or Booking.com and the option ""pay directly at hotel"", please be aware none of these booking agencies will take responsibilities and the best part of all this mess for days now, Booking.com finally replied we will take a commission of $30 from $170 and it will take up to 30 days. Basically I will be out of Mexico in a week and I don't think they will ever refund. This hotel is a joke. Don't ruin your vacation staying here. And if you have an option to book via Airbnb, please take that option. Airbnb has never let down whatever the situation was. In this case, Airbnb would have given me a voucher for next stay and void the entire stay given enough evidence. I have pictures of the bathroom door and broken screens.  If you in Bacalar, walk down the street by the lagoon, hotels and hostels are all next to one another and not all are listed online. And you can choose a place with better lagoon views as well. We did and it was 65$ per night with AC, views, free bikes and kayak.  ",30,816

Our room and bathroom were dirty, the door of the bathroom didn’t close, the fan made a buzzing sound, mattress and pillows were uncomfortable and the room’s doorlock was jammed so at times it wouldn’t lock properly. On top of that the receptionist was unfriendly and didn’t care about the issues I reported. The pier is nice, good hammocks and chairs with amazing view.

He said it is possible we just had to cancel the booking of your internetplatform and pay in cash. He promised that we wouldn’t pay twice. After a few days we were charged at our creditcard for the three nights we initially booked. It took over 3 weeks and many messages to get parts of the money back. Only one guy speaks English at this hotel. So it is very difficult to communicate and you always have to use google translator, if you cannot speak Spanish. Be careful of booking this location. The hotel itself is ok, but you need a car, because it is not very close to the center.",10,818

I travelled with a girlfriend so we naturally hug the edge of the bed when we have to share, but in this bed, we were still crashing into each other.

They are simply uncapable (kitchen is really unacceptable), unwilling (nobody speaks 1 word of English, but even using our Spanish-Italian they neither try) and some even impolite (reception lady should simply not work in contact with normal human being)  Coming to the place itself common spaces are fine and some rooms even beautiful, but this was  not the case of our Family room... which was quite standard with a not well cleaned bathroom.

I put very good but it’s good and above average.  The breakfast that was included was good.  Ask for a room on lower floor as the top is a palapa.

We had to guess what they had to offer.  Fruit was offered at breakfast only.  Period.  The food!  Microwave food.  We ordered eggs and sausage....we got hot dogs for sausage.  A bacon cheeseburger was served with a piece of meat...microwaved...and a piece of Jamon....sandwich ham.  The service was awful!  We had to approach the staff for everything.  They would watch us sitting at the table and ignore us.  We had to call them over.  Finally I just walked up to them with my order every time I wanted anything.  Waste of money.  It's a beautiful place but they don't have the customer service or good food.  Once you're there you're stuck.  There's nothing around.  Which is why we chose an all inclusive hotel.,10,826

Pier hotel Bacalar todo inluido took money from our creditcard 4 months prior to our trip (By the name of bekehotels.com). We have cancelled our trip three weeks ago and we are still waiting for them to transfer the money back. In fact they don’t respond to any message at all,10,826
"We were very excited to visit Bacalar during our one month stay in Akumal however booking at Hotel pier Bacalar was a nightmare. We traveled for about 3 hours to its location and as we entered the road to enter the hotel, the bumps nearly damaged the under carriage of the car and as we entered the lobby ""which is outdoors"" mosquitos were waiting big time. Before they actually checked us in, I asked if we could see the property / room. The room was disgusting, curtains dirty, stained..smelled terrible etc. So I told the front desk that I do not want to stay in such filth and requested a cancelation. They told me ok, you can cancel but refused to give me my money back although it was listed as free cancellations. So behold, me and my wife turned around and drove 3 hours back to",40,826

"Don't do it to yourself.  While the view was spectacular at Wayak, the service was the worst I've had in Mexico and the sofa bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had the displeasure of lying on (my son slept on the floor).  They had literally 1 and 1/2 oars for the guests to share between six or so kayaks. A/c in room was broken.  The staff were more interested in their mobile phones than the guests, frequently disappeared for long periods, and did not even offer to help carry heavy luggage up stairs.  Check-in was downright rude.  There are many places to stay by the lake in Bacalar.  I strongly suggest trying somewhere else.",20,826
"Because of a huge mixup in our reservation, we had to shove fourteen people in two rooms.  The owner compensated by giving us free dinner and beverages which helped the sting of our reality.  Beautiful quiet and secluded place.  However, one must be very sure-footed when walking anywhere on the property because of the very steep inclines and cobblestone-like walkways.  Rooms were clean but not exactly easy to get to.  In our room, there was a large step up to both the kitchen and bathroom and if you didn’t keep your wits about you, it could be a recipe for disaster.  The food was good and they did offer a menu in English which helped as the staff spoke only Spanish.  All in all, I would probably stay here again because of the exquisite beauty of the property.",50,826

PERDIMOS media hora del amanecer por intentar esperar que saliera más agua(foto con máxima presión lamentable) .

Cependant, les points faibles concernant le logement sont: Forte odeur d'humidité surtout dans la salle de bains, logement bruyant car le chien d'à côté ne cesse d'aboyer, difficile d'avoir de l'eau chaude dans la douche. Logement assez basic. Les espaces communs sont peu confortables et quasi inexistants. Pas de parking pour voitures.",30,829
"After reading other reviews about subpar food, I must say we could not disagree more. The food was excellent. We ordered the ceviche every day. Beautiful resort, tentative staff, clean rooms. Booked a private sail tour of the Lagoon through front desk. Super easy and they pick you up right at the dock. Loved our stay.",50,830
"A chance stop-over in Bacalar ended up with us spending a night at this hotel. The personnel is kind and friendly. And professional, not trying to be your buddies with the tiresome ""amigo"" schtick; no, here they address you by your name.   Antonio deserves a mention for his being so attentive with the food service and manager Carlos is the epitome of laid back and has a calm ""sure, we can do that"" approach."" to whatever request you might have.   Beds are very comfortable and designers - as well as guests who appreciate the details - will love the textures, colors and thought that went into the creation of a welcoming, comfortable and upscale without pretentious kind of space.

"Very lovely hotel.  Build to complement the environment with all natural local materials.  Loved the patio with the hammock.  They have parking right out front, continental breakfast (fruit with yogurt & granola, coffee or tea, toast) you can order eggs or anything else for extra cost which was very good.  Reception & staff all very friendly.  They were always cleaning and maintaining the beautiful gardens, pool and lagoon area.  Very peaceful.  Rooms very spacious & cozy.  Will be back to enjoy this hidden gem.  Only complaint, my room was near the reception area and at 6 am when the staff would start their day they would have music on and yell to each other.  Maybe keep it down to at least 8 am some of us are on vacation and like to sleep in some days.",50,830
"We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Carolina. The staff is so attentive and kind. The front desk was great with recommendations. It is a small boutique hotel which was the perfect authentic feel for the quaint town of Bacalar. It is locally family owned which made us very happy to be supporting. The location of the hotel is ideal, as it is just outside the heart of town. Its a great value and beautiful place.",10,830
"I cannot rave enough about this hotel. It is located in front of the lagoon, with a beautiful view over the peer, kayaks for guest use, bar, small restaurant and only 15 rooms in bungalows. It is pristine, well decorated and perfectly comfortable. But above all the esthetics and comfort what makes Carolina outstanding is the staff, from cooks, waitstaff and cleaning crew. The front desk staff is always ready to help, specially Lorena who will joyfully respond to questions, tailor recommendations keenly understanding the guests’ preferences. She’s a delight! Antonio, Darwin, Mario, Manuel, Marcelino, Alexis, Jordi, and Diego were kind, attentive and made our stay very special. Carlos the property manager was ready to tend to any need. It says a lot about a place when you see",50,830

"The room is clean and the service good. Breakfast can't be called breakfast. Bicycle rentals are expensive, you can get cheaper from your neighbor. The location of the hotel is good, bike hire in Bacalar is the best way to explore the place.",30,831
Beautiful place.  Clean  Fair price  Close to downtown  And they can help you fix tours! Highly recommended  Came for a day only but it would be worth to stay longer  The hotel offers coffe and tea 24 hours. And a continental breakfast from 8 to 10 am,40,831
This little gem we found while wandering around the streets of Bacalar. It is clean and close to the action in Bacalar. A quick stroll of 5 minutes takes you the the lagoon. Free parking behind shut gates and a guard/staff member on duty at night.,40,831
"Shameful hygiene!  Dirty sheets, no pillow cases, toilets and showers not cleaned during our three days of stays.  Even the breakfast is dirty, with flies and hairs in the jam.  The staff is even more deplorable: no smiles during the stay but nervous to the point of yelling at customers when they do not understand a request formulated in English!  For example, they prefer to watch a series on the front desk computer rather than turning on the air conditioning before 10 at night, which makes it impossible to be in the room before that time.  And they are also stingy to the point of tripping the air conditioning every morning at 6 a.m. which makes the rooms stuffy from 7 a.m.  I rarely write comments but this is really unheard of I only mentioned a few things but for example a",10,832

Please note: towels are charged per day and additional costs if you have more than one piece of luggage per person or if you leave your luggage in storage for a few hours after your check out.",40,832

It is really lovely and has a good atmosphere related with nature, I really loved that they did have a/c at the shared room.  The beach club just amazing and so relaxing, I loved being there, next time I come I Will book to stay there.  Just one detail I would love that the staff could answer the phone quickly, I had to call several times to get an answer and unfortunately I had some incovenience with my bed :( when I came back from touristing all day I noticed something white and kinda viscous drop near my pillow.  I spoke with the staff but I didn't get much",10,832

Breakfast is average, the place is nice and the people is really friendly.   The only think that I did not like is that if you are leaving in the evening they charge you 50MXN to keep the luggage",30,832
"-I couldn't book on booking as i usually do, but still could see the price. When i asked, the manager (as friendly as a prison door, as the rest of the staff btw) refused that i pay the booking price, si  i paid more. - The dorm was small for 10, it seems old and it was very cold. - The""continental"" breakfast was very average. Moreover they furnish food just a little at the time, to make sure you don't take too much... - The hostel is still getting built. So it's not really peaceful.  - And last but not least, you have to leave after the chek-out. You can't even wait at the hostel.  So when i wen to take back my backpack, i sat 10 mn because it was still early to catch my bus. A employee asked me to leave, or told me that i would have to pay extra fees if i wanted to stay",10,832
" longer. This is honestly the first time i see this in an hostel, ans i have travelled a lot ! Usually, you can at least wait a few hours if your bus is a bit later, and use the kitchen and the bathroom.

"We stayed at Agave blue for 3 nights and wished it could have been longer. The hospitality we received there was far and above any other accomodation we have stayed in throughout our 10 week trip in Mexico. The lake is absolutely magical and staying lake-side in Bacalar is an absolute must, worth every penny. We had our own private room with a bathroom and fully equipped kitchen, right at the lake front. We thought that staying out of town would hinder us but our wonderful hosts drove us in to town personally on two separate occasions. Thank you infinitely Teresa, Paul and Sebastian for the amazing stay in an amazing spot, I'll certainly spread the word of your slice of heaven!",50,833
"My wife and I stayed for a week at Agave Blue. Teresa, made us feel like family. On our first night she even drove us to town to get groceries and any essential things we needed for our time there. Sebastian (staff member) was also checking on us making sure we were well taken care of. The facilities were clean, the garden is beautiful with a diverse variety of butterflies and birds. The views of the lagoon were to die for. You just walk a few steps and there you are. We hope to return soon.",50,833
"WOW!   What a beautiful place where Mother Nature welcomes you with beauty, greatness and sweetness!  Everything is done so that you spend an unforgettable moment!  4 days is not enough to enjoy the place and soak it like a tattoo on the skin!  The availability and kindness of Teresa and Paul are extraordinary! Many kind attentions during our stay! Thank you Teresa for existing and for making us dream.    Thank you Teresa for having created this paradise yourself and especially for sharing it so generously!  We will come back for sure ;)",50,833
"We, four women traveling together, stayed on the main floor of the casa, an ample, very well furnished space with a view down a slope to the lake.  Teresa was an attentive and gracious hostess who even stocked the kitchen with eggs, bread, milk and butter.  She answered our many questions, giving us many valuable hints for our stay in Bacalar.  We enjoyed the fact that we were not in the heart of the town, and were grateful that we had rented a car, which gave us this freedom.  When we booked a four hour sailboat tour from a marina not far away, they picked us up and dropped us off right in front of the casa.  It would also have been an easy kayak to the lakeside restaurant of Hotel Encantada, also just down the lake.  Heavenly!",50,833
"I spent 12 days here in May 2016, in the bottom floor apartment with a beautiful view of the lagoon and lovely shaded patio. It was an amazing time to rest and relax, with swimming, kayaking, reading in the hammock, napping in lounge chair on patio. It really is perfect. Teresa, the owner, is terrific...so helpful and knowledgeable. I would not change a thing, and will certainly be back!!!",50,833
"Great place for couples or families, Teresa is a great host. We enjoyed so much, was fun and the place very safe for swim and go in the kayaks. It's 10 minutes in car from the town so you feel by yourself lost in paradise.",50,833
"This trip was just one of the greatest with our family!! We where looking for calm and being alone from our busy world and that is exactly what we found in Agave Blue. The residence can accommodate 3 separate families in the same house, all still having independence... The house has its own lake entrance and is literally next to it. The rooms are gorgeous all equipped with the finest details and a great taste of decoration. Theresa the owner is just the sweetest lady!! And we even took Penelope our dog!! Which was a very important factor for us. We really recommend it.",50,833

Great view particularly sunrises.  Owner Teresa is great for all kinds of information, directions, and will pick up guests from the bus or arrange taxis. Morning coffee and pastries were included and guests can also use the main kitchen and refrig.  Kayaks and float tubes are also available.

The owners treat us like family and take care of us, it is quiet and respectful of each other's space, wifi is good, and it's well maintained, a little oasis in a jungle-like space. We canceled our other hotels to stay here longer! The beds are more comfortable than in other luxury hotels also :) It is for sure simple, but everything we needed to feel grounded and happy!",50,834
Fue una gran sorpresa al entrar. En su fachada no aparenta mucho pero adentro es un sitio muy bello y acogedor.

We looked at the room with a quick climpse and paid him for the stay, as we began to settle and have a shower which the hot water turned cold in five minutes, in the bath room ceiling was covered in mold painted over and I started having a respatory responds with my asthma.   After our shower I approached Jonathan about this and he started getting very upset, he mentioned why I didn't look at it first and he opened his home to us after being closed. I express that I have respatory issues with mold and that this wouldn't be a good place for me.

He took us to local places on the lake to experience all there is to offer. Highly recommend the boat tour.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the breakfasts were great also, cereals, toast, beans, jams, yogurt, fruits.  And eggs were 50MX peso more.  We will definitely be back to stay with them. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .",50,835
A friendly homestay in a perfect location on the laguna. The staff were very welcoming and helpful.  We'd strongly recommend Jonathan's boat trip - it was one of the highlights of our whole trip. He helped us visit places around the laguna that few other tours go to. A great stay!,50,835

"My girlfriend and I (Polish and Irish) absolutely loved staying here. Not typical hotel luxury but Jonathan and his family and staff were incredibly welcoming and it felt like we were at a friend’s home (on a magnificent lagoon) which qualifies as luxury for us.   Definitely do the lagoon tour. Jonathan does it for a fitting price, which reduces if you join other guests (and we had a great time with a wonderful family who we joined). He tells you he’ll take you to some quiet spots where the other hotels don’t go and he is not lying. He also completely respects and is proud of the natural environment, ensuring we and other guests did not not mess with the sensitive eco systems... a proper guide, good with families but also good fun for us younger couple too.

Eduardo and all people are so amazing, there where any hotel or b&b is so focussed on service, these guys take it all a step further.   They really go beyond to make you have the best time ever and I highly recommend everyone to go to this beautiful place by the lake during their stay in Bacalar!!! Unfortunately we only booked this accomedation for 1,5 days. During our trip in Mexico we’ve stayed in many hotels and places, but nothing beats this when it comes to the “home coming” feeling!

"We booked 3 nights towards the end of our 3 week trip of the Yucatán Peninsula. We had been traveling doing lots of activities so we just planned on chilling out at the property. We arrived to a major construction project and not at all relaxing. The property said they had to change the septic system to connect to city sewer, they never mentioned it to us, they said they did not have time, however, they contacted us previously and even on arrival day they contacted us and never mentioned construction. The property is only 4 units, so a project of this magnitude affects the entire property. The smell was awful. The staff member that took us to our room mentioned that Bacalar used to be quiet and restful, but he said tourism is increasing and the place is changing, no longer the",10,836
" quiet place is was before. We did witness the tour haggling on the street as we were looking for the property, which does not have any signage, make sure you have actual street address and you will have to have them open a gate for you if you are driving. The night we did stay we heard the neighbor’s dog barking in the night, not too much, but it did wake us up. And on the other side the neighbors run some sort of boat touring business and a couple was drinking and talking loudly in one of the boats until after 11:30 pm, we had to close the balcony doors and turn on the a/c to tune out the noise. We decided we could not bear the construction noise and left, we spent the better part of the next day finding different accommodations, not something we wanted to do, that why we pre plan. We decided to simply extend our stay at our last stop in Tulum, so it really affected our plans to at least check out Bacalar. We definitely feel the Villa should have let us know of the construction and let us choose if we could bear the consequences. Not good ethics in our opinion to not disclose that.",30,836

"The host is very kind and she gave us a good introduction and recomendations for Bacalar. The rooms are new built and very fresh and clean. The breakfast is good; bread, fresh fruits, cornflakes with milk and coffe/tea is included. Some may think it is too far from the center and lagoon, but it is only a 10 min walk. And it is even closer to the ADO Terminal (so you don't need to carry your luggage too far, perfect if you are backpacking). I am so happy with our stay. I recomend this hotel and if I visit Bacalar again I would definitely stay here!",50,837
"We have stayed here for two nights. It was just great. Even though it looks nothing from the outside,once you pass that wooden gate, you start feeling right at home. The rooms are very clean, breakfast was nice as well. Not too expensive. A bit far away from the city center but we had a car so no bother. Free parking available ",50,837
"I was so disappointed! I wanted to love this place. I booked it knowing it was to be en experience. However as soon as we arrived things weren’t quite as nice as they seemed.  I wouldn’t really consider it pet friendly as there isn’t really a place to walk your pets.  They close the gate @ 10. Make sure to walk your pet before then The restaurant was not open, when we arrived so we went elsewhere. When we returned to settle in for the night, I realized there was absolutely NO toilet paper. I went yo the front desk @ 7 pm and everyone was gone.  No TP in public bathrooms either. I wound up stealing  napkins from the restaurant.  I realize the establishment cannot control the outside temp but the fans weren’t nearly sufficient. Unfortunately there isn’t really internet. LTE works",30,838

We had a cabin near the stairs to the dock which had a lovely veranda to sit with friends or just relax in the hammock. Breakfast was included and was better than average with enchiladas one morning and scrambled eggs the next. Unless you need the american style hotels with ac and sophisticated decor, this is the place for you !",50,838

Unfortunately we had neighbours that sounded like they were in last throws of death with extreme coughing through the night and loud discussion of cough afterwards. The other significant mark against is the poor dog left tied to a tree that belongs to the hotel. Left from 3pm on day arrived and still there when leaving. No water, food. Heartbreaking to see. The sound issue could be forgiven if half the price but at cost just made it feel frustrating and poor experience.",40,838
"I booked just one night here for my birthday. The hotel is beautiful and despite the fact that it rained through the whole time I was there it was still fantastic. The staff are fantastic and you can re t a kayak for 200 pesos, which is a good deal. The jetty on the lagoon is great and there are loads of hammocks. The restaurant did great food and even gave me a free dessert for my birthday. Our room was huge and I wish I had time to stay more than one night. There are plenty of places to hide in the rainy season and the water is warm even when the air is cold. I reccomend getting up early and swimming in the lagoon. ",40,838
"The place is rustic with according to the front desk only one room with AC which is the room we got. Rooms are basic but charming. The food at the restaurant was very good, the highlight is the deck over the lagoon and hammocks. Excellent place for a really good rest in a fluff free environment. nice people",50,838
"The place itself is beautiful and right on the water. It's a little outside of town, about 10-15 minutes driving, so you should drive because on a bicycle would be a little tiring.   It's an eco friendly place so they provide soap and shampoo that is better for their water processing, which is cool.   If you're staying in a room with your friend, be aware that the bathrooms are not quite closed off from the room, so they can see you using the toilet and showering, if they look over the half door, which they should not! Rude. Lol  The paddle board rental was MXN$200 for 2 hour usage and the food averaged MXN$120-180 for a meal, which gets charged to the room.  Cute and rustic",50,838
"even though we didn' t get a room since all booked - we came to look at it & were very friendly hosted for a drink, WIFI, look at the place. also a very good energy & very welcoming. we highly recommand the place.",40,838
"Very friendly employees (especially the owner) and nice big absolutely clean room. We stayed one night and would book there definitely again! It's calm and has nice smelling soaps. Thanks a lot for the service. Hope Bacalar doesn't get too quick too touristy and destroyes the beautiful laid back atmosphere and unique nature (like Cancun, Playa and Tulum) because it's a cool town, not many tourists (but there are - of course) and the lagoon is gorgeous. Even though we've heard that this small paradise is started to be exploitated. Sad but true.",50,839
"This is not a large place, but it was so comfortable.  The owner/host is of British and American desent ,and was plesant and went out of way to be of assistance.  The sheets and personal products were higher quality, and the sheets high thread count.  The AC was cold and the shower water was hot   Perfect  more than a great value, it was a pleasure .",40,839
"Highly recommend this small hotel located in a quiet area of Bacalar. The rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained. All rooms seem to have air conditioning and cable tv. The owner is very helpful and speaks both English and Spanish. ",50,839
Super clean room . This small hotel is close to everything located in a quiet secure area . The owners/hosts are a wealth of knowledge about the area and eager to help about all your needs . Highly recommended.,50,840
"Super quaint with only three rooms on-site, the hotel is located just off the highway (very close to the ADO station) and within walking distance to the city centre, fort, and of course, the lagoon.   The rooms were super modern, immaculate, and had everything you would need.   Carmen was there to greet us and offered excellent guidance on getting around and booked us a terrific boat tour.   We loved that it was located in a quiet neighbourhood, away from the blaring music of the city centre.  When we asked about renting bikes to venture out, Carmen had made arrangements for the bikes to be brought to us first thing the next morning! It was service like i had never experienced.   Fresh breakfast in the morning was always great!   We would absolutely stay here again!",50,840
"This is a small family-owned boutique hotel with just 3 rooms. Carmen the owner is the nicest person ever!! So attentive!! My husband and I were on our honeymoon and she received us with a warm welcome and a beautifully decorated room. The rooms are super clean, well kept with all the necessary amenities. When I booked I asked for a coffee machine in advance, and sure enough Carmen placed a coffee machine in our room, with ground coffee to brew, coffee mate, sugar, coffee mugs and spoons. She also place water in a water jug for us to drink. When we first got there she immediately gave us advice as to how to tour Bacalar during our stay. She booked a boat tour for us and even gave us a map. She also gave us advice as to where to eat not to mention driving directions.",50,840
" Additionally, she offered to cook us breakfast every morning and even asked what time we wanted to eat. I cannot express how happy I am that we stayed with Carmen. Seriously the best host ever. Would come back here without a doubt. ",50,840

"We were supposed to stay 3 nights in the hotel. At the first night, we noticed a strong moldy smell and after some looking around the room found, that the whole room was covered in black mold. We went to the receptionist who admitted, that they are having mold issues in the hotel and said, that there is no other room available. We spent the night in the room. The next morning we again contacted the front desk and, that we will leave, because the room is a health hazard. We had some questions regarding the refund for the two nights we paid but were not planning to stay, which they politely said would be no problem, just that we need to sort that via booking. We went on with our vacation, contacted booking regarding the issue and the agent said that they see no problem with the",10,841
" refund, they are just waiting for the hotel to get back to them. At that point they started avoiding the refund situation with excusses like: we do not have the manager here right now, I can not make a decision regarding that and so on. Well 16 days have passed and the hotel does not respond, neither to me, nor booking. They are completley ignoring everything regarding the refund. They are completley ignorant and totaly unprofessional. Still waiting for their respose.....  Also, I would like to add, that besides the black mold, you do not want to look under the beds, because there was three years worth of spider webs and dust mixed with trash. The bathroom was not clean, at our arrival the shower was full of black hair.   The dining area is in the middle of the hotel and all the rooms are facing in that direction. You can forget about sleeping late, because the breakfast will wake you up at 8:00 am.",40,841
…,50,841
Great hotel. Good rooms and nice beds. The roof terrace is nice to hang out in the afternoon an watch the sunset. Breakfast is really good as well. We had a rental car and there is some parking space available. ,50,841
"Booked for 2 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. Lovely location, great staff, comfortable beds, super breakfast. I wish we had stayed longer! They even put beautiful flowers and swan towels and rose petals in our room upon arrival. So genuinely lovely!!",50,841
"The staff is amazing, they go above and beyond. The location is great. Not on the water but just a short walk across the street.  Unfortunately for us we got rain the two days we were there but made the best of it.  The breakfast is great. The rooms are clean but just small.",50,841
"Hotel Sun Ha is in a perfect location in Bacalar right across from the public bathing area and jetty on the lagoon. An easy walk to the centre of town, the Fort and many excellent choices for restaurants right on the water! Our room was quite small but clean and tidy and functional. The upstairs deck was great for relaxing and the breakfast area was very attractive and comfortable. Above all the staff were fantastic - nothing was too much trouble! Thanks Hotel Sun Ha!",40,841
"The staff is the hotel's jewel. Professional, attentive, take care of any request. All there suggestions was great. Thanks to Raoul, Marie Cruz, Regina and all the team. The breakfast is excellent almost more than 10 combinations. We stayed 3 wonderful days. Gracias ",50,841
"Nice hotel in a perfect location only 50m to the public jetty in the lagoon. Modern hotel, very clean rooms, nice staff, phantastic terrace with lagoon view. But be careful, only two rooms have the advertised balcony and our room hat the only window directly to the breakfast area. So if you are looking for a private balcony or a window to see the lagoon, check directly with the hotel. Our room was rather small, did not have the promised balcony and when oping the ddor, other guests taking thei breakfast could see directly to our beds. No fridge",50,841
"Hotel staff were very friendly and super helpful. Raül in the front desk was super nice and he gave us good recommendations of where to eat and where to go. MariCruz and Regina were the best ! Always so friendly with us and with our baby! We really enjoy the delicious breakfast every morning. This hotel is just steps away from the lagoon, you can walk and is public. The atmosphere was so nice and calm that we truly were able to relax. We love Bacalar !! And we will definitely be returning to Sun-Ha hotel.   ",50,841
It is a good hotel. The rooms are clean and there are only a few of them. The location isn’t the best but it is good. The bathrooms smelled like pee but it was probably the chemical they use for the toilet. The cleaning lady didn’t fold our towels. It was good and the servers are nice. Not the best but it is good.,30,842
"If you like small hotels  (less than 10 rooms), privacy and silence, definitely this is the place to be.  Vanesa at the front desk will take care of all your needs and great recommendations The rooms have this minimalistic great looking with “polished” floors that look great. Everything is  super clean and you don’t have to worry about animals or insects.  Every morning, between 5 and 6 you’ll hear the singing of all kind of birds.  All the food (breakfast and meal) is great. But be patient as it is not a rush city service. But the wait is worthy.  The spot in the lagoon is great, you can see all the colors of it and it is “far” enough from all the noise.",40,842
"Special thanks to the manager, Veronica, for the great hospitality!  The villa Miel was outstanding and everything was very clean. The food was exceptional and the staff friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay a lot!",50,842
"We loved staying at Mi Kasa for most of a week.  The staff was lovely, just lovely in every respect, even purchasing a bottle of tequila blanco for us (we're not a fan of mescal or reposado).  The rooms were large and well-appointed.  The dining on site was excellent.  Looking over the lagoon while one eats or drinks is a lovely experience.  The hotel itself is just outside of the city so it is free of noise and partying neighbors.",50,842
"This hotel is sooooo nice!! It's about 5 minutes from the town and sits right on the lagoon! They have paddleboards and kayaks you can borrow at no charge. Victoria the GM is amazing, very welcoming and happy to recomend and guide you. The sunrises are amazing and they have a dock with hammocks where you can enjoy the stars at night!! The Suite is HUGE!! So definately worth the upgrade!! Bacalar is a must visit for great food, great views, and great people!!!",50,842
"This place is beautiful, clean and quiet. Hotel is right on the lagoon surrender by nature away from the town noise.   The rooms are spotless, with cozy bed and nice bathrooms, smart tv included. Hotel also have a lovely pool, and restaurant.  ",50,842
"Sensational, small hotel located north of the center of Bacalar.  The hotel is new, very clean, the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious. There is a restaurant serving very good meals. The hotel also has direct access to the lake and free canoes. The service is very nice and you can feel at home here. We highly recommend  .",50,842
Villa Sunrise is a very lovely place. The hotel is lacated right next to the lagoon which is wonderful. We really enjoyed the time spend here. The staff is very friendly. The Roms are clean and the bed is very big. We would visit another time again.,50,843
"It's a lovely quiet location on the lake with stunning views, though it is 15 minute drive to bacalar itself. My room was very comfortable, huge bed and a nice sized room. It's also very quiet which is great.  However, the hot water was very patchy, usually barely warm enough. And secondly, the breakfast it's truly terrible. The fruit selection, oranges or rock hard star fruit. The hot breakfast, cold completely overcooked scrambled eggs with off bits of veggies in, and some cold black beans. Toast but no butter or margarine. No fresh juice, just squash. We're in the tropics guys, there's beautiful fruit everywhere, stop being so mean at at least get some bananas, papaya etc. Who wants dried out eggs on dry toast and a whole orange for breakfast? At least the coffee was good.",30,843
This place was beautiful I wish we could’ve stayed longer! The room is comfortable with an incredible view of the lake snorkeling and kayaking was fun. The shared kitchen is great looks like there is everything you would need to make whatever you would like. Charcoal Barbecue grill down by the water with chairs and tables to enjoy your meal. I would definitely stay here again. But my favorite part of all was the four month old yellow lab pup.,50,843
"The laguna is very beautiful at this spot. You can rent a kayak to explore the laguna, You can get snorkeling gear for free. The staff is kind and helpful, the breakfast is very good.  Thank you for a great stay!",50,843
"My husband and I recently enjoyed 2 nights at the Bacalar Sunrise Villa. The owners have done a lovely job with this new facility. The dock is easy to negotiate, they have an SUP and bike with pontoons for the water (kayak is broken at the moment) that you can rent, the grounds have whimsical attractions for kids, the common areas are comfortable, and the en-suite guest rooms are spacious and nicely decorated.   Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, and every one of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Kris arranged a sail for us through a friend, which was the highlight of my trip thus far! She also gave us some restaurant options.   The location, at the south end of the lake, is a great location for exploring Chetumal, nearby ruins, and of course, Lake Bacalar itself.",50,843
"This place is magical...staff, super friendly, hotel premises super clean, room was super clean, comfortable and super spacious. Bed was super comfortable. Truly a peaceful place....exactly what i needed.",50,843
"PROS:  Pet Friendly!    New boutique hotel nestled in the jungle and right on Laguna Bacalar. Very modern rooms. Nice modern bathrooms with large shower area and lots of hot water.  Great water pressure too. Plenty of counter-top space in the bathroom.   Very comfortable beds with crisp clean sheets. Good air-conditioning unit in the room.   A pitcher of drinking water was provided in our room. Just outside our door was a 5-gallon water dispenser for replenishing the pitcher.   Our room had a large balcony overlooking the lake.  There was a wall (floor to ceiling) separating each hotel room balcony from the next.  Lots of privacy to sit and look at the beautiful lake. There was a hammock hanging in the balcony, but we moved it to the side because we did not use it.  Fantastic",50,843
" view of the lake from our balcony.  Nice hot breakfast every morning = scrambled eggs, ham, frijoles, fresh fruit, toast, croissants, muffins, and variety of cereals. Fresh brewed coffee ready early every morning.    Community kitchen. We used it one night to make spaghetti. Since we are traveling throughout Mexico for 6 months, we like to be able to cook a meal instead of eating out every day. All the pots and pans were in great shape.  Access to the hotel’s (transparent, see-through) kayak, bikes and SUP.   Nice private dock to hangout or swim from.  Kris, the owner, was very helpful. She offered several suggestions on what to do in the area. She helped us get a boat tour that was Pet Friendly so we could take our two small dogs with us. It was a beautiful tour and the water has all 7 shades of blue. Loved swimming in it.  Free parking for our car. A large parking lot. One could bring an RV in and out of the parking lot without a problem.  Big grassy area for us to play frisbee with our dog (who needs a lot of daily exercise). Cute decorations throughout the property. Swings and trampoline for kids to play on.   CONS:  The hotel needs to put road signs that say “Sunrise Villa Bacalar” and to point which road to take. Also, there is no sign at the property letting you know you have arrived at Sunrise Villa Bacalar. The owner is aware of this and is in the process of making signs.   SUMMARY: As you can see there are more pros than cons.  This is an amazing boutique hotel in a wonderful location. We did not mind that it was 15 minutes to the town of Bacalar or to the town of Chetumal (the capitol of Quintana Roo). Kris and the entire staff were very nice, friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this place for anyone visiting the Laguna Bacalar area.",50,843
…,50,843
We had such an amazing stay! Kris and her team are wonderful. Our room had a comfortable bed with private balcony overlooking the lagoon. Breakfast served was delicious and plentiful. We took a sunrise swim and also a kayak ride later in the day. We would definitely come back and stay longer next time.,20,843
"Hotel Aires is the place to stay in Bacalar! A cute boutique hotel experience it is amazing from the get go. The staff were so very attentive in everything from breakfast to organising tours! The rooms are amazing, big beds, great little balcony’s with a hammock, and the showers were to die for. The grounds of the hotel are kept so nice and the pool is fantastic. You are within walking distance of the lake and 5 mins to the main square.  Would highly recommend and if back in Bacalar we will be 100% staying here",50,844
"Best hotel we’ve stayed in Mexico. Great location, excellent service, and such an amazingly beautiful place. They have the most pretty garden we’ve seen, amazing wall paintings. And the rooms are excellent, large and clean. They’ve provided a baby bed for our daughter and we’re very helpful. And excellent value-for-money",50,844
"You don’t need to be connected to the lagoon to enjoy Bacalar!  In fact, I’m so happy I found this gem. Close to everything in the city and also close to the municipal pier you will find your experience here amazing.   My favorites: sweet balcony with hamac, rooftop for sunrise on the lagoon and sunsets, right next to my favorite restaurant, playita.   I also booked a massage in my room that was perfect in every way!   Staff are incredible, I could talk about this hotel for days!",50,844
"Hidden Gem. This hotel is beautiful and has a very attentive staff. The stay includes free breakfast, which only adds to the attention to details. We’re not talking continental either it’s a full spread of waffles, chilaquiles or scrambled eggs with juice or coffee.   Air conditioning is a life saver.   Close to the lagoon and city center which has restaurants and shops. 10/10 recommend.",50,844
"Super nice hotel, friendly & helpful staff, great location- close to water & lots of good restaurants. Very nice breakfast included. We had Chilaquiles, coffee, orange juice & fruit plate. Clean room and nice bathroom/shower. Balconies have hammocks ",50,844
"The Aires Hotel is awesome through and through! All employees are so incredibly friendly and always tried hard to make our stay pleasant. we were there for 4 days and would have loved to stay longer! When we arrived we had a room on the ground floor we asked whether one on the first floor would be free from tomorrow? When we came back the next day from our boat tour organized by the hotel, our luggage was already in the new room. also the pool just to feel good. and there was also a parking space. So in conclusion: yes, yes and yes again! <3",50,844
"My husband and I just spent two nights at Hotel Aires.  We were greeted by the front desk staff all of whom were very helpful and pleasant.  Our room was extremely clean, the breakfast was very good each day, the pool and surrounding area was relaxing and we very much enjoyed it.  The entire hotel was kept very clean and the environment was excellent and refreshing.  We highly recommend Hotel Aires Bacalar.  Santiago at the front desk was very helpful arranging for our sailing outing and answering our many questions.  Do yourself a favor and spend some time at Hotel Aires.",50,844
"The hotel had us already. Beautiful look of modern art, drawings and reed leaves. El jefe, julia and everyone else have been so friendly and made this stay a pleasure. Rooms and balcony were relaxing and clean. Breakfast was rich.  Marco e Isa",50,844
"Three friends escaped Vidanta and made our way to this magical lagoon in Bacalar.  We loved the hotel, hospitality of the staff and their recommendations for attractions.  Would definitely return to this awesome location.  ",50,844
"Simply beautiful:  We loved the lush garden with succulents and frangipani trees, the neatly maintained pool area & the bamboo façades The rooms are very clean, decorated with beautiful design elements/details and the private bathrooms are spacious and you‘ll get amenities with natural ingredients  The breakfast options are freshly prepared local and healthy The music is very relaxing in the breakfast area & the lobby, at night its quiet and at sunrise you can hear birds singing The vistas from the upper balconies and the roof top are stunning AND ON TOP of this, the staff is genuinely friendly, helpful and absolutely wonderful (they arrange ecofriendly sailing tours or massages for their guests) Don‘t think twice, it can’t get any better than this. Hotel Aires is top notch!",50,844
"Very nice and clean property with friendly  staff. Irving ensured we were taken care of since the moment we arrived.  He showed us around and went over the amenities and set up our Pontoon ride.   Breakfast was delicious and Daisy was very attentive and friendly.    Parking available. Room has coffee and water.  There is also a water  bottle refill station available in common area.   We loved the room ….very charming and relaxing.     This is a lovely hotel, very clean, well kept and charming atmosphere.",50,845
"A small hotel very quiet with only 10 rooms. Breakfast is offered, rooms have A/C and a ceiling fan, we paid in pesos but I think US dollars are accepted as are credit cards. Close to the water so walking distance down. Near lots of restaurants. Generally favourable impression. We were booked for two nights but circumstances changed so we had to leave after only one night. Manager was very co-operative and gave us a partial refund, couldn't get all our money back as part of the cost was tax and she had to pay that even if we weren't there. Main problem was finding the place, street signs are few and far between in the town so fairly east to get turned around. However, it is not a very big town so we didn't stay lost for very long.",40,845
"This place is a little gem. Right from the start, we were very impressed with Hotel Maria Maria. The room is spacious, clean and updated with a large veranda to enjoy the sunrise and a morning coffee. Fantastic location, within two minutes of the lagoon. Very quiet and peaceful. Nice breakfast included in the room rate as well as on-site parking. Friendly, helpful  staff. Not only would I highly recommend this hotel, I will most certainly return, for much longer than my current 3 days.  Bacalar itself is also a gem - suggest getting here before tourism really takes off!!",50,845
"We booked a standard room and when they found out it was our honeymoon, they decorated the room and then asked if they could upgrade us to a suite for a second night as a treat to us. They arranged a great boat tour for us to the lagoon and 3 cenotes (at a much cheaper cost than other tour providers) and helped us arrange our transport on to Tulum. The included breakfast was fruit with yoghurt and granola, toast, juice and tea or coffee - with options to buy other elements. Very friendly staff (despite language barrier!)",50,845
"We stayed at Hotel Maria Maria for 3 nights while in Bacalar. The rooms are clean and modern for a small hotel. The location is good with only a small walk to most of the best restaurants. The owner(Maria) was really nice as we were there on the day of the dead and she explained the history to my two children and also let us taste some of the food she cooked for her family when they came over to celebrate. Hector the manager was also really good and gave us some excellent suggestions on things to do. He suggested we went to ""Los Rapidos"" which is one of the most beautiful places we have been in Mexico so far.",50,845
"Things didn't get off to the best start here, but they sorted it. Basically, I think I had been trying to economise and had booked the cheaper room that claimed to have a balcony and courtyard view. It had neither and it was rather dark. The description on Booking.com is wrong. We complained about this and the owner and her son(I think) apologised and offered to move us for half of what would normally be the extra fee. We thought that was a good compromise, especially as she looked at the description and promised to get in touch with Booking.com and get it changed. The room we ended up in was lovely, immaculately clean with a good sized balcony to sit out on and read. It has an excellent location for strolling into town or down to the lagoon. OK you don't get a lake view, but",40,845
" you don't get the noise either. As with nearly every other place we stayed, the wi fi was poor.",50,845
…,50,845
"The location of this property was great, 5 minutes walk to the main square, 2 minutes walk down to the docs of the lake. The room was lovely, great balcony. Shower was good. Extra safety if you stayed on the upper floor of the hotel. Great service.",50,845
"The manager of the hotel was so sweet with our late arrival. She explained everything and answered any questions we had. The hotel is very clean a small in a perfect walking location to the lagoon and central square. Tons of restaurant options within walking distance. Although the hotel was fully booked, it was quiet and we slept great the entire time! Beds were comfy as well. Will definitely be back! ",50,845
"I brought my mom here for a little girl’s get away. This place is amazing we were here 8 nights and we saw all kinds of people stay here. Singles, couples and families and there was definitely something for everyone. Hobies on site activity directors were amazing. Ask for Gustavo he is so attentive and will make sure that you or your little ones have fun and are comfortable on the kayaks or paddle boards which are FREE btw. I can’t say enough about this place. Food great. Service amazing. Just completely exceeded our expectations! Will definitely be coming back!",50,846
"This is a charming hotel with lagoon front villas! A refreshing swimming pool and 3 piers for you tu access and swim the lagoon. A picture perfect place for sure. The best part is that you have everything you need on location! A new signature restaurant for dinner “Balik”  by Chef Xavier Perez strongly recommended, a bar and restaurant right by the pool and water sports included. If you want to upgrade the experience you can hire a sailboat to tour the lagoon (I strongly recommend this option). But it you just what to paddle board they do have them included. Breakfast is included and is quite complete! Cereal, coffee, Fred fruit, and a main course from the menu!!! A great experience at Bacalar!",50,846
"The central location is perfect to walk almost everywhere the staff is very nice and the food is fresh ! you can enjoy the use of kayak and paddle boards. lagoon is wonderful and we do recommend this place , because of its cool vibe! Mr victor was awesome , gracias  ! We do recommend to book the cabanas over the main building bedrooms.",40,846
"We stayed 3 nights as our friends had a wedding nearby the hotel. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellent and we also had a dinner there one night which was also super tasty.  They have everything you need, o booking included free rental of kayaks and paddle boards which is a must thing to do at the Lagoon. Another must is the Yoga at sunrise, it was an unbelievable experience (also included)  Actually then reason I’ve decided to write is a review is the excellent service we received from the reception. Through WhatsApp we received all the necessary information, further they helped us with everything arranging taxis (with good prices) , laundry service and room service. It felt like we have a personal assistant. Special thanks for that to Rexna",50,846
 Berenice. :),50,846
…,50,846
"From the moment we arrived, Berenice made us feel incredibly welcomed. Everything was perfect, Marcos our waiter was fantastic, and all the staff at the bar as well. Thank you to Reyna and Victor too!",50,846
"What a gem! When you find a place that’s so wonderful, you don’t want others to know, so they don’t flood the location and ruin its beauty. This is that kind of place! From check in to our wonderful 5 days stay, I have no complaints. The staff made you feel like family and the breakfast served was delicious. They’re located in a part of the Lagoon that boast soft white sand/mud beneath the water with the most crystalline waters we saw during our entire 2 weeks stay at Laguna Bacalar. The hotel is pet friendly, so bring your furry buddy with you. I highly recommend a stay here and will definitely return.",50,846
Loved this place! The view of the lagoon was amazing! The service and staff were fantastic. The food and drinks were delicious. I was there with friends and our kids for 6 nights and we had a great time. I will definitely go back to Bacalar and stay there for sure.,50,846
"Our stay at Casa Bakal was incredible. The staff was all SO SO HELPFUL AND KIND. Stephany, David, Pablo, Jesus, and Rodo were just a few staff members that really stuck out to us and made our experience better. The bungalows we had were very simple, no tv, fridge, or mirrors but we didn’t mind much. The view from the hotel is beautiful, with a small pool and a boardwalk leading to the lake. They rent paddle boards and one person kayaks free of charge right by the lake. There is complementary breakfast daily and they offer excellent lunch options for purchase. The hotel is also pet friendly! Definitely recommend to anyone staying in Bacalar.",30,846
"Vine con mi Familia y nos gusto mucho, todos son muy amables, la comida súper rica, no es necesario salir a comer. Con los Kayaks y Paddle que te prestan te entretienes mucho. Asael y Santos nos atendieron de maravilla!  Los cuartos muy limpios, solo hace falta un closet para acomodar la ropa.",50,847
"El hotel está padrisimo, ideal para escaparte a relajarte. Los cuartos súper cómodos y tienen kayaks para que puedas usarlos en tu estancia.  La atención y la comida son espectaculares!  Azael Paat y Santos nos brindaron el mejor servicio, súper atentos y agradables.",50,847
"El hotel es muy cómodo, la atención qué brindan en el restaurante es excelente y toda la comida está deliciosa, el trato es amigable. Las instalaciones están en buenas condiciones y puedes realizar distintas actividades por parte del hotel, cuentan con un tour por la laguna a un precio accesible y ofrecen el uso de Kayaks completamente gratis.",50,847
"El lugar está increíble, de verdad vale la pena.  La Laguna de verdad está preciosa, además te prestan unos Kayaks padrísimos para ir a conocer la Laguna y Andrea la host es súper atenta!!   Lo recomiendo 100% para parejas, los cuartos están increíbles y súper callado.",50,847
"Other than the hotel's location, there is no reason to recommend staying here!  We had stayed here before, and it was an adequate place.  I can't say that now!  The rooms were in poor condition, paper thin walls let us hear conversations in other rooms, the bed linen was not clean, lumpy pillows...  The rats outside were the last straw!  Skip this hotel!",20,848
"Do not expect any luxuries, for the price it is a good deal , just to sleep and shower it is very well located , you can see everything you want to see in bacalar walking that is why we decided to stay there overnight",40,848
Low cost hotel. Great view to the lagoon. Cleand and tidy. You get more than what you pay for. Cleand sheets and towels free coffee and one of the very least hotels with a/c in the area. Very close to the town and forth. It has no restaurant but close to some good options. You can rent activities at the hotel,50,848
"The rooms are a good size. This is probably the cheapest hotel that we stayed in during a three week trip. The beds, bed linen, towels etc reflected this. But it wasn't bad and certainly value for money. The location, next to a park, means that you risk events having loud music until the early hours (we were unlucky). It is basically a sleeping location. There were young families and a wonderful group of 'older ladies' who chatted and played cards on the grass. It doesn't do food, you need to go out.  That isn't a problem because the town square is five minutes walk away with a choice of places to have breakfast or other meals. The upside it was clean, is right by the lake, and you can swim from the garden. (The air con didn't work - not a big deal)",30,848
Great place to spend a nigth or weekend with the person you love. I enjoyed my stay especially when it was time to swim in the lagoon of the 7 colours ! great for the entire family . great customer service and friendly staff,40,848
"Great deal!  Right on the lake, nice dock to walk and swim from, close enough to walk to the town center and restaurants.  Beds were comfy, showers good.  Don't count on this for morning coffee.  Jar of decafe nescafe and a pot of hot water.",40,848
"Me and my fiancé loved this hotel. It has a big room and stunning view. On the main floor there is a place to relax next to the beach.  The location is perfect- on the Laguna and close to the center. There are boat tours next to the hotel and they are with the cheapest price we could find in the area.  We asked them for recommendation for a place to eat and they gave us a voucher for 2 margaritas in a nice meat restaurant.   Cons: the room is dark and there is no breakfast, but we found some place close with great breakfast(manati) ",40,848
Nice hotel directly beside the lagune shore with a pier and chairs to lay on for sunbading! The rooms were spacious but the beds a bit hard. Friendly staff! Fresh water in the lagune and ideal for snorkeling although not much to see under the surface.,40,848
"We came to Bacalar in night and were looking for some hotel where we may sleep. We cannot find there any hotel which was opened. Finally we found this hotel near a lake. It cost 800 pesos per night. It was simple but clean and spacious. You may find there everything you need when you are on the trip. I think that probably majority of their clients stay there only for one night. Bacalar looks like it is after its big times of tourism.You may see the whole village in one hour. Round trip around the lake cost 250 pesos and it lasts 1,5 hour.",30,848
"Nearly $60 is what they charged for a double. The lovely location and the fact that we did not get a chance to read tripadvisor before leaving home. The ""gotcha factor"". Mattresses hadn't been turned in years, towels with huge holes... Come on now you cheap so and sos! They spend plenty on the outside bright yellow wash. Awful shower head. Just SUPER CHEEPO all the way round. Accept only cash - probably don't pay any taxes. No front desk service. Ran out of t-paper.  Can I stop already? Oh yeah, the a/c was great!",30,848
"Not worth the money. Basic room, terrible breakfast, uninterested personel, chairs and kanoos near the water broken. How they dare to ask this money. Als no help with tours, no drinks available, no shops around. Most bad deal in town.  ",10,849
"Muy agradable el hotel.La pase súper bien.....el personal súper atento y lo mejor que caminando llegas a todos lados 15 min al centro y av costera donde está la Laguna 8 min caminando,sin duda regresaría",50,850
"Hotel tranquilo alejado del centro, habitaciones amplias, limpias y sin ruidos. Especialmente agradecer al Sr. Carlos que siempre estaba pendiente de que todo estuviera a tu gusto. Una gran persona siempre atento a los clientes y solucionando cualquier problema que pudieras tener ",50,851
"Sin duda una excelente opción de descanso en el pueblo mágico de bacalar, donde el cordial carlos y su gran equipo de trabajo te harán sentir como en casa, además del hospedaje entre sus amenidades cuenta con bicicletas y un delicioso café cortesía de la casa",50,851
"L'albergo si trova nella zona residenziale, un po lontano dalla spiaggia della laguna pero noi eravamo con macchina e questo non era un problema. La camera era spaziosa e ben pulita. Il personale gentilissimo. Il vantaggio maggiore e' un parcheggio privato gratuito. Si consegnano teli mare. Tutta la notte c'e una persona sorvegliando l'entrata della struttura che senz'altro e' ben chiusa. Siamo rimasti molto contenti. L'unico difetto e' che l'aqua calda e da caldaia e finisce molto presto. La seconda e in nostro caso terza persona devono aspettare certo tempo per scaldarsi di nuovo. L0 raccomandarei volentieri.",40,851
"Sous des aspects modernes, cet établissement est désastreux. Eau froide, insonorisation nulle ce qui permet d’être au première loge pour le concert d’aboiements et des invités du personnel qui profites de la piscine en picolant et fumant sans compter les rires bruyants. Le prix est bas mais Cher finalement pour une d’insomnie... ",10,851

"The hotel is very nice, rooms are big and very clean and the garden area is cool for breakfast. 24h reception makes you feel safer. Good WIFI. The location is perfect, just a few steps away from everything. The staff is extremely helpful. Adrián made us feel like home and helped us sorting out all the activities while in Bacalar. When we left we forgot a couple of things in the hotel and he arranged for it to get dropped off back in Tulum for us at no extra cost at all. The best costumer service ever! Totally coming back!!!  Alex and Judit",50,853
"This hotel is run by a very nice family.  In their backyard they have a building with about eight rooms on two floors  The rooms have good beds, a hot shower and a good working air conditioner. WiFi is slow but ok.  In their garden there are some tables and chairs where you can sit during the day or evening.  The hotel is walking distance from the main square and many restaurants and bars. It’s also ten minutes walking form the public ‘beach’ (free) where you lay in the sun or take a swim in the crystal clear water. ",40,853
"The hosts are super friendly and happy to please. A hearty breakfast is included. The views are outstanding from Las Nubes. The hosts are new and working on upgrades, which are required at the dock and in some of the rooms.  The property is beautiful and I recommend it!   Best if you have a car, as it is out town.",40,854
What a sunrise and birds in the morning!   This hotel is located close to town but not that close which make it a great place to see nature specially birds.   The staff was so nice that even they offered to prepare coffee at 4 am before we go for a birding trip!   Very clean and we felt safe.  I recommend this hotel for nature lovers and birders as the birds come to your window!   ,50,854
"I was fortunate to spend 4 days at Las Nubes in Bacalar and couldn't have been more happy. It is obviously right on the water which is right where you want to be and it has everything you need to enjoy the laguna: kayaks, SUPs, peddle boats, docks, lounge areas, etc. The breakfast was delicious, the rooms were comfortable and the staff is amazing! We will definitely come back and stay in this little piece of paradise. The value is incredible!",50,854
"We loved this hotel, wonderful view and direct access to the lagoon!  with multi-level seating areas, very cute and small.  The breakfast was amazing: fresh granola, eggs, fresh squeezed fruit juice, and great service.. more than we could eat!  The rooms are large and comfortable with a modern and simple design, I particularly liked the front room by the gazebo, with wonderful exotic wood decor. The management is very attentive and the prices are reasonable:  would highly recommend.",50,854
"Las Nubes was an amazing place to stay during our trip to Bacalar. The rooms are spacious, great air conditioning, and views of the lagoon right from the room. They also provide breakfast which was made to order and 5 star service.   They have paddleboats and kayaks to rent too. My favorite part of the hotel is the multi tiered terraces that go down to the dock. Great place to visit with family or friends!",50,854
"Definitely one of the places you need to visit if you want an amazing view for a romantic escape, I will come back very soon. The host are incredible people who are always trying to make you happy. Highly recommended",50,854
"Ahora les cambiaron el nombre y se llama XO Bacalar Lakefront, en primera el lugar está viejo y descuidado, nuestra habitación tenía un fuerte olor a caño que provenía de la regadera y fue muy incómodo ya que impregnaba todo el cuarto. Las toallas igual viejas, al menos limpias pero nos tocó una que decía Promotora Residencial, osea no sabemos si fue de un huésped que la olvido o qué pasó. La cortina del baño rota, ek conclusión les falta bastante mantenimiento. Lo único rescatable fue el desayuno, ese si muy rico y suficiente. La chica que nos recibió en recepción en el día muy amable en cambio había dos chicos por la noche y fatal su servicio, con mucho esfuerzo hablaban. En conclusión JAMÁS regresaríamos por ese precio pueden quedarse en otros hoteles mil veces más lindos y",10,855
"My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights in casa Bambù in August. It’s a small hotel, managed by a lovely family. They organise a boat tour of the Laguna (one of the most beautiful place we’ve seen in Mexico). The frontlaguna room is amazing, with a private patio with direct to water. We arrived very late in the night and the host has been very kind to provide us a dinner. The hotel is very quiet and perfect for a couple who want to spend some relaxing days.   Biagio&Gaia",50,856
"Hotel pequeño, nuevo con acceso directo a la laguna y un bonito muelle. Lo malo: NO reciben tarjetas! Ojo! esto es bien importante, si no llevas efectivo, toca ir al pueblo que está retirado! y el hotel no es fácil de encontrar porque no tiene letrero. El internet no llega a las habitaciones y en el lobby es muy deficiente.  Desayuno empiezan a servir 8.30, así que si vas a salir de paseo antes no aplica. Cero amenities en la habitación! No hay TV (para algunos esto suma, así para otros no). Es más como un Hostal mochilero, pero con precio de hotel Boutique. Le falta mucho para atender bien a los clientes.",30,856
"Un lugar increíble en donde Fernanda y Jonatan nos atendieron extraordinariamente, la casa está ubicada junto al lago por lo que la vista es espectacular, la tarifa incluye el desayuno el cual es delicioso y la renta de kayak por lo que puedes visitar la laguna y disfrutar al máximo la experiencia ",50,856
"Es increíble este lugar, no hubo absolutamente nada malo todo es un 10 definitivo. De verdad el servicio es maravilloso y tienen un sistema muy ordenado y práctico para ellos y para el cliente estar en contacto, desde antes hacen un grupo por whatsapp y te envían toda la información y están a tus órdenes. Donde se encuentran más de 2 personas atendiendo tus dudas o solicitudes, tienes su atención 100% jamás había visitado un lugar así. Definitivamente es una EXPERIENCIA. Las cabañas (todas) son únicas. Todo muy limpio y muy bonito, muy relajante. Además es pet friendly es maravilloso",50,857
"The place is a 8 room complex, it has a shared diner, terrace, dock and beach. The location is amazing given that is right on the water and you can access the water by a sandy beach and a spacious dock with hammocks, chairs and a cool overwater net. They have kayaks and paddle boards in place which is pretty cool. The room I stayed at was a king sized bed with beautiful view to the water and TV. Everything was clean, the service personnel attentive and helpful, seems like there's new management. I enjoyed a peaceful time reading on the dock. The restaurant next door is delicious and they have music bands playing some evenings, the day I stayed was jazz night and I could tell that there are other nights with salsa and guitar players.",50,858
All the normal amenities but only 1 closed restaurant within walking distance. Enjoyed using free kayak but refrained from swimming as lake very shallow and bottom muddy. Friendly staff. Easy check in and out.,40,858
"There was one night there and my boyfriend. We arrived at the site and it was empty of people and we did not find anyone to accept us. Finally we found a note on the refrigerator with a phone number, called the number, and the guy in charge came to check in. There was no water in the shower. The cleanliness of the room was very bad. The location was also not good, to get to the center there is a 10 minute walk or more The only plus is the beautiful pier in the garden towards the lagoon.",10,858
"Nous sommes allés dîner à l'hôtel sans connaître la carte ou les tarifs. La cuisine est très copieuse en plus d'être très bonne. Les tarifs sont plus élevés que les ""petits"" restaurants mais restent abordables. Le service était top avec une serveuse très souriante ! Nous étions seulement les 4 à dîner ce soir là, dommage pour un si bel endroit...",50,859

"Caroline dont allow wifi around the talking area. You know travellers, for god sake talk  to each other? Your not travellers if based on your mobile phone, particularly in a place like this! God! Common sense?  She is sensational and wonderful!, Caroline from the USA!  Last there like 4 years ago or so, and she was ill then. Hope you are doing great now Caroline! Regards Peter from Denmark! ;)  Best setting in Laguna Bacalar..And Caroline knows everything going around...Just ask!  A lovely lady, who made a very special place in the miss of mass tourism. You get a home here! And meet people!",50,860
"The place looked cosy, but after we moved in we realized that the place was unpleasant since the host behaved erratic and mean. I was scared since he got really angry due to a minor misunderstanding. There were ants in my bed, but I didn't dare to complain. We felt sorry for the staff, they were constantly under oppression from the crazy host.",10,860
We stayed here a couple nights and enjoyed the amazing views of the Lagoon and swimming from the pier. They are a budget friendly place to stay and very chill.  They also have boats for excursions to different places on the Lagoon. ,40,860
"Beautiful site! We started out in another accommodation but it was full of people making a lot of noise and dogs barking all night. We decided to move to Casita Carolina and could not have been happier! We stayed in a cute little trailer camper, very well priced. Snug but for camping way better than a tent!  Beautiful gardens, relaxed atmosphere, friendly owners and a view to die for! Only good things to say about this place. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.",50,860
"I did an overnight stop at Casita Carolina. They have a variety of accommodation styles here - a few different types of room, two cute little caravans and a camping area.  I stayed in the yellow room. If I'm honest, it was a sweatbox. It was very hot overnight, even with 2 fans blowing. One on the ceiling, one at the end of the bed. Otherwise the room was fine. I can't comment on other accommodation.  The owner is lovely, and made me feel very welcome. There's coffee on the terrace in the morning, and water available at all times. Wifi only works in this area, but it's strong.  The X factor with Casita Carolina is its lagoon front location two blocks from the centre of sleepy Bacalar. It's a sublime setting which they use well. There's a lovely lawn with sun loungers and a",40,860
" gazebo. You can rent kayaks, and there's a jetty to sit on/jump off.   To summarise, you can't go wrong at 600 (cash) for the night. It's beautiful.  Top tip - get up early for sunrise. It's immense!",50,860
…,20,860
"A small clean place in Bacalar just in front of the most amazing view, it's a budget friendly place to stay, the room shares a kitchen and a living room with another room, the kitchen has a normal sized fridge, it is in my opinion fully equipped and this can help you save money on food... The rooms are good, nothing fancy or special, but that's not a problem since the view and the garden are beautiful!!! The location is priceless, just in walk-in distance from the center of the town 2-3 minutes, most hotels here don't have this quality.",50,860
"Things did not get off well with Casita Carolina. They have a backward policy that requires guests to email 48 hours in advance to confirm your already confirmed booking. Even if you email earlier that week, without another email 48 hours in advance they will not hold you're booking. We have been backpacking around mexico and was only able to email 36 hours in advance and upon arrival they had already on-sold our third night. Leaving us without a room for a final night in bacalar. It was never stated in any of our correspondence that they would on-sell our room if the 48 hour email was not confirmed. And the sneakiest and most infuriating part of this is they did not respond to our email and just allowed us to turn up with an incomplete booking - if we had known they had",50,860
" cancelled one of our 3 nights we would have most definitely booked another guest house. Appalling service. And downright sneaky.  Obviously off to a poor start the stay did not improve. We had bugs and lizards in our room. Cold showers.  The jetty was being repaired and was not in use (literally one of the biggest reasons to go here is the long jetty into the Blue lagoon). With the repair comes ongoing construction noise, so no tranquil setting here.  They have kayaks available but no one is home during the day so we had to wait until one of the workers opened the house to get the paddles at 4pm. The kitchen is not readily available for guests and on the rare occasion we used it, we didnt feel welcomes. Literally I have several other things to write but I vowed not to waste my time of this review/place.   The only reason we gave it 2 stars was the location. Literally on the water of the 7 blue coloured lagoon. Absolutely beautiful.   But don't be mislead this place has some ancient policies, especially for travellers and backpackers who can't always be online or emailing to confirm.   There are many other beautiful places in bacalar and we would recommend you go find them and give this place a miss.   I'd love to here their feedback about this.  Peace   ",30,860

Best place to rent kayaks? Best place to buy groceries? Etc.—always with lots of smiles. I miss hearing Ellie calling everyone, “hija/hijo” and “corazon” :) And watching Regino looking after the garden and the fruit trees like they’re family (because they are!).   We called everyone that offers camping in Bacalar before making a decision and this was not only the best deal price wise, but you’re literally 1 minute from the lagoon, the hostel itself is beautiful, laid-back AND you will have the best hosts of any hostel I have stayed in while traveling a month in Mexico.

We recommend it highly.",50,868

"Close enough  to the centre of Bacalar (not on the lake shore itself though), this is a good hotel with fair prices. The staff was friendly and let us fill up our water bottles. Only negative would be that the wifi didn't reach our room (but did work in the lobby)",40,868

It is a good, basic and friendly bed for the night and is very well priced for the area.   Antonio was also spot on with all his local recommendations.",50,868
"We found this hotel after walking around a few and finding prices higher than expected. The price for our room at Guadelupe was much lower than we saw listed online.  The rooms are very clean and the bed is great. We chose a room without A/C, but the ceiling fan was really good and kept us very cool. There's even a hammock you can tie up in your room if you just want to chill! They're not luxury rooms, but nicer than you usually get for this price. Best wifi I've had in a while as well.  The location is good. One block back from the square, 100 meters from the #2 restaurant in Bacalar on Tripadvisor, a supermarket, and good local food.  The owner is a super nice guy and great to chat to. He was really helpful in telling us places to go, and things to do.  We stayed an extra",50,868

The guided tour was great! The water was a bit cold, but expected once these are cabe cenotes. I was a bit scared and had a bit of an anxiety once the caves are small , high water , and a couple bats flying around lol. But would do it all over again!

On our way to the open one , going thru the jungle , we had a visit of 2 medium to big sizes monkeys which were jumping from one tree to another. Quite of an experience !! It was very fun to spot them and they will mind their business but my boyfriend decided to stay extra minutes to film them. Well, I don’t think they like that , they hissed at him lol. So a little side note, admire them but don’t try to be friends with them. Once we got to the cenote, oh my!! It s a big open one! Soooo beautiful and so big too! We swam and snorkeled for a while. What a beautiful formation! Would do it again!! ",30,869

Bebimos dos piñas coladas, una naranjada, una limonada con menta y un speed coffee que contiene Kalua y fue el descubrimiento del día. Pagamos aprox. 165 por persona, con una bebida de alcohol y un plato de comida. El lugar es muy relajado, y puedes disfrutar tu comida en un lounge frente a la laguna o el deck del lugar.

We drank two piña coladas, an orangeade, a lemonade with mint and a speed coffee that contains Kalua and it was the discovery of the day. We pay approx. 165 per person, with a drink of alcohol and a plate of food. The place was very relaxed and you can enjoy your meal at a lounge or a deck rigth infront fo the lagoon",50,869

Everything was clean and the room was lovely, we had a big balcony, AC worked perfectly, best bathroom (and room) we had in Mexico at the moment !!  Thank you for everything. ",50,871
"{This is written in London on 1/4 referring to our stay on Friday and Saturday nights 10-11/3. I could not find it on TA originally so notified TA as a new hotel. Now I am back in London (1/4) with decent internet I found it on TA with a review on 28/3 but no images (I was not notified of its being accepted!). The internet here is far quicker here for uploading so here goes. This is its second review!  We three middle aged British guys were staying in El Roble opposite as it was in our price bracket. Arrived tired after long walk so did not notice alternatives close by. In the morning I noticed La Lunas almost opposite! It must have been beyond our price bracket so we did not check it out online, I popped in to investigate and the friendly receptionist (turned out to be Delilah)",50,871
"This place is practically not a hostel anymore. The room was miserable, and most of the services they list were unavailable. My understanding is that the place has financially suffered from Covid-19 and undergone major administrative changes. They now use the room next to the gate/by the street as the reception area, which is also the place where the volunteers/staff are housed and the sheets/towels are stored. This is also the room where hostel customers are housed. So, anyone who comes to check in or ask for something pops into this small and heavily congested room and looks for someone to answer them, if they can find someone. I had a 3-day booking and arrived late (3: 00 am) due to the strange hours of the ADO bus (the only one running on my route). I had emailed them in",10,872
" advance about this late check-in and been told to knock on the window to get them check me in. One of the volunteers checked me in after confirming my reservation on his phone, and I paid him for my stay in cash, as requested. The room did not have an AC, only fans, some of which were broken. I only slept a few hours that day and had to sleep in one of the hammocks outside for the rest 2 days because the room was unbearably too hot. The bathroom was dirty and stank, and the room always smelled like the bathroom. I just used the toilet in the bathroom and used the showers outside. Sİnce there was no centralized reception/check-in system, each time one of the volunteers saw me the first time, I had to explain them who and when checked me in, as if I was some outsider trying to justify my presence. There is no centralized record-keeping or cross-communication among the staff. My booking also included breakfast,but the volunteer who checked me in told me there would be no breakfast. I let it go and went for the kitchen to prepare something for breakfast myself, but I was literally blocked by this woman the moment I stepped into the living space/kitchen area in the adjacent place. She said the place was unavailable because a group of people reserved it as a whole and they had just finished cleaning. I asked whether there was another kitchen I could use and she said ""there is a toaster upstairs,"" which didn't even make sense since she wasn't letting me go inside anyway. I again let it go and walked all the way to the downtown to eat. I spent most of my days enjoying the lagoon and sightseeing etc. and used the garden area when I was in the hostel, including sleeping in the hammock during the night time. I briefly used the kayak equipment in the garden, making up for the lack of breakfast. On my last day, I packed my belongings and placed them by the wall in the room and went for a swim. After I came back, I had a shower in one of the showers in the garden and passed time in the garden area until it was time for my departure bus, which was scheduled for 6:15 pm. Just before leaving, I went into the living space/kitchen area to charge my phone and eat some snacks I had. The previous group had already left, and I assumed the people around were other hostel customers using one of the rooms upstairs. I saw that the hostel rules were listed on the counters in the kitchen and living room and read them very carefully. They clearly listed the living room, kitchen, and the balcony upstairs as the common areas and went ahead with mentioning the rules of using them. I just went to the balcony briefly to look at the view and take  a photo before I left the hostel. Unlike our room, the entire place was impecabbly clean and neat. I was just about to leave for my bus, trying to take home positive feelings and ignoring all the inconvenience when one of the volunteers and the same woman who had blocked me the other day came to me to scold that I was not supposed to go in there because it was rented as a house to another group (Spanish-speaking), who apparently asked the woman who the hell I was and what I was doing there. While I was trying to be positive and let go all the nuances, these people were just seeing me as a pest!!! I was quite embarassed to think that the group who rented the entire place thought I was an outsider while I thought I was just using the common areas, as I am entitled to since this is supposedly a hostel, and the living room/kitchen/balcony area were supposed to be common areas, which was clearly identified in the hostel rules listed. I had to tell the woman and the volunteer by her about all the inconveniences they have made me go through in the past three days, including no breakfast, miserable room conditions, sleeping in the hammock at nights, showering in the garden and now being treated like a pest because they suddenly decide to rent the entire place as a whole and throw hostel customers to that miserable room/hostel storage area/reception/staff-housing place by the road, with no keys or lockers. Suddenly I was shamed for being a negative person and yelled at for going into other customers' area when I thought I was just using the common areas. She kept saying that the check out is at 12:30. What is to check out? There was no key to hand back, I did not even sleep in the room for the last 2 days, and I had already packed my belongings. I just did not put my baggage outside the room because it is by the road and any bypassers can take it away. In other words, I did check out the room. Isn't it normal to pass time in common areas until your departure? Checking out does not mean leaving the premises. You can spend time in a hotel lobby, restaurant, bar whatever. She obviously remembers the check-out time but how about the breakfast that was supposedly included in the price? How about the common places that a hostel is supposed to have? She says the price was just for the bed. That is not what is listed at Hostels.com, and a hostel is never ""just a bed."" If you decide to run the place differently than before, then why are you accepting hostel customers through Hostels.com and listing services that are not available anymore? They simply trap you, eagerly take your money, do not stand by their promises, and treat you like a pest, and when you finally complain, they shame you for being negative. Avoid this place; it is only a ghost of a hostel. After this bad experience, I started to make each of my bookings during the rest of my trip for only one night and extended daily if I liked the place.",50,872
…,50,872
"Loved everything here. The energy of this place & the sunrise just in front of Casa Lahar! The location is perfect, away from the city centre yet walking distance nearby. The beautifull & magical lagoon just in front. Friendly staff that spoke good english and always ready when needed. Thank you Dani, Legna and everyone else for this great experience. Definitely coming back to this place when I'm in Bacalar. And love to recommend Casa Lahar.",50,872
"So I stayed with my family at casa lahar I reserved an individual cabin for 4. We arrived and they allowed us to check in before 3 because the room was ready Wich made it easier for us because we were only there for one night. So we got to do the tour they offer you around the lagoon. Later we went into town to catch some dinner then the next day we had a continental breakfast included with our reservation in the hostel. Everything was nice and clean and most important we had our own bathroom, although the cabin didn't have air conditioning there was a fan for everybed so we were okay. I do recommend casa lahar it's a very chill experience and you have the lagoon a few steps away.",30,872
I would definitely recommend checking this place out! I had a very nice ambiance to it. There are private rooms available with a shared bathroom (bathroom was very clean) the option to tent also. Amir is the tour guide for that casa....amazing personality and great energy! I will be back...and I’ll remember to bring the keys with me this time! Hahaha much love ,20,872
"Hostel has a nice location on lake front where on can rent rooms, share rooms, rent tents or bring tents. However, it is sometimes loud when camping outdoors. Casa Lahar is ""pet friendly"" which sometimes means that people bring dogs that are aggressive or bark a lot. This happened while I was there. There is little English spoken so knowing Spanish is a plus. There is only one plug to charge electronics and no table near the plug to put your laptop or pad so you can easily type on it while it is charging.",10,872
"We booked an individual room but when we came the bathroom was a sharing bathroom with other rooms  The bathroom is so small and dirty, the smell was reaching the room  It’s noisy, everything is falling down in the room and everywhere else  The staff service is inexistent  A lot of people are coming from outside of the hotel to go on tours in the lagoon   It’s definitly overpriced for what it is. When you go to bacalar you are not looking for this",30,872
"I found the staff here to be money hungry, no luggage room and the owner wasn’t too impressed when we asked where to store our luggage after checkout until our bus at 2pm. He said in the hall upstairs but if it wasn’t gone by 1.30pm we owed 35 pesos each. The hostel is outside of the town and about a 20/25 minute walk to anything, there should be bikes for free or at a cheap price. No breakfast included and the tents for camping are tiny. Once you check out there is only one outdoor shower for you to use with a sheet that blows in the wind as the door. I don’t think the staff care for you much especially not once you check out. Free water refill is pretty standard in hostels and it didn’t exist here either",10,872
"As mentioned in previous reviews, we had an uncomfortable stay due to a very closed, unfriendly, pretentious atmosphere. Most people there are volunteers or family members so we felt like intruders in their space!  Not friendly...not attentive at all.   Regarding booking, when we reserved a twin room we expected 2 beds but instead were welcomed with a double bed and sofa bed with no sheets.  First night there was no water.  Bit dirty in some communal areas and to get into the kitchen we had to pass the family who were dominating the space most of the time...  Don't spend your money here... there are better places.",20,872
"We stayed for 2 nights. The owner was very friendly and helpful. Gave us a few great tips for food and things to do.  There are two dogs roaming around, but they are very good behaved. So as long as youre not terribly afraid of lovable short-legged dogs, i can fully recommend this place.  Would go there again.",50,873
"We stayed for two nights and had a great time! The place feels cozy and has a great tropical vibe. The cabanas are not that big, but big enough to leave your stuff and have a good sleep - airconditioning/electricity works really well! The cabanas come with a seperate bathroom with toilet/shower for your own use. Nice swimming pool and places to hang out and relax. You can also eat/drink something at the bar and WiFi is available. Had a great time overall!",50,873
"I loved the concept of the B&B and had a very pleasant stay there with my mother. The staff is extremely friendly, you can feel they truly care about how much of a great stay their guests are having. The place is in really good shape and fits the price range well. Spending a night in a tube-shaped room was quite the memorable experience, I hope to stay there again sometime soon!   A few things to note: (1) the crowd is generally quite young (might not be the best option if you’re looking for a very quiet place) and (2) the hotel is a bit far from the main attractions (then again, anything close to the center is extremely expensive if you’re on a tight budget and you can reach the center very easily by bike/taxi)",50,873
"I stayed there for one night but I wish I had stayed longer. From the autobus station you can easily get a taxi cab for 30-40 pesos to get you to this magical place! Since I arrived very late, they have left me my room’s key and everything was in order. The next morning, they prepare your breakfast and you can enjoy it with lot à of interactions with the owners and staff, reachable & responsive at all times. I used the bike for free and got around Bacalar by it!  Last but not least, you can have pizza or a drink with travelers and the amazing owners ! They’re expanding now their propriety, I wish you guys the best of luck and I really hope I can get back there one day.  To sum up, I really truly recommend. Original and cozy atmosphere with thoughtful and nice owners. Con mucho",50,873

"We were two couples traveling through Quintana Roo and we all agreed staying here was one of the highlights of our trip. It is such a special place and we had a wonderful time.  The setting is beautiful, with the ""tubos"", the pool, the string lights, the decor, and all of the nice touches you find in every corner. The experience of staying in the tubo was awesome. The included breakfast was yummy.  Karla and Abi are the best hosts. Very nice and friendly, and very helpful with recommendations on things to do and giving us the contact for a tour in the lagoon. We had an amazing time with them and other guests at night, with good music, pizza, and drinks.  If you are planning a trip to Bacalar and still undecided on where to stay, go ahead and book this place; you'll love it! ",50,873

"First time for me in a hostel and I think this one is the coolest one, great ambience and service, the owner is so nice and attentive the place very quiet and also de bar is beautiful with a good vibe. And reasonable prices for very good quality, we loved it ",50,873
We are very happy we stayed in this small hotel in Bacalar. It's in quiet area very close to the best restaurants ever! The host is very helpfull and very nice person. Breakfast was very good. Bedroom clean. Bacalar is amazing place to visit.,50,874
"Large and clean room, quiet. Nice access to the lagune at just 5 min. The lady running the place was adorable, and helped us when my friend was sick. Breakfast is good too, and there are lots of places to park.",50,874
"The hotel is small and cozy, 3 min walking to the lagoon. Small room but nice. Good wifi in room. They do they best to help and are always very kind. Breakfast is very good and a big plus. They offer kayaks for free for one hour (you just have to pay the lagoon tax at the dock).",40,874
"Breakfast was good, the bedroom was clean.  Nice and helpful staff letting us using the kayak 1h30mins for free, and kind especially after I was beaten by a scorpion *be careful in the lagoon*   The hotel is a bit old and our two beds weren't comfy at all. I and my partner decided to sleep on the two beds instead of sharing one as they were actually both small.  The room wasn't big and the bathroom tiny, with the lavatory outside the bathroom, in the room.  Lots of dogs barking in the night around the hotel, we didn't sleep well.   A bit upset as we mainly booked this hotel to use the 1h free kayak but we had to take them to the lagoon ourselves walking (10 mins but still heavy) and we had to pay 200MXN ($10) each to access the lagoon / in other places is 50MXN! The staff didn't",20,874
" give any information on where to go in the lagoon and didn't have a clue about us going around, so we ended up paddling randomly, missing important stops as people weren't able to give any information on where to go.  I would have rented the kayak somewhere else and this made me feel we paid a lot and the hotel is not even in front of the lagoon as it seems described on the profile.  Breakfast could be a bit richer and with more options for the overall price.  Parking is small, we had a tiny car and we were fine but if you have a standard one can be a problem.   I wouldn't recommend it, there are other nicer and cheaper options in Bacalar.",40,874
…,20,874
"The treatment was excellent, the staff very friendly and the food of our breakfast delicious, I would only recommend remodeling the terrace space and maintenance of your garden, I think it would be nicer if you put it nice!",10,874
"The good: the staff service, they are very warm! The bad: very noisy hotel, inside and in the surroundings... all day, all night. Could not sleep. The ugly: the hotel is announced as it was on the shores of the lagoon when in fact it is a block away.",50,874
"We did not manage to stay in this hotel since, despite the credit card left for guarantee for our reservation, when we arrived (2 Jan around 9pm, one hour later the expected) we found the room already assigned to another client, and had to find another accommodation with the help of the owner. It was a clear case of overbooking, but we have been debited for the first night (without having the possibility to get the room. The onwer argued that since she did not see us by 6pm, she assumed we wold not have arrived anymore so she sold the room to other people. But, i insist, booking.com took the credit card for guarantee and and amount of MXN 1.309 was taken from my c.c..",40,874
"We booked the last room available and it was a little room with a fan and a balcony. The room was really small and with only a fan it was warm. But we knew what we booked and the room was clean, bed was comfortable and the balcony is a nice extra.  The staff was really friendly, helped us out with everything and we could kayak for one hour for free. Breakfast in the morning was good.",50,874
"Been staying at this hotel everytime I come to visit Bacalar. Hotel is clean, has lagoon access, restaurant 8am-11pm, friendly staff, reliable wifi, and overall fair prices. In this last trip, I notice a lot of surprise charges such as $300. If you lose your room key (Thank God we didn't) you can't consume any food bought outside of hotel and the one that surprised me was check out. Hotel staff checks room upon leaving ...just in case you would like to take their towels? I just thought that was rude.  Another negative is that hotel sells day passes to use hotel facilities and it get very loud and busy where you can't even enjoy the hotel because every outside sitting is taken. Not sure how long will road construction last? but we experience a lot of early morning construction",40,875
 going on  at the hotel & outside road. This really damper on sleeping in.,50,875

"This place is absolutely beautiful! There are so many nice spaces to chill and enjoy the view to the best part of the lagoon: swings, hammocks, chairs, pallets. The restaurant is delicious and the service is excellent! The rooms are really nice and clean. One of the best hotels I have ever been in!",10,875
"It's a shame to pay what they charge in front of the beautiful lagoon and suffer the noise of a choker motor all morning even when we asked them please to allow us to enjoy the silence in front of nature and they told us ""that's their working time""",30,875
"We went to this hotel based on recommendations we had read online. We wanted to use their access to the lagoon and eat and drink there.  When we got there the first impression was very hostile and impolite. Only after speaking to three other employees the front man was willing to give us access. We had to pay $300 in advance that we would have to consume as a minimum.  Once we were seated on the sun chair, they were cheap plastic ones, not the wooden ones in their pictures, a server brought us the menu for drinks. We had to wait 20 minutes and call for them three times before we could order a drink. It took them another 15 minutes to bring a coke and three lemonades although it was not full.  When we wanted to eat something we had to move to the tables. As we wanted to sit down",50,875
" at a table outside (which was covered in ants btw) we were told that we couldn’t sit there and hat to move inside. So we moved to a table inside. The service was horrible, rude and bored. Our server chose to play with a garment hanger instead of fetching our drinks from the bar although we could see that they were ready for 10 mins. The food we received was mediocre at best. My salmon noodles where cold when I got them and could have benefited from salt and pepper.  The desert (Oreo cheesecake) was still frozen when we received it to the point that you needed a knife to eat. The pan de queso was burnt.  It was clear that they didn’t enjoy their job. When we left not one single employee felt the need to say good bye or to have a good day despite us walking past them and saying it.  Overall THE WORST service we have encountered in Bacalar or Mexico in general. 0/10 would recommend.",10,875
…,10,875
"Rooms were very basic, but spacious and clean. No blankets so cold at night because aircondition is always difficult to get it right. Everybody was welcome to spend a day at the garden, tables and sun beds, so there was not enough room for the hotel guests to enjoy the location and chill.  Waiters were very rude and we had to wait for ages for a drink or some food. Even taking orders could take more then half an hour.  A lot of times we could not have a drink in the garden, for unknown reasons, even though they did serve Mexicans. The location is great indeed, but besides some exceptions, the service was horrible!",50,875
"Even when it is a little slow service (get used to it as it is common in the area) everything was just wonderful. Great view, wonderful foodm and drinks. The place is really good and we will be back as we really enjoyed.",50,875
Amazing spot for a quick getaway - The lagoon is a special place especially for sunrise/sunset and if you love to kayak...  Special shout out to Roberto as  was so helpful...  I really enjoyed my stay!  Thank you,50,876
"This resort is nestled in a lush and fertile jungle setting. Conveniently located off the 307 between Chetumal and Tulum, this tropical and inspired facility is an undiscovered gem and is an absolute paradise beckoning anyone looking for a peaceful and laid back visit with the gorgeous lagoon views, the Mexican sunrise, and a truly restorative vacation. The proprietor, Roberto, and his wife are gracious and welcoming hosts eager to share their slice of heaven with their guests. Roberto was a true host in every sense of the word. He was quick to accommodate our last minute reservation and extended more kindness and consideration than I’ve ever encountered from any staff during all of my travels. Our meal was cooked to order by a local chef and  the quality was astounding. The",50,876
 property itself is uniquely designed with villas that blend perfectly into the setting and contribute to the overall beauty. Every part of the facility is well cared for and spotlessly clean. There are covered decks with loungers which extend over the lagoon and allow for spectacular views.  I highly recommend trying this place. You won’t regret it.,20,876

We stayed here for 1 night during our recent road trip around the Yucatan peninsula. It was really just an overnight stop on the journey from Calakmul to Mayakoba. The hotel is situated about 4 kilometres off the main highway down a bumpy dirt track. There was nobody at reception when we arrived and it took a few minutes to find somebody to check us in.  On the edge of the lake it should be a lovely tranquil spot but unfortunately on the afternoon we were there we had to put up with chain saws and hammering as they built a wooden platform over the lake - not really what we came here for. There also appeared to be a large number of day trippers on an organised outing who all disappeared about 4pm leaving the place almost excluively to us and the workmen.  The room itself was,50,876
" small and minimally furnished. There was no TV, no Aircon, no tea & coffee making facilities, no safe and little charm. In theory we booked a waterfront room but between our room and the water was a hedge, some palm trees and a man made area where all the sunbeds were situated so not exactly my definition of waterfront.  In theory WiFi is available in the central building but it wasn't working during our stay.  The best part of the stay from our perspective was first thing in the morning as the sun rose over the lake and everything felt tranquil and calm with just the birdsong for company. It wasn't long before the workmen turned up again to spoil it all.  Food is average and there's not a huge choice. Everything had to be paid in cash so make sure you have enough pesos with you.  The colour of the lagoon here is not as spectacular as in Bacalar itself and I'm sure there are probably better places to stay.",50,876
…,40,876
"Pros: Quiet, showers had hot water, clean, the staff was extremely friendly. Waitress Kathy came to take our dinner order while out in the lagoon so we could beat the crowd. Took care of us the rest of our stay too. All the staff made sure we were comfortable.   Cons: 30 mins away from town. Fortunately we had snacks, water, other drinks and our first aide kit. If not it probably would have not been good especially because the dirt road is extremely rough and takes about 10 mins or so to get to the hotel from the highway. Only one car can drive at a time so it was horrible when another car would come from the opposite direction there isn’t anywhere for you to go so you have to pull to the side as much as possible and hope you don’t scratch the rental car. Last con: WiFi could",40,876
" only be accessed in the checkin/restaurant area. You had no cell service what so ever in your room. Only your own cell service in the lagoon area. Also take water shoes this part of the lagoon has rocks at the bottom and most definitely wouldn’t not go in without them.   Overall cute little place with your own private villa/ bungalow. It’s a great place if you want to have a romantic getaway.  I wouldn’t do a long stay, it is off the radar and eventually you’d want to go into town. But if you want to completely whine down and get away this is the place.",50,876

I call her ""La Dama d' Hacienda"" or the ""Lady of the Manor.""  I say this because she wears many hats and she keeps everything running like a top.  Veronica is from Mexico City, and fluent in English.  She is also a working artist and that is apparent in the overall setting and the way the cabanas and the restaurant are decorated.

Then at night after she finishes up diner and cleans up, if you put some music on she will get everyone up to dance with her!    Up till now Laguna Azul has been a secret place known to people from Mexico City, campers, RV folks, some European and American travelers who wander in by chance or by mistake.  Once they get here though, they want to stay, recharge their batteries, and then get on with their travels.  This place is an oasis, but accessable to the city of Bacalar and now far from the seaside at Mahahual.    Third, Laguna Azul is very affordable and Veronica is a killer cook.  She mixes up international dishes and introduces foreigners to traditional Mexican cuisine.  She even brings tropical fruits from her orchard in a nearby village. And she periodically hires people to cut down the coconuts from the ""zocalo"" and they will machete them open for you to drink the coconut juice.

However i couldn't get to adjust the AC seems it was programmed at 24 deg which on a hot summer night is just enough to get rid of humidity and excess heat. Other than that it is a very good place for the price. ",30,878

Staff was friendly and patient, rates were reasonable, room was clean and quiet with a strong AC and parking inside the courtyard. Close to everything. We were glad to find this place and stayed two nights.",40,878
The hotel is really clean and it seems like it was built a week ago. Considering how little youre paying its worth staying a 5 minutes walk from the central square if you ask me. Also the people working there are really friendly and the rooms are cleaned every day!,50,878
"I love casa Morgan, it has a terassa facing the laguna with a stunning view. Nice communal room, in addition to a great cosy garden with hammock and a fire pit. I feel at home at casa Morgan, pepole here are awesome and its a perfect place to socialize and have fun.",50,879
"best possible location right on the laguna. the hostel has a nice terrace with a view on the lagoon and a cute garden. friendly staff. it is loud even if there is no party here due to the neighboring bar. cool place nonetheless, recommended.",50,879
A nice place to stay located right in front of the laguna. Helpful staff and atypique house ! They give good advices and has a pretty nice terrace ! I definitely recommend this place to enjoy a quiet time,50,879
"Morgan House Hostel is a great option if you’re looking for a reasonably priced hostel in a prime location. A short walk to town center, the hostel doors open to a view of the lake right. Kayak and paddle board rentals are available right across the street.   The staff are super friendly and keep the place clean and organized. Kitchen area is equipped with everything you need to make your own meals.   Loud music at the bar next door can make it difficult for light sleepers.   There’s a beautiful deck on top that overlooks the lake and makes a perfect spot to catch the sunrise over the water.",50,879
"Excellent hostel just nearby the lagoon! Everyone from the staff is really nice, you can buy cheap beer, rent a bike or just chill at the really cool rooftop with a view of the lagoon. There's a bar just next door with a really nice vibe and live music so for sure you will have fun also during the night ",50,879

"Had to check out at 9pm when I was told the restaurant next door becomes a club / bar at night and the really loud music would not stop until 2am, maybe 3.   Totally impossible to sleep.  Ok place with nice staff. Very bad mattress.  Don't expect any sleep before 2am here!",20,879
"We had such a wonderful stay here. The host is a freaking delight. The grounds are gorgeous, you can swim and kayak on a gorgeous lagoon that is private and serene. I can not say enough wonderful things about this place. If you are looking for a way to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy nature...this is the spot. My girlfriend and I will be back for sure. The highlight of our trip!",50,880
"Mis Casas is an excelent place to stay if you are looking for something quiet and sorrounded by nature. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay, so much that we have been there two times and we will probably go back!   One of the highlights is that Mis Casas has kayaks and water amenities that you can use for free! :)",50,880
"We had a fantastic “cottage” experience at Mis Casas...swimming off the dock into the  crystal clear, blue hued, warm lake, and surrounded by all the greenery of the jungle where we were treated to the sounds of many birds and creatures. Kayak trips in the lake and into small river systems were magical. Comfortable accommodations with so many windows and sky lights, giving a feeling of being outdoors. The palapa with BBQ and full kitchen facilities provided long evenings of meals, drinks, and conversation. Day trips to the Ocean, the town of Bacalar, and the Cenote Azul were less than 60 minutes away.  Host Kathy knows the area, the vegetation, and the local critters, and happily shares her love and knowledge of same. Her welcome and hospitality could not have been warmer. She",50,880

"Mis Casas offers nature lovers a wonderful retreat in the heart of the jungle. If you love listening to the birds, watching fish moving through the water, kayaking adventures and swimming in crystal clear water then Mis Casas is the perfect place for your next getaway. Kathryn is a wonderful hostess and has a wealth of knowledge about the area that she is eager to share. Mis Casas is a lovely place to spend time getting disconnected from technology while connecting with your family and friends.",50,880
"Had a wonderful two weeks, lodged in the privacy of ""Tinker"".  We enjoyed full access and use of the central screened-in palapa, replete with kitchen, dining table and most inviting hammock.  Relaxing in the beauty of the jungle and gardens, together with swimming in picturesque Laguna Bacalar from Mis Casas' docks was lovely and refreshing.  The mix of independent living and management's care and support was ideal.  Mis Casas is ideally situated to offer a nice mix of outings to Pueblo Bacalar, Chetumal, Mahahual and various Mayan ruins in the area, alternating with leisurely days at home at Mis Casas.",50,880
"My third time to visit.  An exceptionally relaxing and renewing destination. The jungle tone is maintained. The Lake of Seven Colours is a beautiful limestone, underground, fed lake that is wonderful to be on, in or viewing. Mis Casas is clean, well appointed with all utensils for cooking and self sufficiency. Katarina is instructive and able to be helpful or part of the background. She is knowledgeable about the ecological area and the local tourist attractions. A real bonus is the common area  palapa which serves as a lakeside kitchen, a dining room seating up to 15 and a lounge. It is equipped with a nature library and games for the whole family. Mis Casas is all around wonderful with the opportunity to customize your jungle experience. I’ll be back again!",50,880
"Set into the jungle with lake front, Mis Casas is a beautiful and friendly little piece of paradise. The lake is a turquoise beauty to swim, kayak and canoe. Accomodations blend in with nature, are comfortable, large and beautiful. A haven for the senses.",50,880
"This is glamping-at-its-best. We keep coming back to this jungle oasis for so many reasons, and we are always amazed that it's always better than we remember. We come here because there are minimal modern services and yet we still get flush toilets, hot showers, easy cooking facilities, and canoes or kayaks to rent. In exchange for turning off our cell phones and laptops, we get an intimate up close experience of the friendliest jungle, multiple daily swims in the soft clean lake water, warmth and kind welcomes from the hostess, deep delicious naps in the hammocks, and we always meet the most delightful people dropping in for a meal or a visit. We loved being here as a couple, and as parents it's been even better. A child of any age who can disconnect from electronics will have",40,880
"Stayed here for one night, showed randomly with no reservation. Was accomodated  in a shared room with bunk beds. Shared rooms are inside a wooden 'Cabin' with bunkbeds,  with a shared  terrace that offers side views of the lake. The location with access to the lake was great. Some kayak and SUP tours are available (took neither there).  Basic breakfast. I was really lucky as the one night I stayed I was the only person in the room. So, that really makes a difference.  The day I left, a large group arrived with camping tents so I guess they allow people to camp as well on the 'garden lawn'.  Bathroom was basic. Shower could be improved with hot water. Basic accomodation for a basic price. The staff was friendly and helpful. They had dogs that were also friendly. Location: within",30,881

We didn’t stay at this hostel but we booked their sailing tour around the lagoon and it was amazing. They offer three tours a day and we did the evening tour 3-6:30pm and it was nothing short of perfect. Everything was so relax and although I was the only traveller who spoke English they translated as much as they could for me. We stopped at all the major sights in the lagoon where we could swim and take pictures. This was such a relaxing trip around the lagoon of 7 colours I would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Bacalar. Not to mention the price was amazing!,20,881
The place is decent  but noisy not confortable  no locker in the room  no toilet in the room... mattresses rolled in plastic wrap (very uncomfortable) And they charge 15€/17usd for a bed in a dorm!Terrible quality/price ratio.Should cost half at least.,30,881
"I'm not picky about where I stay so enjoyed my stay based on the water front location and it's proximity to the square, in terms of how the hostel is run it's a pretty terrible operation. There was diarrhea for three days in two of three toilets found outside and a terrible smell of dog in the other set of toilets, staff are unhelpful, none I met could speak any English and pretty sure one is high all the time. You pay a lot of money to stay here yet have to pay every time to fill your water and when I asked for a bin bag to put some dirty clothes in they said I couldn't have one. Beds are hard and the AC in my room drips on my bed.",40,881
"I LOVED Bacalar so it kept me from realizing at first the issues this place has. There are currently two dogs there in dire need of veterinary car and, more simply, a bath. They smell terrible and at least one always likes to hang out in the bathroom. So you get to smell dog smell while you're in the bathroom. One was in there when I took a shower. It was gross. One is bleeding from its paw and drips blood everywhere. They both have open sores and scratch all the time (obviously flea-ridden). The staff was very friendly and helpful. The owner herself is unfriendly, will not speak unless you speak to her first (makes you wonder why she went into hospitality) and the back of the toilet has never been cleaned. When I got there I had to clean the bathroom myself just so i could",10,881
" stand it. It wasn't filthy but it was way too dirty for my taste and I'm not very picky. Hair on the floor, mud, dirty toilet etc.  Great things: location - right on the lagoon and close to the center of town; staff - very friendly and helpful.",10,881

Wifi was great, AC worked amazing, quiet and beautiful. Kids loved exploring and jumping off see ock into the water. Marissa was amazing with booking us in a crazy state and welcoming us in later that same day. Very accommodating!",50,882
"With my family, we rented one of Ginny's villas for 2 weeks. It was gorgeous. The lake is beautiful, calm, the plants and flowers produce a stunning view we could enjoy from the balcony. Down the stairs, we had access to a palapa to feel the breeze, swim and relax in a hammock. The kids enjoyed the kayaks. Ginny and her team are most welcoming, always willing to help. Ginny also has a treasure library of thousands of DVDs we could borrow to watch movies at night. The villa is comfortable. There is everything you need to cook, warm water (although with the heat we didn't really use it, preferring cold showers), a fan and good beds and screens to have mosquito-free nights. It was simply a very relaxful and serene vacation for us. thank you Ginny.",50,882
"Where to begin to describe our visit to Pehaltun. Ginny was an incredible host who was so flexible and accommodating. In fact, we were supposed to stay elsewhere but unfortunately our host was unwell, however our original hosts got in touch with Ginny to ask if we could stay. Last minute, she let us stay in her house, which was super comfortable and Ginny made us feel so at home as if we'd known each other for years.   Furthermore, Ginny has some of the best recommendations for places to eat in Bacalar. On our first night we went out to dinner with Ginny to Bote De Leche, which has the most amazing garlic bread you will ever taste!   At Pehaltun, you also have access to your own private dock which is on the property. This was an incredible addition to property. It was far enough",50,882
" out that you could dive off the dock and you can also chill  in the hammocks to cool off from the Mexican heat. Ginny also put us in touch with some amazing people from the community who were able to take us wake-boarding. Basically, Ginny knows pretty much everybody in town and connects you to whatever you need.   You even have access to the canoes and kayaks which Ginny has on the property, we decided to take the canoe out on many occasions for a sunrise paddle and even to El Rancho's for lunch which is 15/20 minute canoe from the property.   Ginny was so kind and let us stay an extra night even though this was not planned. This was the best part to our trip to Mexico and we are definitely coming back to Bacalar in the future and will hope to see Ginny again and most definitely to taste one of her amazing grilled cheeses.   Thank you so much for letting us stay and I recommend to all to go and check this place out for yourselves.",50,882
…,50,882
"This was the most beautiful place we stayed at during our road trip around Mexico. So peaceful and relaxing but with your own car you are in downtown Bacalar within minutes. Beautiful garden, your own dock and hammocks down by the lake, a terrace overlooking the turquoise water and a stylish „villa“ with everything you need for a pleasant stay. Ginny is a charming and generous host who helped us a lot when our baby got sick. This is probably the best option when in Bacalar! ",50,882
"Pehaltun I placed 4km outside the town in the jungle.  Pehaltun is not a luxurious place but the place is absolutely fantastic and the host, Ginny, is very caring and friendly.   We stayed here for 1 week with our children (3 and 6yr).  We loved the privacy and nature that this place had to offer.  Go to the lake in the morning for a morning swim while enjoying your coffee and the Magnificat sunrise.   Pehaltun got my best recommendation. ",50,882
"Our stay in Villa Pehaltun was amazing. My husband booked a 3 night stay in the Palapa for our family . The view from the Palapa is gorgeous and fortunatly it was a bit windy during our stay so the breeze kept the Palapa fresh 24/7. We would get up very early every morning to go to Bacalar local produce market to get fresh fruit and other goodies, go back to the villa and have our private breakfast in our terrace. The view is breathtaking so we thought it would have been a shame to not use it. Our hosts Lise and Steve made great recommendations of the sightseeing excursions but we enjoyed the premises so much, we didn't want to leave. Our 9 year old daughter LOVED playing with the dogs at all times, she even had a swim with the youngest puppy. We used the canoe several times to",50,882
" explore on our own, it was kind of windy but we still enjoyed it.  The dock us very nice and we were lucky to be the only ones in the Villa for the first 2 days so it was just for the 3 of us and even after that, we never crashed into the other guests because their are always other things to do. Sunrises are amazing a if you go a bit further in with the kayaks or canoe you get to see the sunset, just majestic.  Lise and Steve were super nice and everything is set just right in the Palapa so you feel comfortable at all times. I highly recommend Villa Pehaltun and we are definitely coming back!",50,882

"We had the best time!! The garden and the Laguna are amazing...and Pedro was so helpful and made our stay even more enjoyable. ""El cielo"" is an apartment full of art (Yolanda is a very talented painter) and with a stunning view. We could not believe all the lovely details in the apartment and having THIS TERRACE. The place is too wonderful to make trips to other places. Just stay in the water and enjoy nature's beauty! The town of Bacalar is cute, too with some lovely breakfast and dinner places. Since a colleague recommended this place I haven't read other reviews. This is why unfortunately we did not know of Pedro's cooking skills - but we will definitely come back anyway and try them next time :-)!!   Muchas gracias por todo!!  Micha and Vanessa",50,883
"I was there with my family, and I most say: it is a wonderful place to go for relax, recover, family time, and if it is the case, romantic. We had two apartments with everything needed, specially for cooking. The decoration and the small details over the place were perfect. One of the apartments had a huge terrace were we had breakfast, saw the sunrise and the moon: Also the space for cooking and eating inside was perfect and with a lot of space. One must be clear that this place is not a luxury hotel, you are in the middle of the jungle, getting there is a road road (max. 2 km from the highway). It is perfect if you want to disconnect. It is also ecofriendly, so the electricity is from the sun of the day. More sun more hot water :-) we couldn´t use hair dryer which is not",50,883
" necessary in the jungle, but it is important that you (reader) are aware that it is  not a city, it is a house hidden in the jungle next to a beautiful lagoon. For me, it was a great place to recover, the owners gave us perfect privacy and they gave us support and tips for everything we needed. We could have massage sessions there with really good massage therapist from the region. And the possibility of temazcal was there. Last but not least. The beautiful view to the lagoon and the possibility of swimming in the lagoon right in the backyard was also so nice.  I definitely recommend this place, which is in the middle of the jungle if you are looking for a space for you, your family and/or partner, to disconnect from a city and connect with yourself and the nature.",50,883

"We rented the penthouse with king bed.  Extremely spacious with extra queen bed, dining table and sitting area.  Very large sun deck overlooking the magical lagoon.  Private dock and no close neighbors....perfect for a swimsuit optional swim in the most gorgeous water that you have ever experienced. The owners are very hospitable and for a small fee, they serve you breakfast and dinner in your suite.  Feels like you are staying at your own home.   It's an eco friendly property with solar lights and plenty of hot water.  No a/c, but with  the fan, we slept like babies:) Make sure to ask Youlanda for the exact direction on google maps, as Waze sent us the wrong way on a long trek through the jungle road.  The actual road is about half mile from the main highway and is ok if you go",10,883
 slow.   Bring a cooler with ice and your favorite drinks and snacks as there is no freezer here.  No problem though.....we enjoyed making our own martinis every night.

"I second everything the below review said. We experienced a very unclean location (staying also in El cielo) when we complained about the lack of hot water the owner got very nasty. This is not a place you want to stay at, and certainly not pay for your stay. They cover all the defects up by saying it is eco friendly but in reality it is an amateurish set up, badly maintained by people who are just out for your money. They have 2 chihuahuas that yelp day and night. For internet use we were told by their son to stand in the corner closest to the main building (where the owners lived) since that's the only place with a WiFi router. No extender and therefore no decent internet. No functions fans either. Save yourself money and frustration and go somewhere else",50,883
"Having read all the positive reviews we were super excited about our stay at Casa Aqabal. Unfortunately we knew had made a mistake from the moment we arrived.   The road to the property is dodgy and difficult to get down, but it's not impossible if you drive slowly and do it in day light. Just be aware that you're pretty far from the town and any shops so arrive fully stocked and happy to stay stationary for your whole stay.   Yes, Yolanda and Pedro seem like the loveliest hosts, greeting you with big smiles and seemingly excited to have you stay. However we realised quickly that this is all pantomime.  We stayed in El Cielo (the most experience option). The room has stunning views of the lake, nicely decorated and very big. However, our nights here were the absolute worst",50,883
" nights sleep either of us have ever experienced. The room was invested with endless giant ants and flying beetles. With no mosquito net & the electricity cutting out (hence the tiny fan above the bed not working ), sleeping was an impossibility.  To add to this, the entire property felt very unclean & uncomfortable. Very dusty and covered in dead insects.   Yes the meals are good but not mind blowing like others have mentioned. Plus they only offer you water, so pretty expensive for a simple home cooked meal. Breakfast and dinner are served in the hosts flat, so you're eating your meals with other guests and Yolanda - who bans mobile phones and forces you to interact with each other. Obviously this is great if you're in the mood and want that sort of an evening...but for it to be mandatory is just odd!   We knew that we couldn't stay here for the full three nights as it was just so uncomfortable, so decided to leave early in the morning after night two. I had discussed this with Yolanda who said it wasn't a problem at all. I even offered to pay for any of the groceries they may have bought for our meals, which she said wasn't necessary.   When we came to leaving, the sweet smiley Yolanda had been replaced with a nasty, aggressive woman who was clearly ready for a show down! She said we had to pay for half of the night's fee for cancelling. Now, I 100% understand and appreciate this logic but why wasn't this mentioned to us before hand? It hadn't been written anywhere but ultimately, why did they need to communicate this in such a hostile tone. Also, it's all cash only, which one can only assume that is their opportunistic way of tax dodging and demanding more money! We just wanted to get out and were not in the mood for an argument (she had told us many stories of previous arguments she had gotten into with previous guests she hated. She had also told us that she has a bad temper and gets really angry quickly). So anyway, we  paid up and left...   So whilst the lake is really, really beautiful, this B&B is definitely not the best way to experience it. There are a load of better quality/priced places to stay which are also closer to town. This is like a super expensive yet low quality hostel. It's by far the worst place we stayed during our Yacatan road trip. Yolanda's excuse for everything is 'this is an eco lodge', and yes we fully understand how eco lodges work, we have stayed in many of them before, but this one is just the pits! Avoid it.   ",50,883

The beautiful lagoon of Bacalar.  It's long 4 hours drive from playa but it's worth it.  Take a tour boat with swimming in the lake.  Than relax with lunch in a small hostel.  This area is still beautiful and untouched by massive tourism.  Beautiful place. ,50,893
"Great views, friendly people and really great place to relax. You can be social or just by your self. We stayed there couple of days during our trip from Belize to Playa del Carmen and the lake view and kayaking were just the things that made our trip perfect. This place is not in the center but taxis are very cheap and you can also walk if you have time and good shoes. Couple of times the water run out but there is plenty of clear water in the lake ;)",40,893
"Far from town but nice spot,  friendly hosts.  No ac but breeze was nice.  View from room was amazing.  Wish we had more time to spend here. No keys were given to lock the room when you left but we didn't feel that was necessary as everyone was very nice and the place had a locked gate. ",40,893
If you stay here you can expect a family owned business with nice staff and cute rooms with thatched roof. Unfortunately the cabanas dont offer a beach front or access to the water. Breakfast could be ordered for some extra pesos. If you stay here a car would be an advantage since the place is a little outside from bacalar and places to eat/drink are 5 car min away ,30,894
"This is a quiet spot about 10 mins walk down a very main busy road before getting to the outskirts of Bacalar. It is a small, family run establishment. Staff were friendly, helpful and patient. There were amazing views of this stunningly beautiful lake and the cabanas were very cute. Breakfast was done to order in the morning. Factor in the cost of taxis when booking, as it is not a nice walk to town plus there is little to do at the cabanas during the evening. It is a pretty and peaceful place to rest up.",40,894
"The hotel is somewhat far away from downtown Bacalar, making it necessary to take a $30-50 peso taxi each time you need to move. There are no nearby restaurants or stores. It is too secluded from Bacalar. The attention from the owners is ok, nothing too special. Breakfasts are expensive if you take cost-benefit in consideration.",30,894
"El hotel iguana rana está en segunda línea frente a la laguna, al lado del cenote cocalitos, que es genial para ir a pasar la tarde, y del cenote azul.

It was nothing like the picture. We got a banana or a apple, and some toast.  Other hotels did not offer this. We were disappointed,  Tea was amazing!",40,898
This is a cute hotel with big rooms 10 minutes from the center. The tasty breakfast is Müsli with tropical fruit and some toast with Marmelade. Unfortunately there’s no fridge in the rooms but the staff is very friendly and helpful. We booked a lagoon tour via the hotel and had a nice tour of 2 hours with pickup from the hotel.  The water was always warm and there are fans and aircon in the rooms. ,40,898
"When we arrived at this hotel to check in, we were more than a little disappointed at the appearance of the hotel from the street. However, once we got situated, we found it to be a great little hotel.  It's not beach-front, and is a fairly good walk to the town center, but other than its' location, the Moon Lagoon is a wonderful spot to spend your lodging pesos. We found it to be exceptionally clean and all of the staff that we had occasion to interact with were friendly, attentive, and handled all of our questions and issues with courtesy and very quickly.  Violet, Miguel, and the rest of the staff are all fantastic hosts!

"We booked two night here for us and some friends. We knew it wasn’t on the lagoon, however it was lacking so much more than that. The rooms are simple, that would be fine if the water worked, if it didn’t have huge gaps between the door and the floor. Only a sheet and two pillows, I need a blanket as my husband likes the room cold, the ac took forever to get working as well. The kicker, we decided we wanted to be on the water as getting access can be difficult, so we booked another hotel, we had already paid upfront for both nights, we asked if they could give us even one night refund but no. They fought and said they absolutely could not give us any money back what’s so ever. We are extremely disappointed in how we were treated. Unless you are ok with very basic (at best)",50,898

"We were going to a wedding in a small town inside from Bacalar  and there was no place to stay, we had no car and we needed a place to get a shower and get ready.  They don't take credit cards they have room with AC for $600 pesos and with a sealing fan for  $400 pesos   I should not complain it had 2 king size beds,AC and shower with warm water.   It has many rooms and a swimming pool. You need a car to move around here if you go far taxis will try to charge a lot.  Decided not to take pics. ",30,901
Nous avons dormi à l'hôtel Dana Express dans la nuit du 22 au 23 février 2014 et en avons tiré une grande satisfaction.  L'hôtel peut sembler être un motel de passe au premier coup d'œil mais il n'en est rien. L'omniprésence de la couleur rose de l'endroit peut porter à confusion à ce sujet.  L'hôtel est à environ 3 km du centre-ville sur la route principale qui mène à Chetumal en venant de Limones.  Il est sur votre gauche si vous venez de cette direction et il est impossible de le manquer.  Ce n'est pas un hôtel de grand luxe certes mais il est très convenable et à un tarif très raisonnable de surcroît.  Nous avons payé 400 pesos ( $33 dollars canadiens) sans possibilité de négocier le prix à la baisse mais j'ai tout de même essayé.   Nous avions la chambre 128 qui était,40,901

"Die Lage ist hervorragend, nur 4 min. zu Fuß von der Lagune entfernt. Der Campingplatz ist der Vorhof einer sehr lieben, bemühten Familie. Wir wurden gleich mit Kaffee empfangen, den wir gemütlich bei einem Gitarrenständchen trinken konnten und das Zelt wurde uns auch aufgebaut.  Die Zelte sind nicht schlecht und mit dünnen Matratzen ausgelegt, welche überraschend bequem waren. Auch die Sanitären Anlagen waren ok.  Kleiner Kritikpunkt war das Frühstück, welches für das Geld recht bescheiden war. Auch der Hof hätte etwas weniger kahl sein dürfen.   Großer Pluspunkt: Die Familie war unglaublich hilfsbereit.

"We had a great stay with Ximbal Camping. We originally booked in for one night but decided to stay an extra night.   The tents are great and come with everything you need.(We grabbed another two mats for comfort). There were just 6 tents so it was quiet at night and not over crowded.  They offer breakfast, pancakes with fresh fruit or eggs/toast also with fruit. Really nice food.  Its only a 2 min walk to the main square and 5min walk to the Laguna.  The family are lovely too!",40,902
"We were looking for a place to find the stromatolites and accidentally ended up at Panto-Ha... and stayed three nights, 7 kilometres from Bacalar towards Chetumal, at the end of a 1200 metres dirt road (allow 10 minutes by car). This location is a paradise, in the forest, directly at the Laguna. Three cabins are available for 400 pesos/night each. No power (except for lights till about 10 pm from a generator), no running water (except for the - clean - communal toilets). The cabins offer two double beds, space, a verandah, a view and 'an experience to be in a sort of Mayan house' because the cabins are built on poles and have the typical Mayan grass roofs. If you go to Panto-Ha ask for a cabin with mosquito screens and you might be happy to take some mozzy coils for the evenings",40,904

"We were supposed to stay in a room with lake view at Casa Ichkabal. This was not available once we arrived, which can happen of course. We asked the receptionist if we could still cancel, cause we wanted to look for a hotel that did have a room at the lake - which is the main reason people visit Bacalar. 'Yes' he said, and free of charge. We left, booked another hotel and waited for the cancellation. This never happened, a refund was never received, the hotel didn't reply to all our emails and is not picking up the phone. Don't tell us we can cancel if you're not intending to refund our money!!",10,906

De muren waren bedekt met schimmel en de geur in de kamer was niet uit te houden, zelfs bedlinnen rook alsof het jaren niet gewassen was. We hebben een verschrikkelijke nacht gehad. Nadat we hier over hebben geklaagd heeft de manager van het hotel het op een verkeerde en niet professionele manier afgehandeld, en zeker niet opgelost. We hebben hiervoor geen vergoeding en/of excuses voor ontvangen. We raden het hotel zeker niet aan!",10,907

There was no water in the little pool.  The staff was friendly and the rooms still looked fine, but we decided to go to a different hotel.

There are a few different hang out spots so people can spread out and it felt like we had the space to our selves. The food at the hotel is great and at a reasonable price for hotel food.

The rooms need to be redone, get rid of the ants that are everywhere! the public areas are sad and need to be gutted and redesigned.  The hotel has incredible potential but lacks ""care"".

"I will start by saying this hotel was pretty good in cancelling my reservation and returning all my money except for one night stay. I am rating them a 2 star because the rooms are not what they appear online and have some mis-information and was an overly run down place we found.  For example when i did the booking on booking.com, it stated a king size bed. The picture showed this beautiful room with lots of room and a view and private balcony. This was not the case as only room has a king and it was not our room. The original room would have barely fit our suitcases, and certainly no king size bed. So then they upgraded us to a junior suite (what a joke), yes a little bigger, better view, but no balcony and two beds. We pushed them to create a bigger bed. Then we noticed the",10,909

Not just from an overnight, but seems like no attention has been given by anyone, not sure what the cleaners are doing besides making the beds. Between the owner, manager, cleaning staff, front desk, and a guy trying to sell us tours, obviously no one cares about the condition of the property.  It is too bad as the location and the potential of this property is significant. And I am not a tourist, we live in Mexico and this is the worse I have seen in awhile.

The outdoor furniture is also very moldy and/or broken as are most of the kayaks that you can rent. Breakfast was supposed to be included but over 3 days they ran our of food (someone hadn't gone shopping yet) and one morning the coffee and milk was locked in the reception office and none of the am staff had the key.

Also, I know the hotel cant help all the dogs around, but if I had a hotel in a neighbourhood were 20 dogs would howl and bark all night (litteraly, ALL NIGHT), I would go for a bit thicker walls and double glass so they dont keep you up all night (besides the noisy staff).

Laura is very dishonest and hungry for money. I stayed a night and I see how she is constantly accusing someone of missing things and monitoring her cameras. She is disgusting person who cares only about money and when I checked out she insisted the deposit of 500 pesos goes to her employees which she refused to return.   She will find ways to keep your deposit. whether from her bike or kayak or towels.  It is sad and she complaints about her employees stealing from her.,10,911
"Our experience with this establishment was less than pleasant. I inquired on a Sunday about the policy for no children ages 0-12 listed in the house rules. I have found that many of the hostels list this option because they do not want babies/toddlers  in the dorms and the option is an all/nothing choice given by Airbnb to hosts. As I suspected my 9 year old daughter was welcome in the hostel as indicated by the message we received back from the hostel the following morning. They stated they ""we will be waiting for you"" in response. Upon receiving this message I sent the money via Airbnb and we left for our ADO bus in Tulum.

When we asked why we were given no explanation - not ""we overbooked, miscommunication, etc."" just a simple ""your reservation was cancelled"". They pointed in either direction and said there are hostels on this road you can try but likely everything is booked. Mind you I still have 3 children and a grandma who are tired/hot from a long day of travel who now have nowhere to sleep. Then the one worker states he may have a friend who may have a room. If I want to see it he will take me. I agreed because honestly what else can I do? So we get on the four wheeler (he has no helmet for me, only him) and we ride back to town. We arrive at a property with 3 cabins on it. I ask to see inside and am quickly told ""No"" because I am ""dirty"" thanks to be driven through each and every puddle on the way up the road. They state one night will be 2000 pesos. I argue that we reserved 2 nights at Zazil. They countered with 4600 pesos/2 nights. I was blown away. I said just take me back. The driver then states he is unable to do that! I lost my cool and began yelling and pacing, finally he agreed to return me to Zazil to gather my family and things. Upon return we grabbed our stuff and hiked out of there as quick as possible. When we did find new accommodations I checked my email and had not received anything to cancel!

Hotel genre motel le long d'une grosse route. Sans ame. Piscine certes mais pas engageante. Genre relais routier plus qu'hotel. Propre mais sommaire.  Se situe a 1km de la pkace principale de Bacalar. Pas de possibilite de petit dejeuner.,20,914

"Después de que otro hotel no respeto nuestra reservación, el mirador fue una buena opción, cumple con todo lo necesario para una estancia comoda. La vista a la laguna no es realmente impresionante si te quedas en las habitaciones del primer piso pero la atención es excelente.  (Olvidamos una bocina y nos la guardaron hasta que pudimos recogerla muchos días después.) ",50,916
"Un hotel accesible en tránsito y en costo, te puedes desplazar a diversos puntos de bacalar y otras atracciones. El costo es accesible para viajar en familia, la atención muy buena, al pendiente de tus necesidades",40,917
"Me encanta ir a éste sitio, la atención de todos es maravillosa! Las habitaciones son cómodas, me dejan hospedarme con mis mascotas (2perritos pequeñitos) La parte de la laguna no es la mejor, nunca me quedo a nadar ahí lo que es lamentable pero me encanta el personal tan amable.",50,917
"Está a unos minutos del pueblo pero con una excelente ubicación a la orilla de la Laguna, con excelente vista y no tienes más que dar unos pasos para nadar. Las habitaciones son pequeñas y sencillas pero el precio es bueno. Te recomiendo probar la pechuga a la plancha. Es un lugar atendido familiarmente por lo que hay confianza. Es el segundo hotel construido en Bacalar y si dices que los conociste por Chango Chilango.com te hacen descuento.",40,917

"Already the booking was annoying. After having paid the room, I received a message in Spanish that I had to pay the room again. Upon my request to send me the message in English and informing the hotel that I paid already, I received the same mail again... this time in English. A direct contact was unanswered and only an escalation via the booking site could solve the issue. Then the arrival at the hotel: dirty, disgusting linens, stinking toilet, dirty floor and walls. Also the air conditioning had no remote control - and I did not receive one from the hotel even after requesting it. Don't come here, except if you had to stay on the road.",10,918
"Even before our arrival,we received several misleading mails about the payment status, all in Spanish, despite our requests to communicate in Englisch. We werde asked to pay again and resolved this issue only by contacting booking.com. When we arrived, the place was dirty, awfully smelly owing to a brocken sink and hot as the  AC remote control was missing and couldn't be retrieved. Charging €75 for that service is a complete rip off.",10,918
"I went with my best friend's family and my boyfriend we occupied 4 rooms. The hotel needs maintenance but if you're not picky or sensitive about old beds, ok rooms, etc this hotel will do the trick. There are some rooms with lagoon view which is awesome! They have a restaurant and the food is good so no need to go out anywhere else for food. We were expecting to rent canoes but they didn't have available so that was a bummer. The hotel is pretty close to the Cenote Azul and Bacalar town which has more activities on the lagoon, you can visit the fort and they have good restaurants too. We had a great time :)",30,918
"My husband and I stayed here from 12/31 - 1/2. It isn't newly constructed, but has been well maintained. There's an onsite restaurant, which has a great ceviche and excellent fresh fruit juices. You can have food delivered to your room as well. Family owned and operated and excellent service. Hugo speaks great English if you're rusty on your Spanish. Pool was nice, although we didn't use it seeing as the reason we were in Bacalar was for the laguna. The view is spectacular! The longer we stayed, the more we loved it there and appreciated it. The highlight for me was renting one of their canoes (150 pesos for two hours) and canoeing accross the laguna (about 2 km) to the mangroves. We found an inlet to a small cove where we explored, drank from a coconut, and relished in the",40,918

Y bien tonta que dejó su trapo de limpieza encima de la cama, por eso nos dimos cuenta sino ni chequeamos las carteras antes de irnos del lugar.  Los dueños no se han responsabilizado de nada, incluso ponian en duda nuestro testimonio.

This reservation was made via booking, they even told booking that I wanted to cancel the reservation. Communication with the hotel is very bad, they answer whenever they want, they just ignore your question and ask for pre payment so they can keep the money and they are not friendly at all.",10,920
"Würde nur der Abschnitt vom Garten bis zum See bewertet, dann läge die Bewertung dieser Unterkunft ganz weit oben. Denn die Lage direkt am See, mit zugehörigem Steeg ist wunderschön. Doch leider wird aus diesem Bonus nichts gemacht.  Die Zimmer sind kahl und überhaupt nicht freundlich eingerichtet. Zudem lässt der Eigentümer die Zimmer verkommen. Die Schiebetüren des Schranks funktionierten ebensowenig, wie die Fliegengittertür zum Eingang des Zimmers. Ein Duschvorhang sucht man vergebens. DIe Gefahr eines Stromschlages besteht an den Steckdosen, da diese aus der Wand hängen.  Die Zimmer liegen jeweils an den Ecken des Hauses. Das bedeutet, insbesondere im Erdgeschoß, das die zwei vorhandenen Fenster mit Vorhängen zugezogen werden müssen, sofern nicht alle Gäste die zum See",10,920
" gehen in das Zimmer blicken können. Es sei denn man möchte beim Schlafen beobachtet werden.   Das Personal ist unfreundlich und nicht zuvorkommend, wie wir es bei unserer Tour durch Mexiko kennen lernen durften. Zudem muss das Zimmer in Bar und im voraus bezahlt werden. Kreditkarten werden nicht akzeptiert. Da wir zwei Nächte gebucht hatten, verständigten wir uns darauf am kommenden Tag zu bezahlen, nachdem wir am ATM Geld abgeholt hätten. Nachdem wir Abends vom Essen zurück kamen wurde auf die sofortige Bezahlung des Zimmers beharrt. Eine Diskussion half nicht weiter, so dass wir um 23 Uhr nochmals los sind, um Geld abzuheben.  Einen Schlüssel für das Tor oder der Tür zum Zugang des Hotels wird nicht ausgegeben. Damit ist ein selbständiges Betreten und verlassen des Hotelgeländes nicht möglich. Es hat den Charakter eines Gefängnisses.  Im Hotel wird für den Preis von 100 Pesos ein Frühstück angeboten, welches wir am ersten Morgen probierten. Es gab Rührei mit Schinken und Knorpel. Aber wir hatten wenigstens etwas zu lachen, als der Kaffee kam. Zwei Tassen heißes Wasser und Kaffeepulver zum einrühren! Am nächsten Morgen haben wir im Ort hervorragen gefrühstückt. Übrigens auch für 100 Pesos.  Noch ein Tipp: Sollte wirklich jemand ein Zimmer dort buchen wollen, dass Hotel hat weder eine Adresse noch befindet sich irgenwo ein Schild, was auf diese Unterkunft hinweist. Wir haben das Hotel nach etwa 45 Minuten suche nur gefunden, weil wir in der Reservierungsbestätigung ein Bild des oberen Teils des Hotels hatten und so das Hotel fanden. Auf die Frage warum am Hotel kein Namensshild angebracht wurde, wurde uns geantwortet der Eigentümer wolle dies nicht. Es kann sich jeder seine eigenen Gedanken machen, warum jemand ein Hotel nicht nach außen kenntlich machen möchte.",10,920
"I stayed in this hostel for two nights and had a very good stay. I would rate the hostel 4 stars if the location would be a bit better. It is just too far from the center of Bacalar, so you need to walk quite for to the center.  The hostel itself is very nice and the employees are very helpful and welcoming. I stayed in the 4 bedroom which has two bunk beds, AC, lockers and a few, but enough plugs. The beds were good and the room is big enough. They also have some stuff to do a bit of a work-out.   They have a common area in and outside the hostel as well as a small but sufficient pool!  The WiFi works good enough for videocalling.

The room was beautiful and the house stylishly decorated right down to the turquoise mandala dishes and cups!the garden with the hammocks was a great touch and nice for relaxing.   The only thing that was a little disappointing is that the photo says ‘bed and breakfast’ and the listing which we paid for stated ‘breakfast provided’ - however this is not the case. There is indeed a cafe attached to the house but usually when it says breakfast provided, it is included in the price and not available to buy. Anyhow, beautiful house and great location just a few steps from the lagoon.",40,923

La cocina es una mesa, te prestan platos y vasos pero se los llevan a lavar y a veces no los regresan, entonces los podrás usar solo una vez. Todo está retirado por lo que tienes que anticipar tus compras. Lleva mucho repelente...mucho. Te prestan kataks, y estar a ldo de l Laguna donde pasar un buen rato es lo mejor.

"Whilst travelling through Bacalar this January, my fiance and I, stumbled across this beautiful campsite on the shores of Laguna de los Siete Colores. It has such a secluded and intimate atmosphere with stunning flora, and the occasional hummingbird buzzing past. It has to be the most romantic place I have ever been to. Perfect for any honeymoon!  We chose to stay in the Cabañas literally centimetres from the waters edge which soothed us to sleep with the gentle lapping of waves on the bank. We chartered a catamaran and spent an afternoon sailing around the lagoon, visiting cenotes and the bird islands with Captain Marcos, and returned to a delicious Ceviche, prepared by his lovely wife Alejandra. Between them they made our stay so completely stress free and relaxing, we decided",50,925
" to stay longer than we had planned.  They are also an encyclopedia of local and regional knowledge and helped us with renting a car to explore a much wider area, which is awash with Mayan archaeological sites and stunning natural wonders. The campsite is around a 25 minute walk from the main town centre, which has everything you could need, as a base for further local exploring.  If you are looking for serene beauty and relaxation for your weary travelling feet then look no further. Hats off to Alejandra and Marcos for making paradise feel like our home!  Pros... To many to list Cons... Not good for wheelchairs",50,925

"Advertised itself as being close to town, it was in fact 2 km, this would have been alright if it was a nice walk however it’s a choice between walking along a main road or down an unlit, dodgy-looking  dirt track. It also says there is breakfast which isn’t true at all, we were looked at as if we were mad when we asked for it. A washing machine is also advertised however you have to pay for this. The staff were v friendly however which was the main reason behind this being 3 stars not less.",30,927
"Estuvo muy tranquila la estancia, la familia que se encarga de cuidar y atender el hotel es muy amable y muy atenta, el lugar cuenta con un acceso privado a la laguna, es simplemente un terreno con una palapa y tienes que caminar un poco para poder accesar, de ahí en fuera todo se encuentra bien, la habitación donde nos hospedamos estaba limpia, contaba con agua fría y caliente en la ducha, no hay tv's, sí cuenta con wifi, aire acondicionado, el desayuno que incluye te lo preparan al momento y hay opción de rentar bicicletas, en una habitación nos pudimos quedar cuatro personas.

We hebben ook zeker ‘s avonds genoten van ons terras, waar we lekker wat eten hebben laten bezorgen. Het personeel is allervriendelijkst, gastvrij en behulpzaam. De locatie is net iets buiten het centrum, maar daardoor erg rustig gelegen. Met de fiets kun je de drukte binnen no-time opzoeken. De eigenaar bood aan om ons te brengen naar het busstation nadat wij informatie vroegen over een taxi. Echt super lief! Al met al hebben wij enorm genoten van deze van fijne plek.",40,928

Pas de service donc bien penser à tout avant ( pas de ptit dej etc) Le WiFi ne fonctionne que sur la terrasse commune en bas des marches   Cependant très jolie vue,20,929
"El lugar es muy lindo. Está justo a lado de un cenote, así que tiene tanto zonas profundas como otras muy bajas.   Cuenta con hamacas, columpios y kayaks de uso libre.   La habitación es pequeña pero agradable. No obstante, hay dos cosas que no me permiten dejarle más de 3 puntos de calificación y es que la limpieza de la habitación era muy pobre.   La mesa parecía que jamás había visto un paño pues le limpiamos y habían restos de comida, dulce y tierra. La tazas de café que dejaron, estaban usadas, con restos se café y hasta lápiz labial.   El baño despedía mal olor y la alfombrilla de este parecía no haberse lavado en mucho tiempo.   En general es un lugar lindo (aunque un poco alejado del centro) pero la limpieza de las habitaciones debe mejorar. Por fuera todo impecable.",30,929

"Nous y avons passé 2 nuits début janvier après les fêtes. La propriété est située à l'extérieur du centre village de Bacalar (5 minutes en voiture) mais est en bordure du lac, on a donc un accès direct avec un plongeoir, 2 hamacs sur l'eau, 2 balançoires sur l'eau. La propriété donne même sur un des cenotes qui fait partie du lac, bref, c'est super pour accéder au lac et nager ! Il y a aussi des kayaks qui permettent de se déplacer facilement sur le lac.  L'accueil a été bon, le couple qui habite là, est presque tout le temps disponible.  Il y a 3 chambres, une qui parait plus grande que les 2 autres. Nous étions dans une des petites qui a été faite visiblement récemment. Elle est décorée simplement avec un lit double (attention si vous êtes 2 grands gabarits, le lit pourrait",40,929

Il manque un peu d'espace pour ranger ses affaires mais globalement, la chambre est bien.  Comme les chambres sont en haut de la propriété, on entend la nuit (quand il n'y a pas d'autre bruit) le bruit de l'autoroute mais ça n'est pas tellement gênant. A noter, qu'il y a pas mal d'escaliers à descendre pour aller au lac où, en plus du plongeoir, des hamacs et balançoires, il y a des chaises longues pour être tranquilles au bord de l'eau. Il y a aussi une grande terrasse qui donne sur le lac où on peut manger, boire un verre car il y a 2 grandes tables.  L'accès à Internet fonctionne dans les parties communes (pas dans les chambres) c'est à dire dans la zone au bord du lac, à l'extérieur des chambres et sur la terrasse avec les tables.  Nous avons pris et commandé le petit déjeuner sur place : c'était un peu long à l'avoir et il n'y avait pas un choix immense mais globalement c'était correct.

The water was clear, we could see the colours of the Laguna. Afterwards we had some food and drinks, we loved the camarones al coco, quite fair prices and the bar man was really kind and helpful. I would love to come back and it is definitely advised!!! ",50,933
"We stayed at one of the rustic cabins for two nights. The lodging option is ok, though a bit pricey for what you get. The cabañas needs some maintenance. The lagoon side areas and large gardens are very nice, quiet and feel very safe; you can go there to spend the day as well. You must have a way to move to and from this place, because it is a bit far from civilization, and there is virtually no Wi-Fi or cell signal in most of the area. Finding the place can be VERY HARD, this why I attached a photo of the nearest sign that you can seen both during the day, and especially in the pitch black night.

The collard aracari (toucan family) was a delight to see, as well as the chcalaca's, Great Kiskadee, social flycatcher, snail kite and the masked tityra.  We also saw a pumpkin wading along the shore, parrots flying overhead and brown jays.  The night sky was phenomenal at night when standing on the top roof. We only saw one motorboat a day on the lake.  The house well furnished, although the pots and pans seem to be a bit old, however, they are functional.  We had a bit of difficulty getting the TV to work but after an email to Sally she got it up and running (she was very responsive). ",40,936

I often found myself just staring out at the laguna with a smile on my face, thinking how amazing the view was, the colours, the sounds, I could never get enough of it!

There are several good restaurants in Bacalar (La Playita, savora, Kai Pez) many to choose from. Bacalar also has a market that is a little hard to find but it is a great place to get your fresh vegetables and fruit! The Rapidos de Bacalar is another great place to spend the day.

"My wife and I resided at this marvelous well designed and well constructed two-level cabana on the shore of beautiful Laguna Bacalar for 6 weeks, beginning in mid-February. While we were there, my cousin joined us for a week, and some married friends joined us for the final 2 weeks of our stay. Having two full bathrooms with showers, and spacious sleeping quarters up and down, everyone was accommodated very comfortably, and plenty of fans were provided for the very hot days. The fully-equipped kitchen was used extensively by our crew, and served us well. The large screened porch with tables and chairs made for a comfortable open-air eating, hammocking, and card playing area, while keeping the bugs and geckos outside. A washing machine on the back side of the cabana was handy for",50,937
"  laundering clothes on site. The grounds surrounding the cabana were loaded with lush tropical flowers, banana trees, and other vegetation, including cooking herbs. At the water's edge, there was a dock from which to swim or launch the two kayaks provided for exploring the coastline or easily reachable birding islands offshore. Also at the water's edge was a very nice, shady palapa, which became the perfect place to hang out on the hottest days, for it was cooled by the prevalent breezes coming off the Laguna. Many siestas were taken in the two hammocks there, and fun was had in feeding the fish tortillas tossed over the low-lying stone wall at the front of the palapa patio area. The latter was equipped with wi-fi capabilities, as was the cabana itself. The property was very secure, protected by a solid front gate and side fences. Two otherwise very friendly dogs help guard the place by barking at strangers and other dogs. The cabana doors locked securely, and there was a small safe for valuables. The cabana is well-located, within walking distance of  Cenote Azul in one direction, and the town of Bacalar in the other. There are also two nearby hotels for some off site dining when one is in the mood for that. The greatest thing of all about this property is Scott and Peggy, who have created and maintain it. They live in a separate house on site, and are two of the most conscientious, gracious, and hospitable hosts that we have ever had the joy of experiencing. Whenever we had a need, they met it! And their random acts of kindness warmed our hearts on many an occasion. It should be noted that both were a wealth of information about things to do and good places to eat in the area. Their personal connections are invaluable, and every one of their recommendations was spot on! Scott has literally put Bacalar on the map, having produced a widely disseminated local map for orientation purposes. We found in our explorations of Bacalar that when we stated that we were staying with Scott and Peggy, countenances would brighten and doors would open to further pleasant experiences. It doesn't get any better than that! ",50,937

We asked to visit their high tower with an incredible view on the lagoon which was possible without paying anything. We do appreciate the kindness of the staff of this hotel and we recommend this visit if possible with having a drink.,40,938
"This place is so lovely...it sits right on a magical lagoon, there's a tower perfect for sunset viewing, and one cannot deny the sweet community vibe permeating this space. We didn't plan to go to Bacalar at all on out trip, but it ended up being my favorite stop on a month-long journey.",50,938
We had a great time here - very friendly and fun owners. A really good way to spend new year. Amazing view of the lagoon - turquoise waters. Free access to kayaks all day too. Just a nice homely vibe at casa china,50,938
"Despite being listed on sites such as expedia, with prices and photos to suggest this is a hotel, it is not. Level of service, amenities, cleanliness, comfort, etc. is very much that of a hostel and not a hotel. Therefore it is quite overpriced. ",20,938
"A great hostel that also offers private rooms. The location it perfect- on the lagoon (!!!!!!!) Nice, comfortable rooms. Sweetest staff, so lovely and helpful. Best highlight- Sunrise kayaks with the sweetest Enrique and sunset Katamaran sail with yummyyyy ceviche, amazing cocktails and a live show of a local band - best experience we've had in Mexico! Don't miss it!! ",50,938
"We decided to get a place at the lake, so we took this Hostel.  You cant go in the water because of the seagrass. The room was dirty and full with different animals. The staff didnt care and was really unfriendly. ",10,938
"We traveled from Tulum for a quick getaway and stumbled upon Casa China by its awesome architecture, which my travel partner remembered vividly from a previous trip.  We were welcomed by Ricardo and his highly capable staff.  We selected the Pagoda room and were more than pleased - even better, they accepted our sweet puppy as well!!  In the morning we kayaked, Ricardo provided excellent recommendations, both for boat tours (their sailing trip was already full for the day, sadly!), as well as pizza!  The morning breakfast was fantastic, with perfect, fresh mango, apple, yogurt, bread and jam.  Couldn't have been happier and will return soon.  Thanks Ricardo and team!!  Tom & Family",50,938
"Casa China is ideally situated around the laguna, right by the Cenote Esmeralda. The crew was very welcoming. There is free access to the kayaks which are included in the rate of the room which is great too. The beds were huge and comfy. On the other hand, the breakfast was a bit disappointing: no roasted coffee (only instant one), a few slices of crispbread with margarine and jam, a few fruits. Secondly, the cleanliness level of the rooms (we had one with garden view for one night and one with lake view on the other) was not best-in-class, nore was the equipment ( no shower curtain, no soap holder and no soap or shampoo provided). Casa China is undergoing refurbishment at the moment to provide their guests with additional refurbished rooms, which might explain why the room was",40,938
" not so clean and not so fully equipped. Even so, the overall experience in Casa China was good, thanks to the friendly crew and the place. Bacalar is an absolute must see. Good place if you are after friendly, laid back places and not so much after high quality hotel service.",10,938

"We stayed three nights at the ranch in a cute cabana. We loved our stay! It was inexpensive, very relaxing and comfortable. The staff is great, very kind and welcoming. There's private access to the lake and the lake is truly paradise. The ranch was a great private spot but Bacalar town is close too. We loved the ranch and hope to return someday!",50,939
"First and foremost, ""thank you"". Each and every person at this one of a kind retreat we can not say enough about. During a month long stay beginning in Cozumel, to the interior of the Zona Maya in Chunhuhub, throughout Quintana Roo from Cancun to Chetumal, and to the beautiful state of Chiapas we found ourselves returning to Num Kaan Ranch. Three stays in all, first two in the perfect little ""Cabana Bella"" just right for two for the amazing price of $450 pesos (appx. $30.00 US). Our last stay in ""Casita Cowboy"", a beautiful home with all the amenities, fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, etc. Just us two on this trip but the house is set up for four - six. For two persons, a mere $1200 pesos! (appx. $80.00 US)  The detail Jeffrey and Brenda have put in to the ranch is",50,939
" impeccable. Hand made ranch style furniture from trees on the property. Victor, one of the most knowledgeable guys around when it comes to just about everything from harvesting a dead tree safely and turning it into some of the most beautiful, functional furniture was an absolute pleasure to be around and so willing to share his knowledge. Oh, and I can't help but mention one of the most beautiful welcoming smiles on the planet!!! He also made us omelets in the morning that were scrumptious.  We were very fortunate to visit with Jeffrey on several occasions, what a life saver. I developed a tooth ache while there and he not only recommended a great dentist but called him for us and made me an appointment for the very next day. Drew us a map and was there to make sure we found it and all was OK. Thanks again!! And Brenda, what can I say, I could have spent the day talking with you. A great sense of humor and endearing personality, had time permitted I would have loved to spend some time in the kitchen chopping and chatting, maybe next time! Everything about the ranch goes beyond the boundaries, the private dock and swimming area are pristine. It only takes one look at the crystal waters of Laguna Bacalar to know why it is called the lake of seven blues. With a limestone bottom you would think you were looking at the Caribbean but with a huge difference. Sweet clear water with beautiful little fish all around. Nothing to worry about if your like me and think once in the water I am only bait! No current, absolutely amazing warm fresh water. We couldn't get enough of it. Kayaking was fantastic and we paddled around for hours just soaking up the sun and the natural beauty of the laguna. Waking in the morning to see Angel bringing in the horses was truly a sight to behold. The animals are all so beautiful and completely cared for in every way. My favorite photo of Angel walking the stallion past the pool at sunrise is just one of many beautiful sites you will take in while staying at this great place. Of course I have included it in the photos below.  We were lucky to meet a few interesting people in the ""Jungle Horse Cantina"". One particular fellow who went by the nickname of ""Panchito"" He was from the nearby  Mennonite community of Salamanca and had drilled at least some of the wells at the ranch, A very good friend of Jeffreys . We struck up a conversation and to our surprise were invited to join him for a real life tour of this astounding community in the traditional manner, horse and buggy! It was fabulous and we're still dreaming of the home made cheese his sister made. If you care to visit, we were told everyone is welcome. A true ""trip in to the past"". Punch in Salamanca for our review with photos and hopefully if you visit Num Kaan Ranch you will also have the opportunity to see a real working Mennonite community.  We learned that Num Kaan meant infinite sky or endless sky and after spending time with the wonderful owners and staff we think it may also have another. ""Endless Memories""   Hasta la próxima vez!",50,939

"Als wir in Bacalar ankamen, hatten wir vorher einige Hotels im Internet rausgesucht und angefangen durchzutelefonieren (machten wir in der Regel lieber, um dem Hotel die Kommissions-Kosten zu ersparen und oft bekommt man auch ein günstigeres Angebot). Das Cabanas MR war wegen der Lage etwas außerhalb erst nicht unser Favorit. Nachdem aber andere Hotels deutlich teurer waren und wir hier ein gutes Angebot bekamen, wollten wir es uns doch anschauen. Wir hatten wirklich einen Glücksgriff gemacht! Super netter Empfang des Besitzers und seiner Mitarbeiterin. Uns wurde gleich ertklärt, dass wir uns jederzeit Kaffee oder Tee machen könnten, in einer Box standen auch einige Gebäckteile von denen wir hätten nehmen dürfen. Insgesamt gibt es 4 Bungalows auf dem Gelände, wir hatten den",40,940
" gleich links vorne. Der Bungalow war super geräumig und sauber. Etwas dunkel und das Bad ist nur durch einen Duschvorhang vom Zimmer getrennt bzw. nach oben ins Zimmer offen, aber das ist eben in solchen Bungalows so. W-Lan funktionierte gut, Warmwasser durch den Boiler ebenfalls. Die Lage war nicht so schlimm wie erwartet. Man ist in gemütlichen 10 Minuten zu einer Cenote gelaufen, bzw. 15-20 Minuten bis zum Ortskern. Hier gibt es nicht viel, der Ort ist eher trist und es ist auch sehr schwer an Bargeld zu kommen (bei uns hat es beim 4. ATM geklappt). Aber die Lagune nett und man kann hier gut 2 Tage verbringen. Einziges Manko an der Unterkunft war spätabends und sehr früh morgens eine Gruppe (der Besitzer und Freunde?) laut sprechender Männer direkt neben dem Bungalow in der offenen Küche. Die große und befahrene Straße störte allerdings nicht übermäßig. Ich würde wieder das Cabanas MR buchen, da das Preis- Leistungsverhältnis stimmt.",50,940

À côté de l’hôtel il y’a un autre hôtel qui balance du reagaeton toute la soirée . Et l’hôtel lui même balance du son bien fort également .

Nous avons pu garer notre voiture aussi à l’intérieur! bref, si l’on revient on hésitera pas à y retourner.",50,941
"El lugar es bonito, pero tiene los siguientes detalles, que de solucionarse sería una mejor estadía: 1.-el wi-fi no funcionó en toda la semana que estuvimos. 2.- No proporcionan más que 1 sola toalla de playa y no puedes sacar la del cuarto, porque te la cobran como si fuera de buena marca y nueva. ( Hay que llevar mejor sus propias toallas). 3.- La atención al cliente de la encargada NO es la más adecuada, todo el tiempo te está vigilando cómo si le fueran a robar algo. De ahí en fuera, si se quiere soportar esos temas en la estadía, pues bueno, pero la verdad...  NO LO RECOMIENDO!!",20,941

La chambre est conforme aux photos, très jolie et surtout magnifique vue sur le lagoon. Mention spéciale à angel et aurora pour leur gentillesse et serviabilité.

"DO NOT STAY HERE!  Last weekend somebody broke into our large dormitory room while 3 of us slept. 3 phones were taken from under our pillows and money from each of us. There was a party going on until 6am (literally next door) which obviously concealed the sounds of the intruder. Bags were searched through right next to our beds and certain items taken/left which showed   that the thief was very experienced. The bedroom was attached to another empty room (not locked) therefore it is likely an intruder hid in there until we went to sleep at 1AM. The discovery was made at 2.30 by another female traveler who then went on to wake us up, so the speed between us falling asleep and the robbery was very quick, well timed and executed.   There was high CCTV ripped from the wall, a sound",10,943
" I'm sure we would have heard if an intruder had entered after we fell asleep. The door wasn't locked and therefore open for all guests, despite being at the back of the building and requiring guests to enter through the front door first. I was concerned about this as I have always had a key to my dorm and was concerned about security, however I was repeatedly told it was fine and v safe. Clearly whoever was on night duty was not guarding the door efficiently, or as I suspect it was connected to an inside job.  Manuel was one of the workers here. He initially didn't want to call the police and we had to convince him over an hour period to do so. He then refused us access to the CCTV saying only the owner had access and he would come early in the morning to support us and investigate and pass on the footage to the police. The owner never turned up (even 3 days later) and neither the police or victims were  allowed to see the footage.    Manuel was dismissive, nobody apologied or asked if we were ok. We were not offered any room reimbursement (despite being awake all night and having the police at the property until 5am and then a party carrying on until 6am). I asked if this would be considered and was bluntly told no. A Spanish speaking friend came to the property to help us with the language barrier and support us while we were shaken, Manuel asked her to leave and told her she couldn't stay as she didn't sleep here. With only one person translating, it was clear he wanted to take away any language control we had of the situation.  Another victim stayed at the property to try and access the security footage and complete an official police report for insurance purposes. He informed me that while trying to ask Manuel if the owner would actually come or share informative footage, Manuel preceded to download pornography to his mobile, overtly watching it while ignoring the chap who had just been robbed.   I stayed in Bacalar for 2 months in a tent 4 years ago. I know the area well and always felt safe. I never had anything taken from the tent, however two nights at Hacienda Bambu and we were all robbed and then dismissed.   The lack of sympathy, helpfulness and honesty from their staff and the dismissivness of the apparent owner (who never appeared or offered CCTV) requires me to write this rev iew.  DO NOT STAY HERE!",40,943

"I recently stayed at this place in March of 2021.  The advertisement shows beautiful rooms with a view right next to the lagoon.  Indead that much is true, however, their rooms, or at least the room I was given was anything but!  I paid - in advance mind you, for a room with a VIEW and a BALCONY.  I got neither.  Instead, i was given an extremely small single bedroom  that looked like it was once used for storage and turned into a hotel room to make more profit.  Not only did my room not have a balcony and/or a view - it had ZERO windows!  The room had a nasty smell inside the room, as well.  The bathroom towels were old and felt like sandpaper.  The bed sheet and covering had a nasty brown stain on one corner - gross!  There was no TV, no fridge, no coffee maker, and the",10,944

Ridiculous!!  The only plus?  No roaches.  Don't get me wrong, Bacalar is a beautiful place and I highly recommend that you go and visit.  It's a wonder to see and experience.  But please, please, please, find a different place to stay.  I've lived in Mexico for over 10yrs and have been to many cities and states within.  So trust me, I know what economical means.

"The only thing royal about this place is the Royal Palms (or Roystonea Regia trees). It isn't even a hotel. There are four small buildings with a total of eight cabins on an uncleared piece of jungle that in part looks rather shabby, with construction rubble and junk in several places. Five cabins are situated not far from the main road and are therefore exposed to traffic noise. To get from these cabins to the lake one needs to follow a meandering unpaved road that gets muddy after a rain shower. The ""Beach Club"" is no more than a small piece of grass lawn beside the owner's residence at the water, which is also available as a hotel room. There is no bar or restaurant at this ""beach club"", but across from it is a reasonable restaurant. Royal Palm Bacalar pretends to be much",30,946
" more than it really is. The cabins are spacious and clean but basic. Water pressure was low. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We paid 1,650 MXN per night  for a cabin near the main road. There are no breakfast facilities, but if so wished breakfast can be ordered from a place nearby. The lagoon is spectacular. We weren't charged for the use of the kayaks and paddle boards.

"First off this is not a nice hotel.  Several of the rooms, including the one we were placed in open directly onto the sidewalk. On a very busy street. Right next to a restaurant that stays open till near midnight. So with the old original windows it’s a pretty noisy room.   The room next to it that we declined had a strong odor of poop.  The noise and location make it a poor choice for staying in Bakalar. The tiny tv and the cold lights make it a terrible choice. Especially for the cost.   The dishonesty comes into play when the front desk girl Monica asked if we wanted to take a tour of Lake Bakalar. we were on a tight schedule and figured that they would be competitively priced. Boy were we wrong! Monica told us that it would be a three hour tour and that would cost 400 pesos",10,949
" per person. And it was through a company further down the lake. Well we took the tour, which was fine, except for that it only lasted just under two hours. After we got off the boat I asked the tour manager why it didn’t last three hours to which he replied that none of his tours last three hours. I then  inquired as to how much the tour would cost directly from them - 250 pesos.  So Monica with Toto Blue sold me a three hour tour for a 60% mark up and we got a two hour tour. That’s highly dishonest and unethical.  When I communicated this to the management, which that day was the cook, he said there was nothing he could do about it. ( I had asked for a partial refund.) I explained to him that there WAS something he could do about it because I paid them cash and it was just sitting right there in the drawer. He could easily give me back the partial refund.  He proceeded to call Monica to ask how to handle the situation. He then came back and said that they pay that money directly to the tour company and that they don’t earn “a single cent” on the 400 pesos that I paid, to which I replied that indeed not because the tour company told me their real price and they also mentioned that the hotel would need to have their own mark up as well. Which I get, just not 60%. Not to mention there’s not a company in this world that sells a product without making money on it. Giving things for away for free is not a business! After explaining all this to him and how dishonest they had been in selling me a three hour tour he insisted there was nothing that they could do.  And why would they, they have my cash and they figure I am a one-time visitor.  Grab the gringos cash any way you can and run.  I’d steer clear of this place if I were you.",20,949

"I’m writing this review as I’m checking out of the hotel. We booked this accomodation thinking it was luxury tier as advertised on their website, our mistake was not reading the reviews on trip advisor prior to booking the room.  Upon arrival we noticed our room (a family room) was located on street side and right next to a taco shop, making it the noisiest place I’ve stayed at in my entire life. The shower/ restroom area looked old and dirty, only two towels were provided for a room of four people (both of them felt rough, old and one of them was even permanently stained in purple colour); another point that’s important to mention is that water in the building starts running at 7 p.m and once my dad asked the manager the reason why, the response given was “it’s not my problem,",40,949
" it’s town hall’s” which in my opinion was rude considering my dad IS the customer of the hotel (side note: water in the shower was cold and started running 1 hour late).   When it comes to ammenities bottled water was not provided, there’s NO parking & the wifi connection couldn’t be reached in my room.   Overall I wouldn’t give this place more than 2 stars, it should be ranked at hostel category or as a two star hotel because this is definitely not “boutique hotel level”. You definitely DO NOT get value for the money (we paid almost 200 USD for the one night we booked here, not even Hyatt Regency Guadalajara charges as much and that one IS luxury tier).   I’d recommend you to book a room somewhere else (Chetumal has better options, even business hotels are nicer) to save yourself from major disappointment & regret. ",50,949

"Great staff, clean and spacious rooms, and parking available. Generally quite happy.  Would definitely recommend when staying in Bacalar.  Minor points: the pool, although lovely for the eye, is not for actual swimming (quite small). Breakfast was good, but could have more options. ",40,951
"Perfect hotel for our stay in Bacalar. Great customer service, amazing rooftop with a pool and lagoon view, super yummy breakfast, free parking and good internet.  Totally recommend it.  Will definitely be back.",50,952
We enjoyed a lot the Tuparenda hotel in Bacalar for its friendly staff and easy communication. Hotel location a 10min walk to main square and there are some good restaurants/bars within 5min walk. Staff can recommend you good ones (as well as tours). Nice pool and terrace on the rooftop (enlighted with nice colors when it gets dark) and you can view the lagoon from the top. Room was clean and has everything you need! Free parking and good internet. Totally recommend it!,50,952
"My parents and I just had a wonderful stay at Hotel Tuparenda in Bacalar. We were greeted by the owner Francisco who could not have been more helpful giving us food recommendations and organizing a wonderful boat tour for us the next morning. He was very attentive to our needs and continued to check in with us during our stay to ensure we were having a wonderful time. The property is very new and the room was immaculate. The shower had great pressure and was the warmest shower we’ve had in Mexico. The hotel is in a great location close to the lagoon and many wonderful restaurants. The breakfast that was included was just wonderful. There were fruits, yogurt, granola, pastries and toast as well as a hot plate each day which was most delicious. I would not hesitate to recommend",50,952
 this hotel to anyone visiting Bacalar and my family and i will definitely be back! Thank you Francisco and your wonderful family for an unforgettable visit! ,40,952
…,50,952
"The hotel is at the limit north offre the town. So neighbourhood are not so nice but safe (some wild dogs around) . But you have very closed a public beach. Rooms are dark (only windows is on passage alley) but clean. Good air conditioning system, good and spacious bathroom. Breakfast is ok: they have fresh fruits, flakes yogurth and they can prepare eggs any style and pancakes. Trust owner suggestions for beaches. We were very satisfied. ",50,952
"This amazing family own hotel would fill all your expectations, super clean , great details and decoration ,spacious rooms . Excellent location, delicious breakfast in the amazing roof top with great view to the lake,, but the most important, outstanding service by owner Francisco and his family, they’re there for you 24/7,,,this place worth every single penny,,, 100% recommended!!!!!!!!",50,952
"few steps from the lagoon with public access. courtesy  and kindness of the owner.the place ""vale la pena"" because is ""pura vida"". Not yet ""Cancunized""  and still remains the same quiet and relaxing site",40,952
"My title says it all really. My Spanish is poor, the staff team spent time ensuring we understood one another - particularly useful at breakfast. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable. Could not ask for more for the price. Spot on. ",50,952
Check in was fast and easy and recommendations on things to do and places to eat were perfect.   The room was neat and clean.  Perhaps the only thing missing was a chair in the room but the common lounge area was comfortable and served the purpose.  The free breakfast was a great way to start the day. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Do take the boat tour they recommend!,50,952
"I had the most wonderful time there. It’s like living in a private house just in front of the lagoon, with a direct access into the water (and free kayaks). The room was clean and had amazing view. The stuff was so nice. It felt like home. Definitely recommend.",50,953
"My wife and I visited Bacalar in October 2021 and we had an excellent stay at Amigos Hotelito. The staff is incredibly kind and helpful. They helped us book a boat tour, get taxis and provided great recommendations for places to eat and visit in Bacalar. Our room was fantastic and included a balcony and hammock. The hotel also has a dock and hammock, which I loved. This is a great spot if you want a more intimate experience versus a huge, soulless hotel.",50,953
"We arrived to a clean and organized place with friendly staff. Room was nice and comfortable, but I would recommend putting cotton sheets, arranging the water supply in bathroom and shower, some leaks and water pressure not very good. It would be amazing having dish ware available 24/7.",30,953
"We stayed only two nights in this delightful small hotel with a great view of the beautiful lake - two nights isn't nearly enough.  It was a pleasant, clean and reasonably spacious room. The owner Sebastian was friendly and enormously helpful advising on restaurants, arranged sailing tour  and he drove one of us to see a doctor and Sebastian translated for us as the doctor couldn't speak English.  One of his staff whose name I can't remember was also very friendly and helpful.",50,953
"My husband, my daughter and myself stayed at Amigos Hotelito for 2 nights. I would recommend the hotel for its location (waterfront), price (good value) and friendly staff, although the rooms are basic and there is no restaurant. You have to drive or walk to town for food. The best part was relaxing on the deck with amazing views of the lagoon. The hotel arranged for us a sailboat tour (no polluting motorboats) that was a lot of fun. We saw the sun set as the full moon was rising. The hotel also rents kayaks. All in all it was a good stay.",40,953
"I will recommend this place for its price and its location. It is very relaxing and peaceful, only 6 guest rooms. It is located walking distance (15 minutes) from the center. But the best it is the view of the lake from the hotel. Paradise! If you are looking for to disconnect from the world, this is the place. They offer free WIFI, and a fridge and microwave is a available to use in the common area. There is NO restaurant. ",40,953
"We stayed here for a few nights over Christmas. The rooms are great, clean and with wonderful views. However, on the upstairs rooms, you have to slam the door to shut it. It can get very loud and disturbing.   This is not a bed and breakfast. They don't even have coffee in the morning. We bought our own ground coffee in town and used their coffee pot. Unfortunately, other guests thought it was the hotels coffee and helped themselves to it.   Im not sure if it was because of the holidays, but it appeared that no one worked at the hotel. We could not find staff to ask about bikes or kayaks. So we settled on the dock and relaxed. That was fine too.",50,953
"The hotelito is excellent, hosts are very nice.rooms are super, with own balcony and nice beachview! The common kitchen was great for using. Kayaks are available and we made more tours with sunrise on the lake. For friends, travellers or couples also a great choice! ",50,953
"We traveled to Bacalar with friends from Cancun.  Its always great when traveling with people who know the area when you are traveling in a foreign country.  Our friends wanted us to see on of their favorite places so they took us to Lake Bacalar.   We stayed at Amigos for 2 nights.  The place was really neat.  It wasn't fancy and I don't think it can be called a Bed & Breakfast.  It was neat and clean with a porch with a hammock.  I think it only had 6 rooms and the caretaker, Sebastian stayed in one of them with his dog, I think her name was Luna.  There was a lobby of some sorts with a refrigerator that you could use. The first night we ordered supper at a nearby restaurant that was recommended by Sebastian.  Lots of food and very good.    We brought a boat down and spent a",40,953
" lot of time on the lake.  It was beautiful with colors that you would associate to the Caribbean.  Loved swimming in the fresh water.    We paid about $57 a night.  We had a king size bed and a twin that had a pull out.  We had satellite TV and Internet.    We had a room on the first floor.  One step down off the porch and you were on the big patio just off the lobby.    You do have to go down lots of step to get to the hotel from the road,.,  Definitely not handicapped accessible. They do have a gate where they can lock up the parking lot..",50,953
Such a peacful place on the perfect lake of Bacalar with its blue waters and white sands.  Kayaks and paddle boards are complementary  which is a plus. The very well kept  garden with lots of possibilities makes you feel at home . The staff is friendly and helpful. The bungalows are furnished nicely with special care and the AC works perfect.  My Tacos were prepared fresh and tasted very good. We will come again to this little heaven.,50,954
"The hotel itself and the room is quite nice. However, we had a minor and a major issue.  Minor: The food is not good. This is really a pity since it would be amazing to hang out at the lake all day. Like this, you have to get into town for lunch and dinner which is quite a hassle. Also, they only offer 2 pieces of toast per person in the morning which is an incredibly stupid artificial limit and left me hungry.  Major: I gave them my laundry to wash. Apparently, they gave it to an external laundry. It had a gut-wrenching smell when it came back. The staff agreed that it was pretty horrible, but refused to help us beyond giving us the number of the laundry service. When we called the external laundry service, they refused to do anything about it. We ended up paying (100 pesos)",10,954
" for a load of laundry that immediately needs another wash somewhere else. We escalalated it at the hotel, but they kept referring us to the external laundry service. (""You can get a taxi and go talk to them"") This is unacceptable for a service we bought at the hotel.  Overall, due to the fact that the staff and the management doesn't care about the experience of the guests, I recommend not to stay here.",50,954
…,50,954
"The place is very clean and quiet, cabins are decorated differently and they are very nice. We stayed at the Cisne and we really love the landscape of the place in general. At night time the place looks gorgeous.  Do not expect to have a great meal there. That is the one thing they have to work on however, since the hotel is located in town you will have plenty of choices to go eat for either meal.   We will definitely go back.",20,954
"Since we arrived we were in love with the view , blue bird has the best facilities, private bungalows, bar, kayaks, paddle board...is very well located, you just swim few meters and get to a small island infront that is a magical paradise. Service is excelent! We definitely recommend to stay at blue bird, all the facilities included on the rate is great so you don't pay extras like other places! Private , cozy and extremely comfortable!  We will be back soon!!!",50,954
"the Service is bad....  The linen and towels are dirty and Stains.  Bad and small breakfast, They lied about what we should get.  The hotel and facilities are beautiful, But there is no service consciousness  ",50,954
"Perfect rooms, beautiful lagoon, Kiaking and watersports ? They have it. 7 shades of blue and hammocks plus swings inside the water . Would definitely come back again a million times. Aswell,  don’t get me started on Djamillas food ! ",10,954
"A beautiful hotel and a real oasis after a long drive. Rooms are beautifully designed (incl AC and a fan) and hot showers. There are two lovely pools, yoga classes Fri - Sun (included), breakfast, an honesty bar area, a great library with books to read and board games to play. Everything you need for a very chilled out experience. Staff are friendly and helpful too. Would recommend!",50,955
"My husband and I stayed at Casa Hormiga over the Easter weekend and couldn’t be happier with our choice. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and has amazing staff.  Breakfast is included with your stay and it’s super yummy. The staff is super attentive and always ready to help. We will definitely be coming back to stay here on our next trip to Bacalar.   P.S. They are affiliated with La Playita which is a restaurant right on the Lagoon. This alone is a great perk when trying to get a table to eat at La Playita because believe me, you’ll want to go there.",50,955
"We loved this hotel so much! From the minute you arrive it is so tranquil - hard to do it justice but the architecture and design is breathtaking. It’s so quiet and peaceful. Great location to the town of Bacalar and lots of nice restaurants nearby. La Playita is their beach club so you get to skip the queue and get a table there which they will organise for you. The breakfast was lovely - a buffet selection and you can also order off the menu. We ate lunch snacks and dinner here once or twice too and all the food was so delicious, especially the guacamole. Loved the honesty bar - you do really feel at home there. It would be nice if there were proper sun loungers but understand the pool area is smaller - just a tiny thing! Staff were all so lovely and helpful - defo recommend",50,955
 borrowing their bikes and cycling around the streets of Bacalar! We loved it so much we came back for another night - thanks so much Casa Hormiga for an amazing stay.,50,955
…,50,955
"The aesthetics was everything that we hoped for.  It was so beautiful.  The decor was amazing.  They had an “honest bar” where we could get drinks if the bartender wasn’t present and write it down on our tab.  They had yoga in the mornings and a nice pool.  They had bikes that we could borrow which we took around town and was great fun.  The staff was very helpful and kind.  The only negative comment I have it that we are light sleepers.  We brought a white noise machine and ear plugs but wasn’t enough for us as the dogs outside of the casa were barking most of the night, which I hear is common in Mexico.  Overall we had a pleasant stay.",50,955
"Beautiful review, lovely fresh breakfasts (yes there are eggs, and yogurt and homemade granola… and ingredients for Mexican breakfast and fresh fruit, juices, homemade bread, and jams.  Pools and grounds gorgeous, library of art books amazing.  Kind helpful staff.  Massages great, and their beach club la playita, so yummy and great spot too.  Rooms wonderful and my tweens and teen loved it too-games to play in library.  Cool pool.  Loft bed!",50,955
"The staff, property, everything is excellent! I’ve spent the nicest 5 days in Bacalar  Quiet and peaceful place. You can ask to order the dinner to your room from the restaurant, breakfast is included. The pool is not big but very well designed, feels like your private space. There are a special place for yoga or meditation and a library. Highly recommend!",50,955
Absolutely loved our stay at Casa Hormiga. One of the highlights of a two week trip to the Yucatan. We added a second night. By staying in town itself your forego staying on the beautiful lagoon but the hotel arranged a private sailing for us (180$) which was amazing and we loved being able to walk around town to eat and drink. They have access to a beach club which we didn't use as well as bikes to get around. The design of the hotel is stunning and the staff was wonderful. It's a specific kind of luxury (no tv no music etc..) but I loved it.,40,955
"Very friendly and helpful staff, perfectly designed and decorated. An oasis of calm and comfort. Has no direct access to lagune, but great location close to restaurants and public access to lagune close by. We enjoyed our stay so much that we extended our time at Casa Hormiga. It was simply perfect!",50,955
La Albarina was a very cute space. It was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. They do not have very many people working and they close the food/bar at 4pm. They are otherwise extremely helpful and there whenever you need help to call a taxi/carry luggage/etc. La Albarina definitely has one of the best locations on the whole lake and a very nice space to relax and swim. Boats can pick you up at the dock and it is a very cheap and speedy taxi ride to town. Overall such a breathtaking place- I absolutely loved Bacalar and will be returning!,40,956
"Cet chambre d’hôte a le potentiel pour avoir une meilleure note car l’hôte est très gentil, très serviable , le cadre est magnifique et le petit déjeuner est très bon.  Très bien situé , chambre très propre et spacieuse , bien équipé.  Le gros problème c’est que vous ne pouvez pas dormir , il y a plusieurs coq qui commencent à brailler des 4h du matin toute les 20 minutes jusqu’à 7h et les chambres sont insonoriser du coup vous entendez toute la conversation de la chambre à côté.  C’est vraiment dommage car à part cela tout est bien mais je suis repartis fatigué après deux nuits la bas..",30,956
"Wunderschöne und sehr gepflegte Anlage, direkt am See, zwischen zwei Zenoten. Es ist angenehm ruhig und lädt zum Verweilen ein. Die Besitzerin und der Manager, sowie alle Angestellten sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer haben alles, was man sich wünscht. Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. WiFi funktioniert bestens. Wer relaxen möchte, ist hier richtig.  Es gibt keine Restaurants zum Abendessen in dieser Gegend. In ca. 45 Minuten ist man zu Fuss im Zentrum. Mit dem Auto dauert es wenige Minuten. Oder man nimmt ein Taxi für ca. 4 EUR.",50,956
"Nicht wundern! ..sobald die Tore vom Personal aufgemacht werden, eröffnet sich der direkte Blick auf die Lagune und lässt das Reiseherz höher schlagen!   Ein Ort zum entspannen! Auf unserer Durchreise haben wir eine Nacht reserviert, wir hätten uns aber auch einen längeren Aufenthalt vorstellen können.   Die kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellten SUPs laden direkt ein die Lagune zu erkunden oder an die nahe gelegenden Cenoten zu paddeln.   Der Aufenthalt war sorgenfrei und auch unser Mietauto stand sicher im Innenhof.  Gerne wieder ",40,956
"A true retreat on the lake just a bit out of town next to the Cenote Azul and virtually on the cenote in the lake. Great snorkeling right from the dock with lots of places to just chill and take in the view. The room was perfectly done, as were the grounds. The couple who own and run this place are a delight. They explained the Stromatolites, their importance and how to respect them. They also arranged a private boat tour of the lake. We only wished we could have stayed another day or two!",50,956
"Never experienced such a bad attitude from the managers. Paco, one of the managers has no hospitality training, no touch, no idea of what customer service is behaves like a dysfuctional robot. Seems to be that he does not even want to be there. The place is not what it seems to be on the photos. The views on the rooms are not as shown. Despite of an intent to revamp and old property it just feels old. Not to mention that they do not care at all about protecting the Stromatolites that they are right on the property. The staff does not even respect the privacy of the guest. Terrible place for couples.",10,956
"This place is a joke ! At first I was ok i will see how it is ! Customer service is poor ! Prices is over vs the quality of place ! No curtain on the shower and no possibilities to turn on the AC while the balcony door is open just a little as it will likeage ! Third night was a nightmare, party was ongoing until 4am into the private neighborhood then following by a noise of vaccuum terrasse cleaner at 7am ! I didnt sleep and left the place without having breakfast ! I have advised the owner and asked for my third night refund ! ( not accepted) and the owner were accusing me not having pay my extras from the room( which i didnt took anything ) ! DO NOT GO to this hotel ! ",10,956
"What a delightful experience! Top notch service, top notch room, top notch environment and experience. A very personalized stay and good vibes from Roberto who listened and responded to any/all needs and requests going above and beyond every single time. This quiet little place is right on Lake Bacalar with preserved natural surroundings, hammocks, and lush green surroundings. Paddle boards available to enjoy the sunrise or sunset on the water. Safe for all to travel, gated area, parking, wifi, and extra clean and spotless rooms. Very authentic and natural decor and felt very luxurious on the lake. Perfection.",50,956
"We had a wonderful stay at La Albarina. The hotel grounds are beautiful and very relaxing. The hotel's owner, Roberto was very friendly and helped us with whatever we needed. The location on the lagoon is amazing, and it's a short drive into town where there are restaurants and shops. I would recommend having some cash on hand because almost all of the ATMs in town were broken.",50,956
Roberto and staff we unreal as we happen to have the whole facility to ourselves...The continental breakfast each morning was perfect and coupled with the view it was over the top...We’ll be back...  Ron C,50,956
+ Location  - Dirty rooms  - poor WiFi  - no real toilet (just holes in the ground)  - very bad road to get there  - restaurant does not deserve the name - rather an fast food shack   All in all at the level of an average hostel - for more than 100 Euro per night not acceptable.  ,10,957
"We just returned from a FANTASTIC holiday at this unique and magic place.  The road is bumpy yes because you are not arriving to the St. Regis!!! Instead you hace the opportunity to enjoy and authentic Eco Hotel with fantastic service, authentic home made taste cuisine and above all outstanding hospitality.  The place is owned and managed by a Mexican family which are truly committed to deliver service excellence, the staff is so courteous and accommodating. Nothing is by the book they rather create a tailor made experience for you. Great facility and wonderful details.  I have been in many hoteles around the globe and I can honestly tell you that the sleeping quality was simply the best. There are very few places where you can wake up listening to the birds singing. The room is",50,957
" fantastic in all senses, you feel transported to a magic place where all you have to do is enjoy!!!  Thank you Kuuch Kaanil, you made our holidays perfect hence we will be back for sure. Every single minute was enjoyable with you guys!!!!! Even being a big party you were able to accommodate making things happen as if we were the only guest in the hotel despite there were others.

"I really like the place a lot, If you are looking for a retreat with privacy, silence, a place to read, to actually disconnect from all the stress outside, this is your place, quiet little cabin, a friend and I went there to have a space for ourselves.  Being in the middle of nowhere has its pros and cons, for me it was a new experience, the cabins are nice with the basic stuff, the shower and toilet where different from what we are used to but we manage,   The food is a very simple menu but lovely food, food from granma's house, Huevos revueltos, tacos de pollo, hamburguesas, sincronizadas, quesadillas, etc. very Mexican simple but good food.  The staff awesome, always have a smile, always there to help you if you need anything, very lovely nice people.  We spent the days",10,957
" reading, playing domino, eating, meditating, listening, talking...  The closest thing is 10kms away so bring enough things to do  The road to get there is good 95% of it just a little rough for the last 5%, again, is in the middle of nowhere, Eco friendly hotel,  do not expect a perfect road, but... well is just at the end of the journey to get there, is in the middle of the jungle!!  In the end, if you want a place for peace and quiet and very simple but delicious meal and the basic services, you will have fun, if not, look for other options.",30,957

"This hotel is priced as a luxury hotel (US$ 100+ per night), but it fails to deliver in all aspects. I stayed there for 2 of the 4 nights I had booked and moved to Rancho Encantado, which is infinitely better and at the same price. Mattress is lumpy and uncomfortable, pillows are horribly tortuous!  The room is dark and dingy and furniture is cheap and amateur- ecologic does not have to be dingy and old!! Outdoor bathroom sounds sexy and nice, but it's not when you're trying to use the toilet and have rain coming down on you... The restaurant is improvised and food is definitely not worth the price. Although it claims to be ecologic, it has a diesel water pump running ALL DAY, pumping water out of the Bacalar lagoon and a diesel generator running ALL NIGHT to power light bulbs",40,957
" and AC outlets. Nothing ecologic about that, also extremely unpleasant to always have that background noise!!  Staff is very friendly but did not reimburse us for the two nights we did not stay.",40,957
…,40,957
"I booked for two nights on the same day with no problem! This place is the absolute cutest. The look of the hotel is very nice and zen, I was extremely pleased. You're about a 5-minute walk from the lagoon which makes this spot even better. I really enjoyed their outside space that is provided in the back to just hang out.  Each front desk receptionist was super helpful and provided us as many water bottles as we needed! Our room was very clean and the hot water worked perfectly (I did have to ask for assistance for the hot water but it worked).   Top of the line place, I recommend for everyone to stay here if you're visiting Bacalar! You will have everything you need if you stay here.  ",50,958
"We stayed in this boutique hotel for 3 nights, and it was great! Rooms are very clean, staff is supper friendly and accommodating. The rooms have everything that you need. If you thinking of visiting Bacalar, stay at this hotel.  ",50,958
"We arrived very late with no reservation and must have snagged the last room. The man at the front was extremely helpful and got us checked in right away so we could get showered and to sleep. The bed was extra comfy, no hot water, but they said they were fixing it when we were there.The place was so zen and beautiful. The breakfast is delicious and every single person who worked there was friendly. Really enjoyed my stay here. Felt like paradise. ",50,958

"Me and my husband decided to have 3 relaxing days to this beautiful destination which is Bacalar and we stayed at Villa Balu Hotel Boutique, BEST choice ever. From the service and the Hotel itself  everything was Amazing. We wanted to do some water tour around the Lagoon and they provide us the tour!! is not Amazing??? what ever your needs are, they make it possible. The Staff is very friendly and that the continental breakfast is included is plus !!!! Thank you so much for such a great experience. We are going to came back for Sure!! Extremely recommended!!",50,958
"I went to Bacalar for q couple days and stay at this beautiful and just bran new hotel. Everything was perfect!!  The location is great ! Close to everything l, you can walk anywhere you want to go. The service is amazin everyone is trying so hard to do the best to help you and serve.  The rooms are very nice and clean. Just brand new  I love it l. Highly recommended",50,958
"The positives: lovely large pool and design.  Tasty breakfasts (but see below).  Great public spaces (which you will use).   Relatively spacious bathroom.   Price acceptable.  However realise that you will have not one extra inch to move in the room, and will have to climb steep stairs to the bed, which will require one of a couple to clamber over the other to get in or out of the small loft space.  If you are fine with that, or a solo traveller, then this could be a good option.  Also, filter coffee refills at breakfast in small coffee cups charged for each after the first, and if you want milk with your coffee, that will be an extra 10 pesos for that thimble of milk.  Seriously, a lot of good will lost in a matter of seconds.  Shame, as that pool and the loungers are",30,959

"Great hotel, especially the chill-areas. Haven't seen a hotel like this before. Rooms are a bit small though and so was the bed, but I have to say that I'm used to a huge bed, so maybe I'm spoiled. We had some issues with our rooms, which were mechanical. Things happen..it's about how you handle these things. they did their utmost best to make us satisfied, which we definitely were.  Great: - the service was excellent. Jessica and the other girl (sry for forgetting the name) we're precisely the hosts that someone in a hotel should be. The rest of the staff deserves a compliment as well. Can't stress enough how welcome we felt. - the pool!!! Oh my, how awesome. - chill out areas. The ladies absolutely loved the nets and the hovering beds. - hygiene is perfect  Could be better: -",50,959
" the rooms and bed were somewhat small. But it's not a very big deal. - breakfast is probably nice, but a lot of beans and no bread. It's just not our thing. Although if you ask for plain eggs, you'll get them.  Not great: - nothing  Conclusion: very satisfied. Go there if you go to bacalar. This hotel made our stay in bacalar much better than it otherwise would be probably.",10,959

"Stayed for 2 nights and would have loved to stay longer. Friendly staff, ecological pool and mindset. Great breakfast was included. Choice of two from the menu: One sweet and one savory. The rooms could seem small to some people and the stairs yo the bed a bit steep but it has all you need and the hanging out can easily be done at other spots of the hotel. Hammock in front of the room, swing over the pool, relaxing area next to the small pool at the top. The location also near to the center as well as to the lagoon. The first two free public entrances are across the street of the hotel. At the end of the road there is another free public entrance to the lagoon as well as the Balenario with a fee of 20 Pesos.  If we had to say something negative it would be the loud music playing",50,959

Our stay at the Eco Hotel Boutique Makaabá in Bacalar was extraordinary :) We were not only happy with the room and the people but with the whole concept of the hotel. We are really thankful for their work and commitment to our planet. The food was also really special and delicious. Without doubt we would come back here in our next stay in Bacalar!!  We are already missing the dog Nina!  Saludos  Annie & Thalía,40,959
"We really had a GREAT TIME!!   First time to Bacalar - probably won't go back. Been there done that - but it was a nice trip and the hotel was was clean, great breakfast, nice pool, no complaints - centrally located - they have a fridge in the main lobby if you want to store food or beverages.  Blackouts happen pretty regularly in the town and I mean whole town goes black - but not for long.  Our friends went the week after we did - blackout!!",50,960
"We really enjoyed our stay here.  Perhaps it wasn't as luxurious as some we stayed in but the rooms were clean, spacious and had air conditioning.  Sitting by the pool with a cold beverage was a daily activity.  It is close enough to city centre to make a nice walk.  You can catch a local softball game just a couple blocks away.  The lake front is also well within walking distance and we went every day as well.  There are good restaurants all within 15 minutes walk and you can rent bikes if you want.  They offer tours of the beautiful lagoon, which we would highly recommend.  It is a very fun tour and so interesting.  The staff is knowledgeable and very helpful.  We would stay here again, no hesitation.  We felt safe and well looked after!",40,960
"The place is quiet, nice and clean, the pool area is very nice, the staff is friendly and gentle. The breakfast has the traditional Mexican homemade style. I love the tortillas and the Mexican sausage  I want to go back there soon !!!",50,960
We stayed for two nights the place was super clean and had everything we needed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool and awesome breakfast were great bonuses. I would recommend and hope to visit again soon myself.,50,960
"Hotel Bacienda is a clean and tidy hotel within walking distance to Central Bacalar. The staff were lovely and the free breakfast was more than satisfactory. The bed was also one of the comfiest I stayed in during my time in Mexico, including a 4 star resort in Tulum!",50,960
Nice clean rooms and pool. Location ok. A 5 min walk to Centro and Balsinaro municipal. Comfortable beds. Breakfast ok so for the price: Perfect! Try the good street food just across the street. Tacueria Mucho. Great food cheap. Quesadila or Torta (sandwich) 30$.,50,960
"The good points are - the price - the location not far away from city center - it was clean  Now the bad things. The breakfast was horrible. They have only two different things to eat to choose from and both weren't good. Coffee is not drinkable. Our room did not have a real window, pretty dark inside. bathroom needs to be updated. WIFI does only work inside the reception building.  It was good enough to stay there for one night but i was happy to leave the next day as well.",30,960
"My family and I went for vacation and we did not have a reservation. We found this hotel on last minute and in reasonable price 700 MXP here are the things that went well  - good location around 10 minutes to the laguna and center where is the park - the rooms were clean, our room had TV and air conditionary - It has outside pool  the only thing I didn't like was the Breakfast. It was included but the service was very slow. there were a lot of people and only one coffe machine and did not work very well. the wifi only works in the front desk",30,960
Better than many other budget hotel beds/pillows. Shower/bath was same. Must remember to turn on the water heater in the am to get a hot shower. Was quiet and east walk to the centro. Excellent restaurant there on the opposite side (didn't write down the name). Not a beach town but quiet nice town. would go back to explore more. Breakfast included. Scrambled eggs/fruit. Very nice. Local attraction..Lagoon of 7 colors...do it!!! But use a recommended licensed tour. We didn't and although it was a great experience on a small catamaran the agreed upon price was bumped up considerably after. Course we could have refused but live and learn.,40,960
"A reasonable option. A business-like welcome rather than super friendly but OK nonetheless. Clean rooms, about 10 minutes or so walk to the main square. Breakfast was included but it was nothing to get excited about - scrambled eggs and a tiny portion of refried beans. One morning I was mildly amused to see the reception staff tucking into the same but slightly bigger portions, with the addition of a bowl of fruit salad. Hire bikes available but they deparately need some maintenace. Better to get a bike somewhere else if you can find one. ",40,960
"Hotel nuevo y bonito. La habitaciones son muy limpias y lindas bien equipadas. Con una hermosa vista al lago, camastros y mesas con vista al muelle y lago. Disfrutamos mucho este pequeño lugar, desde la llegada Morelia recepcionista fue muy agradable, los cócteles del bar estaban increíbles, muy ricos y bien presentados. El desayuno estuvo delicioso. Es 100 recomendable. Solo nos hubiera gustado que ahí mismo rentaran , paddles ,bicis y Kayaks. Pero justo a lado conseguimos ese equipo. De igual modo el restaurante cierra temprano y la carta necesita mejorar. Pero si vas a descansar este es el lugar perfecto para hacerlo. ",50,961
"Excelente opción para un buen desayuno, pan de masa madre hecho en casa y la.vista es muy bonita , el pan de plátano y sus conchas son muy ricas, Recomiendo ampliar su menú para almuerzos puesto que solo hay alimentos de 8 am a 2 ok y es el mismo menú, precio promedio de 150 pesos por platillo  ",40,961
"Très belle chambre, accès à la lagune via un ponton, seul point noir : 8 transats seulement. Serviettes de bain à disposition.  Chambre très propre et spacieuse. Bon restaurant. Petit déjeuner avec choix. Calme.  Il est préférable d avoir une voiture pour y accéder. Quelques restaurants à proximité . Personnel très serviable, au bar on maîtrise bien l anglais.",50,961
"Excelente atención, muy atentos a que necesitas abierto a opiniones. Instalaciones padrisimas, excelente comida en su restaurante!, Es un Hotel prácticamente nuevo. Acceso al la Laguna para nadar. Personal muy amable ellos te ayudan a coordinar Tours.",50,961
Prachtige locatie! Heel mooi aangelegd. Ruime schone kamers. Vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Lekkere cocktails.  Het inclusieve ontbijt is erg eenvoudig. Dat had wat uitgebreider gemogen. Verder echt een aanrader! Uitstekende prijs/kwaliteit verhouding,50,961
"Sehr nettes Hotel. Schöne Anlange mit Lagunenzugang, etwas außerhalb des Zentrums (Gehstrecke 25 Minuten oder Taxi 50 Pesos). Sehr saubere Zimmer!  Das Personal war immer überaus freundlich und zuvorkommend! Sehr leckere Cocktails. Frühstück ist recht einfach, aber man kann sich a la carte dazu bestellen.  Ich würde definitiv wieder kommen!",50,961
"We had en-suite room with 2 beds: one king one double. Clean place, good AC in the room, good en-suite, close to the cenotes, attentive staff. Wifi works. There is clean water and tea and coffee and biscuits in the hall also. Thanks for a great stay!",50,962
"The Hotel is well situated, very close to the Lagoon, and a few hundred meters from the zocalo, the central square. The price is very competitive and if you don't mind a short walk, or if you have a car, is a very good choice.  The hotel provides for free some coffee and cookies in the morning. Our room was quite small but well equipped with a/c, fan, tv and fridge.",30,962
We had a 2 night stay here and it was very comfortable. The room itself was small but very modern with great wifi and bathroom facilities. Free coffee right outside my room which was a win for my partner. The only down side was we were on the ground level and it was quite noisy at night. There was a lot of noise from kids (toddlers) around 11pm which was odd but lots of chatting aswell which disturbed our sleep a bit. If you’re not on the ground floor I’m sure it’s not an issue though. Good stay otherwise.,40,962
"Very clean hotel, everything is very close, like the Fuerte de San Felipe, the lagoon and the cenotes. Staff is very friendly and they also have tours available at a very affordable price. Parking available but very limited",50,962
Good enough location just a 10 min walk and you're in the water. Same for restaurants etc. Room was spacious and clean with ac and youtube and netflix with the cable tv. Not that we spent any time indoors anyway. Free coffee and water in the lobby and parking out front. Friendly and helpful staff.  ,40,962
"We had 2 nights at El Roble on our 4 month travelling trip around central and South America. The hotel itself is nice, we had a giant king size bed, aircon, a little fridge - all luxuries that are appreciated when your travelling on a relatively tight budget.  HOWEVER. Next doors yard backed straight onto our window. As soon as we got into the room, we noticed a lot of dog barking, but this was nothing compared to the screeching Rooster next to our window. EVERY. 20. SECONDS.  Within 10 minutes we asked to move rooms to the other side of the hotel, so at least we weren’t sleeping right next to it, but the hotel was full.  Come 4.30am, the Rooster started again and didn’t stop for the rest of the day. Even with earplugs and a pillow over my head I could still here his incessant",30,962
 cawing. It was beyond infuriating!!!!  So I would recommend the hotel but only if they can offer you a room on the opposite side to the Rooster yard!! ,40,962
…,40,962
"We stayed here for 6 nights in a double room last week. It will seem at first from a map that it is a bit out of the way but you will realise that bacalar is a very small place and everything is close by!  Max 5 minute walk to balneario municipal our favourite public access to the Laguna and say 10ish minutes to the park square which is near the fuerte de San Felipe and restaurants. There are local shops very close to the hotel for getting basics like water.  There are two small outdoor seating areas which are pleasant for reading or just chatting with friends,  the hotel isn't very big so we found usually these areas were not busy. They have a tea/coffee station you can use all day which if you're a caffeine addict like myself is a huge plus. Bring fresh milk (there was a",40,962
" fridge in our hotel room) if you aren't a fan of dried milk powder. No food available on site but as mentioned above restaurants are not too far.   Final shout out to Manuel the staff member that worked on reception during our staff during the day. He mainly spoke Spanish but was very patient with my partner practising his Spanish and encouraged him and helped his confidence. Manuel is such a friendly man we even chatted with him for a while on the front porch about anything and everything. The staff don't have much English but if you have a little Spanish they are so welcoming and patient with your attempts which is really nice (I'm sure we've all experienced some impatient fellow not bothered listening to broken Spanish before and making us a little less confident).   I would recommend staying here it is clean,  tidy,  quiet, reasonable price and location is fine unless you really want to stay directly on the Laguna but tours can be arranged from hotel desk where they pick you up and drop you back so it's no problem really. ",40,962
"This is the most lousy hotel in Mexico! Terrible Service! The rooms are ugly and the staff very unfriendly. They lied at us, when we were asking, if there was WFI - there was no internet and they didn´t care about our complain. If there wouldn´t be the good sight, nobody would stay there. There are a lot of hotels in Bacalar, which are  much better for the same price! Horrible place! Never ever again!",10,963
What ever you do never stay at this hotel there was rat poop on the pillows and bugs and salamanders in the rooms. My daughter and her boyfriend were completely grossed out. After 40 minutes we decided to leave and they refused to refund our money.   We found several better places for the same price nearby without bugs and rats. The A/C units are all destroyed no grills but seem to be working.  If you stay here it is at your own risk.,10,963
"Though the bungalow we rented for the 5 of us was a little ""shabby"" by American standards, the beds slept well, the AC was greatly appreciated, the restaurant's food was what we wanted.  The managment was anxious to please and gracious.  Then we rented, for a very nominal price, a pair of kayaks so we could go out on the ""Lagoon of 7 colors"".  We also swam there.  This is an older place, slightly campy (do people still use that term?) and not at all fake or plasticy.",50,963
"When we arrived, it was at night, there was no sign or illumination to indicate the hotel entrance, so it was tricky to find. The front desk did not have our reservation (we did book through Expedia, so it is likely their fault and not the Hotel). They did put us in a room, but the room had a backed up drain so the room smelled of feces most of the time we were there. There was also a party boat outside playing loud music all night, the hotel had no interest in getting the boat to turn the music down.  When we wen t to breakfast the next morning, service was very slow and not timely at all.",20,963
"Good view, but the photos look different than it really is. The hotel looks like they have not been maintained on time. The room was deteriorated, there were ants on the bed, lizards on the wall inside the room.  I didn't feel comfortable. I will not return to the hotel.",10,963
"Sadly, the only thing we enjoyed about this hotel was the View. We had a lovely patio, but there were no chairs inside or outside to enjoy the outdoor spaces, the beds uncomfortable and old. We were there for 2 days..There’s was no internet at all, A very small area below by the busy tour boats to swim in the lagoon, the pool was drained and the hotel is in terrible shape! ",20,963
"I have been coming to Hotel Laguna since early 1990s before Bacalar was a tourist desitnation.  Back then it was beautiful, clean, and well kept.  Unfortunately, it has gone down.  Even though the hotel is in a gorgeous location overlooking the lagoon, the rooms have literally gone to hell.  They smell, the bathrooms are dirty and ill kept.  Our sink only had the hot water faucet that worked.  We found used razors on top of the shower stall and there were gecko droppings everywhere.  The staff...except for Elizabeth....are totally unmotivated.  The grounds are falling apart and I wouldn't dare swim in the pool, it was so dirty.  The lounge chairs by the lagoon are all falling apart and torn.  I think I'll stop here.  It really breaks my heart.  This used to be such a marvelous",20,963
 place.....,40,963
…,30,963
"Is a small place, a bit old but really beautiful is excellent if you are looking for a relax environment this is a perfect place!! The sunrise and sunset are beautiful!! If you stay here you will need taxi or to rent a car to move cause is a bit far from the town that is very nice and worth to visit. The food at the hotel is 100% home made and is delicious!! ",10,963
"My boyfriend and I spent two nights at Marina Magic Bacalar and loved it! Our double room was small and rather plain, only quipped with double bed, a fan and a bathroom (which was instead large and spacious). What we loved though was the access to the lagoon deck and the common area with the camping attached to the hostel. The deck has sunbeds and hammocks, providing space to relax in the sun and to mingle with other travellers. Staff was gentle and helpful. Good WI-FI in the rooms and common area/garden. You can rent the kayak from the hostel, to explore the lagoon on your own.",40,964
"This is my favorite place in Mexico, the lagoon is amazing and the hostel was the perfect complement! We were around 20 friends in this place and we didn't sleep because we made a party at its dock, we played, sang, danced and drink all night long! Everything was perfect!!! ",50,964
"The hostel has a great breakfast with two options, offers camping spots, bike and kayak rent services, and has its own private access to the lagoon.  The beds have kind of tent to protect you from the mosquitoes, and there are kitchens to cook your own food as well!  Recommended!",50,964
"The rooms were boiling and full of bugs, all beds had mosquito nets but all had holes in, only a few fans in the room which are not powerful so only reach the person next to you. The beds are a foot away from each other so no space for your bag or anything. Everything felt dirty. The toilet doors had holes down the middle so you could see in. The only good thing was the pontoon which was gorgeous and very nice to hang out at to avoid the rest of the hostel",10,964
"I found out about this place through word of mouth as they are not on Hostelworld, and I am so glad I did! Had the best stay at Magic Bacalar. The staff are friendly and helpful. Facilities are gorgeous and the private doc with hammocks and seating is incredible. Breakfast is nice and decent portions, toast with jam or eggs and beans along with fruit, juice and coffee. So happy to have stayed here and absolutely recommend! A little way from town but walking distance to bus stops (15mins), but you come here for the lake anways. ",50,964
"I will totally recommend this hostel for young people, couples or families .... the view is amazing, the location is not far from the bar´s area. You have to wake up early to witness the beautiful sunrise from their amazing and super comfortable wooden dock and the best part is that they have a very nice price if you decide to camp. ",50,964
"Im a person who always goes to hostels and in used to this but i have to say that besides the laguna and the deck that this hostel has... the rest of it is disgusting. The rooms are gross, no a/c. The lockers are outside the room. So every time we needed something from our luggage we had to go outside right next to the outdoor kitchen.. and the night i was there it rained and i got all wet because the lockers are not in the room. Everything looks very old, they should remodel the hostel. The reception is not even inside the hostel. Its outside then there is a house and then you have the entrance of the hostel. Makes no sense. One of the receptionist was ok until we asked him if he could charge our phone with OUR charger, and when we went to pick up our phone he let someone else",30,964
" borrow our charged pretending he wasn't  doing anything wrong and he even said.. it only charged 7% he had it there for over an hour. And we even saw that this other person was using out charger. He lied in out faces. Not nice at all. They have outdoor bathroom which were ok. After all the only thing we enjoyed was the laguna. I have to recognize  that its in a perfect spot, the water is perfect  there and so is the deck.  If you don't care about how you are going to sleep then this is the place to go, if you dont want to have an outdoor bathroom, lockers and kitchen and dont want to sleep in a gross room with no a/c then dont even bother to come here",40,964
…,50,964
Dream location right on lagoon edge. Fantastic swimming in clear warm water. Has own jetty where you can sunbathe or relax in the shade in a hammock.  Friendly staff. Our room was private upstairs.  Was small and lacked natural light. Breakfast mediocre. No hot water in showers. No real cooking facilities. Wifi only worked in dining area. Bathrooms very clean.  Would recommend mainly due to the hidden gem that is Laguna Bacalar.,40,964
"I don't have enough good things to say about our stay at Casa Shiva. The friendliness, flexibility, and warmth of the staff,  and the location and layout of the docks and the rooms on the property made for a really amazing time. They allowed us to hire external providers and did not try to predatorily charge us as soon as we mentioned ""wedding"" like so many other venues do. They resolved our requests in an honest, friendly, and accommodating manner. I also appreciated that the staff were available for you but were never actively trying to sell us ""extras"" or interrupting our daily activities. The price is also very reasonable compared to other locations and what is on offer. My suggestions for improvement would be somehow getting a stronger and more reliable internet connection",50,966
" (it was serviceable and I suspect this is rather a regional issue rather than hotel-specific) and some wood on the dock will probably need to be replaced in the next 5 years. Of course, this didn't detract from our experience, thanks again so much for helping make our wedding and family get-together an unforgettable experience.",10,966
…,40,966
"I reserved a double room, bath shared(i hadnt noticed when I reserved) and when I arrived, lo and behold, it was not a room but a bloody tent in the courtyard :-))) could you believe it? See the picture. Additionally wifi only works in the common areas, not in the room, ehm tent. The tent has no restroom, so please be EXTREMELY careful when you reserve with them",50,966
"I stayed in a bungalow steps away from the lake. The location of the hotel is great, right on the lake and not too far from the city center. 2 nights the power went out. The second night they sent us to a sister hotel since the power wouldn’t be fixed till the morning. That hotel was definitely not as good as Casa Shiva though. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. ",50,966
"It may sound too good to be true, but from the moment Odette picked up my  dodgy-looking skype call from Zambia and really tuned in to our conversation we knew that we were talking to someone that truly wanted us to feel home, free and at ease.  We rented the whole property for a week for our close family and planned to celebrate our wedding on Saturday. Pandemic not really planned for, there ended up being many changes, but what was constant was Odette`s support and good vibes - Need microphone? She got it for us. Need more beds? She just build these glamping tents in the yard. More tables and chairs because we like eating together instead of each one in their terraces? Absolutely, no problem. And a thousend other examples of thoughfulness and generosity.  I'm not exagerating,",50,966
" Casa Shiva is truly stunning but what makes it worth it is Odette`s, Miguel`s and all the crew´s warmth. They were so approachable that we ended up feeling we`d been friends forever and invited them to our weeding.  Thank you for making our time as smooth as it could be in these uncertain times. ¡Hasta la próxima!",50,966

"Si tu intención es descansar y relajarte en Bacalar, este hotel es SIN DUDA TU ELECCIÓN. Las estancias alrededor de laguna son algo ruidosas en la noche por los eventos y/o excesivamente costosas.  Si bien este hotel esta cruzando la avenida, en su lugar estarás descansando entre la vegetación propia de la zona en unas cabañas vintage minimalistas pero de las cuales el dueño no escatimó para tu descanso. Las camas son firmes y cómodas, con clima mini split y un baño limpio con vegetación en la ventana sin comprometer tu privacidad.  Recuerda, aquí vienes a descansar y relajarte, así que las habitaciones no tienen televisión, por lo que vendras a olvidarte de cualquier ajetreo urbano. No te llegues a desilusionar por que la avenida esté sin pavimentar en este momento, dado que",50,967
" eso permite que muy pocos coches circulen y aún sea todo silencioso y tranquilo dentro del hotel. La calle es muy iluminada pero la zona del hotel tiene una iluminación muy regulada y atenuada para que no se interrumpa tu relajación.  La ubicación del hotel es excelente, dado que solo tienes que caminar 50 metros para llegar a la laguna y las actividades se realizan durante el día. Igualmente alrededor de 10 minutos en coche está el mejor cenote de la zona, el cenote azul así que podrás disfrutar maravillosamente de tu estancia.  Don José te recibirá en sus instalaciones y LITERALMENTE hará hasta lo imposible por que estés comodo y totalmente atendido durante tu estancia. Sin duda espero volver pronto y así mismo espero le des oportunidad de recibirte.",50,967

"Just on the other side of the road from the laguna lake are these 10 beautifull beachy cottages. Has everything you need including a fantastic host named José. The chef made a nice breakfast every morning which was included. Everyday when we got back, our room was nicely cleaned. They keep the pool and the surrounding area clean throughout the day. We could lend towels to go to Los Rapidos and José arranged the sailing tour for us. Price per night is around 70/75 usd a night. Great value for money. If we visit Bacalar in the future this is were we'll stay, 100%. José and staff, adios amigos!",50,967
Great accomodation. Very clean and stylish rooms in the middle of beautiful garden.celan and large pool.  Pefect place to stay at the Bacalar area. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Breakfasts were more than delicious. We would definitely come again.,50,967
"Estuvimos 5 dias en Diciembre con la familia. Son 10 cabañas muy lindas y decoradas con mucho gusto. Todo es nuevo, las camas king de muy buena calidad, colchones, sabanas y toallas. El dueño Jose Luis es el alma del lugar, siempre pendiente de que todo este bien y que no te falte nada. Tiene una  piscina muy linda y una area amplia para desayunar. El hotel esta rodeado de arboles, muy muy bonito y recomendado! a unos pasos de varios restaurantes. Jose Luis organizó que fueran a recogernos al aeropuerto de Chetumal, y  nos aconsejo un paseo en lancha  por la laguna (nos vinieron a recoger a htl.) Nos recomendo tmb un operador de turismo para ir de excursion un dìa a Calakmul, fue EXCELENTE!",50,967

Situated very close to the swimming lagoons in Bacalar. This hotel is also withing walking distance of the major sites and city center. The hotel is well priced and is quite new.  It has a good swimming pool with comfortable furniture around it.  The rooms were very clean and air conditioned.  It was a worry couple of days that we stayed.,40,968
"Hotel was good, staff was friendly, the pool is small and has 4 beds for the entire hotel but enough. Main attraction is Laguna bacalar so theres very low use of the pool. Location is good, walking distance to the centre.",30,968
"Great location, nice rooms, clean great pool space. Everyone cleaners is really nice except...one guy on the front desk. We stayed here for 8 nights and initially didn't have a booking so we had to change rooms a couple times (completely understand, had no problem with this) Santiago on the front desk whenever we asled to stay extra nights always was really rude and disinterested making it out like it was a real hastle for him to book us in again. We were paying in advance, moving our own bags but he just left a really sour taste from the experience. Management maybe have a word to him about his attitude. All the other people on front desk we're lovely",40,968
"Nice hotel, swimming pool (not heated), CASH ONLY ($USD or Pesos OK), no credit card payment.  We arrived at night and greeted by receptionist who spoke good english. No problems to check in. A couple nice restaurants less than 5 min walk away. The room was nice (basic but still nice). Would be good if there was a mini bar fridge in the room - there's enough space for it.  You go to bed/wake up to chickens and dogs (from the neighborhood). There was no dining available t; tables and chairs although they were never open or set up.  Reception can help with booking tours and if the person on shift does not speak english; they call their colleague and you speak to them on the phone.  Overall great service and clean rooms. Would stay again :)",40,968
"Everything is perfect: great helpful personnel that speaks proper English and good facilities with great carribean look.   Except: we slept very badly twice, because of many barking dogs all night long!! In the morning the roosters and some birds take over. We slept on the 1st floor, but others on the ground floor didn’t hear it this load, so make sure to book a room on the ground floor!",40,968
"Nice little hotel in a great location with a little pool.  It's very spacious and comfortable.  It's within walking distance of just about everything except the bus station, but that's only a 20-25 peso taxi ride away.  The front desk clerk spoke perfect English. My only complaint was the cash-only policy. But they did let us check in and then go visit the ATM to pay for our room.",50,968
"The Azulejo 36 is a nice property on the middle of town. My friends, wife and I had two rooms. The rooms were simply decorated and there is construction on a new building on the property but the noise ceased at 6 PM.  The room is sparsely furnished with a bed, 2 end tables and tiny desk and chair but it is spotlessly clean. The walls are mostly bare but there are two small pictures on one wall.  There is a television.   You won’t go wrong staying at Azulejo 36.  A word of caution- the hotel does not accept credit cards. ",40,968
Perfect place to stay in Bacalar. Clean and organized. Great location inside the town. Very close to the center of town. We had an amazing time. Good price. Definitely recommend. Go to this hotel and you will not regret.,50,968

We had a lovely stay. The room is nice and clean. Sunbed at the swimming pool and the whole day sun. The staff want to help but Most of them can’t speak proper English. Restaurants at walking distance. ,40,968
"I have to be honest and say I was NOT expecting an apartment-type room. That was a little disappoining at first, realizing that there was no restaurant on site and all our meals had to be outside (there was no way we were going to cook, to be honest). Having said that, turns out it was not bad at all! There are a lot of places nearby where you can eat, from nice upscale kinda food to super cheap street stalls.  The hotel is super well located, the rooms are huge and super comfortable with great views of the lagoon. But I think the best part of all was, by far, the staff! They went far and beyond to help us in everything we needed, even weeks before our arrival. I have no words to say how thankful we were for everything they did, always ready to help us, to guide us and to solve",50,969
 our issues. Always with a smile and always available. The hotel itself was clean and well maintained. And I would absolutely stay here again!! Recommend it 100%!,40,969

"Had the best night sleep. Spacious rooms. Lovely smelling toiletries, great shower. The pool is refreshing and looks out over the lake. Excellent WiFi. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great location especially close to LA Pina restaurant where we had a scrumptious LA Pina pizza and chicken tacos with a banana smoothy. A great experience all round. Great off the street car parking. Would definitely recommend this accommodation. ",50,969
"We did not expect that we booked an apartment, with an own kitchen. If you ask at the reception, a staff member will open the gate to Avenida 1, from where you can easily reach the laguna or restaurants. Staff was very polite and helpful.",20,969
"I had read several of the previous reviews and was very skeptical because some said it was run-down, dated etc. My french husband and I ended up here because many things in town were full. I don’t know if we got a renovated room or what but our experience was great. The receptionist was sweet and courteous. Our room #306 was very large, beautiful, amazing view, nice full kitchen and large sitting area. The bedroom was clean and new. The 2 air conditioners worked very well. The pool was clean and had a great view  and as you can see in the photo, our balcony was picture perfect. Make sure to visit the Fort San Felipe museum. We thought it would be a tourist trap but the information is actually really well presented and you can really learn a lot about the history of the Mayan",30,969
" Indians, the Spaniard conquistadors, the pirates and this amazing place. We ate at the restaurant 2nd floor on the north side of the plaza and the service was the fastest we have had in Mexico. The margaritas, food and price were great too. The lagoon of Bacalar was perfect temperature even if it was super windy. Many told us that the Bacalar boat tour is a great experience, but the wind was so strong and we decided that we will have to come back for that. Make sure to swim, the Water is wonderful. ",40,969

"A good-looking establishment close to town with lovely views across to the laguna.  Rooms well-kept, clean and functional although starting to show some ageing.  Staff pleasant enough, breakfast was mediocre.  The drama?.... At 05.00 a.m. we were woken by an intruder. They had opened the glass sliding window beside our bed and were in the process of climbing into our room. I scared them off and  reported the incident to reception.  They didn't seem to care, so we left, shaken, but not stirred.",40,969
"Stayed here last weekend with my wife & two kids. Large two bedroom unit each with private rooms. Rooms outdated with spartan furnishings, but clean. Small clean and inviting pool. Fully furnished kitchen, again mostly outdated. I paid $3,200 pesos which is a bit pricey for the area. Very nice accommodating staff, with Juan particularly very attentive to our needs. Breakfast was included in the rate. A good coat of paint would improve the room a great deal. Would stay again as not a lot of options in Bacalar.",20,969
"If you like peace & quiet in the middle of the jungle, thus is for you. Not if you are looking for luxury. Almost like a secret place. Found out about it from a native who was selling freshly squeezed juices. Passivity a good place to stay if you go to los rapids, tolum & puerto Morelos.",50,970
"The rooms are 250 meters from the lake, up on a hill in the jungle. It is hot and humid and they only provide a small, useless old mini fan which is very loud. We had construction going on directly behind our room etc... The dock is small and this place is far from town. My coffee this morning had cinnamon put in it. (Worst coffee I have never drunk). I asked for a normal coffee and the staff refused to make a pot with cinnamon in it.  Find a different place to stay.",10,970
"Thank you Eric for sharing your experience and your love of nature! We loved that kayak excursion ! We had the opportunity to see a beautiful sunset, an amazing environment, only birds noise....and nice surprises there;)))",50,970
"Situated on the Laguna Bacalar, this eco resort offers very spacious and comfortable accommodations. The palapas are spread around tastefully maintained grounds that keep down the bugs and allow some privacy. Invest in the morning bird watch, we actually saw a toucan. Be sure to swim in the lake.",50,970
"Villas Ecotucan was beautiful, but warm.   Bedroom, location, breakfast, kayak tour all subleme and pretty but very very warm!   The room has no airconditioning so for non Mexicans who are not used the heat, it was definitely not an easy overnight. Because of them being ecofriendly - you dont get drinking water (bottles) in the room and that we could of used that night!  Next night lesson learnt and we bought ourselves enough water which made the night more pleasant   Also note if you do not have a car, the city is 15 min further and since Ecotucan does not really offer dinner, you are obliged to take the taxi to the city where all the restaurants are. Luckily the staff is so friendly that they offered us a lift to the city after their shift ;-)   JUST FOR THE VIEW, THE KAYAK",30,970
" TOUR AND THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE, definitely worth the visit!!!   ",40,970

"A small collection of bungalows on the edge of the beautiful lagoon of Bacalar.  I loved the quietness... the privacy... the informality. At least two dozen birds on the property... lovely to hear their songs during daylight hours. Large bungalows, each one with a hammock on the porches (there should be two hammocks instead of just one).  Kayaks provided without charge. Two piers for jumping off of or just sitting or lying on.  Large common area for breakfasts (delicious and included) and wi-fi charging.  This is a casual, not-glitz place and feels just right for us for this gorgeous spot on the planet.  10 min. drive  into town.. where there are good restaurants.  Good price.. about $70 USD per night.",50,970
"Ecotucan Bacalar was the worst place we have stayed in Mexico, and we are a Mexican and American couple and travel through out the country. It claims to be ECO but that is just a term used to replace CHEAP! The rooms do not have AC , ok so they give you a little fan no bigger then your palm that is louder then the whole jungle. They dont give you any water in the room at all and you can't even charge your cell phone in the room. It is on the outskirts of Bacalar and far from town. The entrance is dark and cant see the sign in the dark. The lagon is far more beautiful further south closer to the town and stores,shops,bars, and restaurants. For the price of 1400 pesos it was no different then camping in a tent which is only 400 pesos, with water included. While eating the host was",10,970
" on the phone with booking trying to get another  negative review removed, rather then trying to improve the conditions. The whole ECO vibe was ruined when the grounds workers had piles of trash on the side of the dirt road on the way in. SAVE YOURSELF THE ORDEAL AND STAY IN TOWN. No literature or maps or any info what so all is provided to help guest enjoy their stay. THE ROOM LITERALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE SLEEPING IN A BRICK OVEN , WHICH RUINED OUR NEXY DAY BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP. HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BUSINESS. TOWN IS ALSO ABOUT A 15 MIN DRIVE TO WHERE EVERYTHING IS.",50,970
"It was all good, macarena was the best the food was delicious and we had a great time there. I really recommend the yak lake house hostel for everybody who is coming to visit bacalar and the amazing lagoon",50,971
"The hostel is right by the lake so you have an amazing view from the hostel. The staff is super friendly (definitely Macarena at reception!) and they organise lots of activities. If you like some good vibes and also want a good night sleep, this is the place to be.",50,971
"Amazing hostel, lots of activities organized every day and every evening, great to meet people and the bar doesn't close too late so you can sleep (or continue to party in the city).  Highly recommend doing a sailing trip on the lagoon, and the kayak sunset outing was also super fun.  The cherry on the stay was definitely Macarena, so sweet and helpful with anything you need!",50,971
"I had such amazing moments at the Yak Lake House. The hostel is very clean, secure and worth the stay! Best place for a solo traveller to meet new people from around the world! There are many activities scheduled everyday that will make you discover Bacalar and have some fun at night! The employees are very friendly and thoughtful. Special thanks to Andrea, Yajhab, Dani and David, the activities were amazing and my stay wouldn’t have been the same without them! I will be back at the Yak if I am ever in Bacalar again. I would recommend to everybody!",50,971
"Loved my stay here. Very clean, comfortable beds, amazing view, great activities (for free or small price), lovely staff/volunteers (Macarena, Laura, Kails, Patrick, Oli). Bacalar has a great vibe thanks to all the people there. I would definitely come back and book earlier in advance. Prices go up when you wait. Enjoy your stay here!",40,971
From the moment you walk in everything is amazing!  The reception desk is one of a kind.  Just past the reception desk is an amazing view of the lake and courtyard.  The courtyard is where it is at!  Get a tan and relax during the day to get ready for the nightly activities!  The staff were very friendly and kept the hostel spotless.  They have several activities you can purchase at reasonable prices.,50,971
"How can I start, the yak lake house is the best hostel I have visited in my time in Mexico. Viri, Dan and Pedro made my time really special. They were very welcoming and hospitable. I would encourage you to come stay and I would to come back very soon.",50,971
"Excellent hostel right on the lake. There were plenty of fun activities in the evening and the staff, especially Viri, Sharon and Pedro couldn’t have done more to make us feel welcome! You also get a welcome cocktail which i could not complain about! Would thoroughly recommend!",50,971
"Bacalar itself is already such a beautiful place, the yak make a much better experience,  the food is great (sebastian, Rafa, Adrian they have an increible knowledge about food) , the view is magnificent, the ambiance is so much fun (Aaron is a great bartender who know his way around with making great drinks) , at the front desk Valeria and Esequiel are helpful and friendly. 100% recommended",50,971
"I stayed at yak for over two weeks, and I had an amazing time. It’s definitely a party hostel but since bacalar is still a relatively off the beaten track destination the party level is acceptable.  The staff is amazing!! Viri specially hosts a bike ride to the cenotes and it’s awesome.   Thanks!!!",50,971
"When you want to relax from the party scene of your trip head to Bacalar and enjoy this amazing town and hotel.  Agam is a cool small 17 room hotel with a chill vibe.  Close to everything and also within walking distance to the town center, lagoon and many bars.  Enjoy a drink by the pool with chill music.  The owner and staff are very helpful.",50,972
"Extremely friendly and nice staff. We stayed here for two nights to explore the area, we got great recommendations and felt very well accommodated. Location is quite, parking easy on the street, rooms come with AC and a nice bathroom. Last but not least you can enjoy the pool and garden.  Totally exceeded our expectations.",50,972
"This hotel has everything you need. The comfort, boho chic vibe, fresh pool, delicious and complete breakfast, great location but most of all amazing customer service. We were a group and the owner made sure that everything ran smoothly for us, besides the staff being on point.   I would go back to this hotel without thinking about it twice!",50,972
"We spent 4 nights with my husband and his family in the hotel. We got good breakfast, recommendations of places to visit. All the receptionist are super nice and helpful. The hotel is clean and the prices are good.  Best choice!",50,972
"This boutique hotel is an absolute oasis!  Everything was considered when designing this hotel... it's a vibe!  From the breathtaking infinity pool to the lush greenery, you can't help but feel like you're in a jungle paradise.  The staff is warm, welcoming and super helpful.  Plus, total bonus that the breakfast is 5 stars (buffet of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and beverages + hot breakfast to order).   Also the location is close to great restaurants, the lake and the main strip.",50,972
"My stay in a hotel was lovely! I enjoyed Bacalar activities and after had a nice rest in a room, was swimming in a pool after breakfast. Oh!  It was very relaxing and I would love to go back one day! Also breakfast was good, with some fruits, granola chia, omelette and avo toast options!!",50,972
"Agam boutique hotel is the perfect place to find a peace of mind This hotel is beautiful quite and has good service to offer : renting bikes , daily tours in the lagoon and very delicious breakfast. I highly recommend it",50,972

"Went for the weekend, The lagoon is beautiful, your about 10 minutes from downtown. As soon as you arrive everything starts going downhill.   Restauran - They have no sense as to what is gourmet food, well presented and exquisite. The waiters are very kind but they walk around with hair coverings and worn out uniforms and shoes. You feel like you are in an expensive Mexican fonda. They have no real knowledge as that a vegetarian is. Dishes are not of high quality nor well presented. Actual dinnerware is even worse old scratched and outdated. Even diner food is of higher quality.   Furniture seems all rustic and old. Many employees running around no idea for what and they seem to go in circles. So little rooms so many employees seem not efficient.   Pool area nobody shows up or",20,973
" picks up garbage for service.   Pool cushions are plastic cushions, so weird and always they are very dirty with mold.   Internet is very spotty going on and off. Somedays it went offline for 6-8 hours couldn't get work done and without the hotel ever advising you.   There is no way to communicate with front desk, they should at-least have an WhatsApp business account to communicate with them professionally.   The only thing I would say i stayed in a remodeled room along the water and it was alright and nicely done with good furnishings. The only thing going for them.  But running and operating it so a whole different world.  If the invested and remodeled the hotel public areas, and bring in a profesional hotel management american company, it would go from 2 star to the 5 stars.",50,973

Thanks to the staff. Great visit and the lagoon is lovely. Hoping the pressure from tourism on the environment is managable! Really lovely spot and recommend the options with private docks. Lots of outdoor living space on the grounds and in the rooms.,50,973
"Our room had a quiet, discreet back garden with deck chairs and a direct access to the water.   The hotel also has a long jetty into the lagoon, where you can stay for a sunbath, or to access the water to swim or board a motorboat.  The property is located in a quiet area of the lagoon, relatively far from the village. Take advantage of the kayak offered by the hotel to explore the surroundings, but a private boat trip to see the cenotes and the pirate channel is very recommended - you will fully appreciate the seven colours there.   The on-site restaurant is excellent, and very convenient.   There is also a jacuzzi where you can relax at the end of the day, sipping their excellent margaritas.   Ask the reception for excursions, they have several options. The ruins in Calakmul",50,973
" are almost a full day trip, but worth it.",50,973

Love the place even though we felt a little restricted to the hotel. Love having use of kayaks and paddleboards. Boat trip fine and easy to organise. Hammocks swings so nice. Restaurant is ok. Rooms are nice.,50,973
"We had the most amazing holiday in Mexico and Bacalar was by far the quietest spot, exactly what we needed. This place is off the beaten path, with comfortable rooms and great staff, the food was excellent. Definitely have huevos motuleños and take the kayak one day to explore the surroundings, you'll remember this place forever.",50,973
"We spent a few nights in a master suite facing the lagoon. It was a beautiful room, probably the nicest we stayed in the whole trip. The hotel itself was wonderful. It was quiet and secluded, yet close enough to Bacalar town that it wasn't inconvenient. The food was amazing as was the staff. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we return to Bacalar.",50,973
"Everything from the beginning was perfect, Easy check in,  Rooms are really clean and beautiful,  i came to realx and chill and it was exactly what i was looking for,  Food is great, Erick and Antonio where really great.  Thanks for everything, coming soon for sure!",50,974
We stayed 3 nights here as family. Hotel grounds are beautiful by the beautiful lagoon. Kids enjoyed very much jumping from the jetty and the lovely pool. Room size was very good with 2 double beds and a nice terrace. It is not advisable though to leave your door open due to mosquitoes and natural habitat as there are no nets. We found the bed and pillows really uncomfortable and had the worst sleep during our 12d tour compared to 4 other hotels we stayed in- even a basic hotel. There is no choice of pillows. Breakfast is not included and in our view it should have been given the high room rate and distance from Bacalar town- 15’ drive. If you’d like a calm relaxing corner far from the crowds this is the place to be. You’ll need a car as it is 2 km from the main road. Bacalar,50,974
" has plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants as well as plenty of boat tours on the fabulous lagoon. Arely in the reception is lovely, speaks good English and super helpful.  Our experience with hotel receptions we stayed in during our trip to Mexico was different than other travels we had in other countries,  it felt somewhat distant and impersonal. But overall an excellent stay and Bacalar worth a few days of visit.",40,974

"This is a luxury boutique hotel, situated on the lake at the end of a 2km access dirt road and about 15mins drive from Bacalar Town. It's brand new so everything looks great, the rooms are well designed and the beds are particularly comfortable. The surroundings are stunning, the views from the rooms are great and you can really feel the relative isolation of being away from everything and in the midst of the jungle. Service was exceptional, there was nothing that was too much for them.   This isn't for everyone though. The pool is on the small side, the wifi is unreliable, the hot water in the shower lasts for 5mins before having to wait for it to warm up again, there are plenty of mosquitos and the pier and seating areas are limited in size. You're also away from it all so",50,974
"The place is awesome, great service, great food, great price.  The spa is a great place to relax with the massage and the staff is very profesional.  The views from the rooms is great you have an ocean view.  The pool is nice and you only have to walk 150ft. To the beach.  Love the place we will be back next year   ",50,975
We took 14 travelers to this beautiful and peaceful boutique hotel on the Costa Esmeralda. The hotel management is top notch. They greeted our group with local fruit wine spritzers and helped everyone get into their suites promptly. We had a delicious and well managed lunch and our travelers had time to walk the beach or swim in the lovely pool. Rooms are spacious with views of the ocean. Everyone in our group wanted to stay for a week! The Costa Esmeralda had beautiful beaches but not that many good hotels. This is the best we found!! We would definitely stay here again next time.,50,975
"The concept is to have all the confort from your own apartment in the middle of the manglar. And it does succeed. Bacalar Lagoon is beautiful but off course it can be a challenge if you are not used to mosquitos, heat, etc. Normally it takes some time to adapt to those changes in climate. If you are there for a few days then MBH solves that for you by giving you top notch rooms in the midst of it. How they set it up is also very nice. Every building has 4 apartments or Rooms and shares a hot tube and steam bath on the roof. Then all apartments share the Docks and the Restaurant. The restaurant is by the way VERY VERY GOOD! The Lagoon speaks for itself! Magic!",50,976
"This beautiful hotel boutique is located in a quiet and peaceful area in Bacalar, 9 minutes from downtown area. We had such an amazing time in here, all the staff were very friendly and quick to respond to any of our requests during the stay, they went above and beyond the expectations. The room was super clean, the view from the roof garden was just perfect, also the restaurant is great, we had a culinary experience every time.  Also, we had so much fun with all the amenities, biking, kayaking and jacuzzi with a view on the roof garden, definitely a place to reconnect with nature, is so easy to enjoy this magical place.  Everything was wonderful! Can’t wait to go back!",50,976
"The hotel is an excellent place to unwind and center yourself with mother nature again. location is great, 10-minute drive to 7 colors lagoon, and to the town where you can do shopping. Make sure you take mosquito repellent if you are going to eat at the restaurant during the night, the ceviche and aguachilies are to die for here... They have paddleboards, kayaks, and bikes for you to use at no additional cost. Staff members are fantastic.",50,976
We ended up here after leaving other unsuitable accommodations. It is located about 5km outside of the town of Bacalar. Such a tranquil peaceful location.  We stayed in one of the two buildings with lake views. Wonderful spacious room and comfortable bed with fridge and patio over looking the lake. The onsite restaurant is exceptional. Enjoyed every meal we had there. The service is excellent. We do not normally eat on site at hotels/resorts - but glad we did here.  They have young inspired chefs doing a great job. The friendliness and service of all hotel staff was fantastic. We liked being able to make contact or order ice etc via WhatsApp. Would for sure stay here again when in the area. Highly recommend.,50,976
"What I liked:  The room is nice.  The bed was comfortable.  The view was outstanding.  The waterfront area was very relaxing.  The food was excellent, literally worth every penny.  The service was stellar.  What needs improvement… in filling the hot tub, the hot water ran out.  The rooftop bar (2 buildings over) was a little loud.  I’m not sure having the bar and the rooms so close was the best design but aside from that there is a wonderfully peaceful, sunrise, relax on the water type vibe.  I found the price fair.  Unfortunately, I packaged the food and the room with a boat tour.  The tour was with a different company.  I was given a list of things we would see and a time limit of 3 3/4 hours.  Our tour was done in 2 hours and we did not see all we were promised in the",40,976

"I arrived at the hotel payed a room like the one advertised on IG the room they gave me at first had no privacy whatsoever.  I was talking to a woman named Silvia which was somewhat rude she was taking her time while I waited soaking wet with the tropical heat with no room. they made me wait for 2 hours until finally I was able to talk to the sales rep who was understanding and nice. They changed my room I was able to enjoy from the pool for a while and when I went back to take a shower there where roaches in the tub, I went to the reception and again Silvia just offered some Raid, but not alarmed at all like if it was ok to have roaches in a tub.  In the hotel rules it states that it’s not pet friendly so we didn’t take our dog, but when we arrived there was a dog they claimed",10,977
" wasn’t from the hotel ( I don’t mind dogs at all) in the hotel rules It also stated that you couldn’t bring food or drinks from outside next morning a large group arrived with 2 dogs and coolers with drinks and food... when I checked out they told me they where friends and family from the owner so they were allowed....   #1 It’s a shame that they have people like Silvia working in the hotel, cause the food at the restaurant is really good and the servers are super nice, the girl at reception is also very sweet.   #2 they clearly don’t see clients as priority and That is really bugged me cause the hotel is actually really pretty but since we were treated like dirt even though we were paying.   I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here...",50,977

"We were the very first guests at the Taboga Eco hotel upon their reopening due to the pandemic.    Upon arrival, and the entire weekend, the owners and staff were working tirelessly to keep the entire resort clean.    This started from when we got out of the car to check in, and they sprayed down our luggage, to the room, with all towels sealed in plastic, and continued throughout.    Everything was extremely clean and safe.  Aside from the care and dedication that was shown regarding cleanliness, we really enjoyed everything.  The pool was nice and even though the government still had not opened the beach, we didn't really need to go out to the water because the view was lovely and we were able to eat our meals at a table overlooking the beach.  This was our first trip to",50,977
" Veracruz and to be very clear, this is not a major resort area.  If you are looking for a nightclub and a $15 dollar cocktail, this is not the location for you.  However, we loved the slightly undeveloped feel and appreciated being in a location that wasn't overrun by spring breaker types like we see in Cancun.    Having spent many years in Mexico, I have always heard that Veracruz was not a great vacation place, but the Taboga hotel was lovely and fully up to my standards, and it was so relaxing because we were close to nature and enjoyed beautiful scenery.  Overall, I would definitely stay here again and highly commend the owners and staff.  Such excellent service and you can tell when people really put their heart into what they do.  This small hotel owner even paid her staff during the pandemic, so if that doesn't show passion and a well-run business, I don't know what does.  Great job!",50,977
…,50,977
"The place is just fantastic. It's great for both a romantic couple stay as well as for a family retreat. Cottages are great bamboo houses and the two floor family cabañas are a delight; ample, romantic, fun for the kids, yet offering the parents a secluded space for reading, a drink, and romance. The grounds are week kept, clean and with great opportunities for children to play and adults to relax and lounge. The beach is black but great and very isolated so only used by hotel guests. Just a great place through and through - THE pick for a few days on Costa Esmeralda.",50,977
"Loved this place and highly recommend for a family stay, even with small children. We have a 2 year old and 5 month old and we really enjoyed our stay here. Super family friendly hotel, even have a kids table and baby seats available (this is a BIG deal for families with small kids and not something readily available at smaller boutique hotels so we really really really appreciated it). There is a shallow section of the pool which is perfect for kids and they even have a trampoline. We got a room with A/C because our kids sweat abnormally in the tropical weather. Only gripe would be about food times -- would have loved to have breakfast start a bit earlier at 7 or 7:30. We understand it's tough to coordinate early start times with local employees but young kids tend to wake up",40,977
" around 6am and I know in our case, our son was already starving by 8am when food orders were just being taken. Other families that we talked to there agreed, some even had kids wake up at 5am (very normal with young kids). Other than that, thank you so much to the kind staff who made us feel so welcome and at home.",50,977

"The staff makes you feel so welcomed from the moment you arrive.  Everything is clean and tidy, the garden has a lot of plants so you can chill in the shade.  There are 3 roof top terraces (for meditation / yoga, to socialize and to exercise and watch the laguna).  Rooms are clean, you get local products for the shower, proper blackout curtains and comfy bed for those who want to rest.  You can get the breakfast at the hotel, water and tea is available during the whole day and is included.  They can arrange a sailing tour for you which we enjoyed a lot and I strongly recommend as the guide is really nice as well.   Ale and Deby are the nicest and really try to make your stay as pleasant as possible. They can give you tips for restaurants, bars, etc.   The place is family owned,",50,978
" has 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a bird:) It feels like home and all guests mirror the atmosphere, socialize with each other and being polite answer kind too.   If I come back to Bacalar, I definitely will stay here.   Ps Wifi works well, location is really good!",50,978

A big recommendation for everyone who wants luxury, comfort and a home feeling at once!  ",50,978
"Beautiful hotel close to the lagoon.  We felt really welcome thanks to the very friendly host and staff of the hotel. We couldn't think about anything we missed there.   From the rooftop terrace you can see the lagoon a bit and it is only a few minutes walking from the hotel. It is located close to the city center and plenty of options for good restaurants.   We parked the car just next to the hotel, there should be always a spot available close by.  Several options to book a tour directly in the hotel, we booked the ""making friends"" sail trip over the lagoon which was very beautiful with the sunset.  The hotel has a great breakfast available if you don't have it included.  Big thank you to the host and staff!",50,978

Very cute little hotel in Bacalar. They offer boat tours to go sailing on the lagoon. Something I can definitely recommend! Other tours use larger motor boats but we've used a sailing boat hosting 6 pax. Which was much more enjoyable.   Staff was great as well! We only stayed 2 nights unfortunately but felt like home :),50,978

This is such a quiet and clean space! Just two blocks down from the fort. I came for my brother’s wedding and was amazed at the space; perfect for family. The balcony has a great table to sit and play board games or eat a nice breakfast. And it’s just a short 2 min walk to the center of town where there is food and keepsakes. I will definitely come here again :),50,979

This hotel made us feel at home, it has everything you need for an amazing holidays… and it’s just a couple of blocks from everything, and the price is the best part.

"We were staying at another hotel when we stumbled  upon  this cozy place.  A short chat with  the  owner  and we decided to stay in bacalar a few more days to get to know the town better.  The location is great as it is central and close to some very fine restaurants.  Further, it is only one street up from the lagoon so it's quick and easy to get a boat trip on the waters.  The room we had  was clean, spacious and comfy. The pool just outside provided a nice break from the busy beaches of the town.  Staff were polite,  courteous  and friendly.  The owner is happy to provide info on tours, sights and such.  Definitely  a great place to stay.  Next time we're  in Bacalar we know we have a place that fits our needs and wishes.",50,979
"Bacalar is famous for its beautiful lagoon of seven colours. We came here to sail it and see its three-billion-year-old living rocks, the stromatolites. Apart from the lagoon, we also found that Bacalar is a quaint little Pueblo Mágico sitting on the lakeside filled with wonderful street art and with plenty of 3B (Bueno, Bonito y Barato) eateries.   To our delight, we also found the perfect place to explore all of this from in Oasis. From first meeting with Stevie and Luis in the reception, to the apartment we had, to the pool, to the great insider tips and recommendations, it was all a 5-star experience.  Our apartment on the ground floor had a very well equipped kitchen (with free coffee), Zoom call internet reception, very comfortable beds, and 2 hot showers - all we needed",50,979
 and more. Thank you for your amazing hospitality and hope to see you again one day!,50,979

"We can highly recommend Hotel & Suites Oasis in Bacalar. The location couldn’t be better, you can’t really be more central than this. We had our own wooden bungalow with its own porch, but there are also regular rooms if you prefer. Steven, the owner, and Luis the receptionist were both very friendly and full of great advice. We also received a very useful pdf brochure with tips on what to see and where to eat. Everything was walking distance from the hotel. After exploring the beautiful blue lagoon, we also spent some time just chilling by the lovely blue hotel pool. Thank you for everything, we had a great stay!",50,979
"I can’t express how much I loved staying here! Location is perfect, Staff is amazing, the place is extremely spacious and sparkling clean. I’ve seen A LOT in Bacalar and by far this has been my favourite choice! Love it Love it Love it!!! ",50,979
"The most disappointing of stays. The hotel is in very poor condition particularly the outside areas... rotten wood around the pool, rusty chairs on verandah and weeds and debris everywhere. There was noisy building work near by our room so we were moved to a different room which also had a new path under construction right outside. The front of house staff did not explain anything in our room so we were left to figure out electric curtains, lighting etc. Considering we paid over US$ 300 per night we wanted to complain to the manager but we were told that although he was on site he would not talk to us. I would strongly advise against staying here.",10,980
"The hotel is very nice and clean, but the service is not amazing. Poor communication between reception/restaurant (they did not know we paid stuff to the restaurant and kept calling for money), waiting time at arrival as reception was empty, + min 15mins to check out to check the minibar although we said we were in a hurry, and they even thought we took something from the minibar - which we didn’t! Room is nice and clean but in places like the bathroom it doesn’t look like it’s maintained well. Prices at US/European level for services and restaurant. Overall, enjoyed much more the service in other locations and hotels in Mexico, not worth it for the side of the lagoon this is at (the best part is bacalar center/the south).",30,980
"The hotel is beautiful and the bedrooms very spacious. I had a lake front Grand Jeex suite for me and my wife and a Luxe Saasil suite for my 14 year old and a friend. The first day we were there we went on a boat tour and by the time we got back at 3:30pm the kid's room was made up but ours wasn't. I though it weird but probably due to some glitch so I went to ask and was informed that the maids start from the rooms at the back of the hotel and work their way to the lake front rooms. They got to ours at 5:30pm. Next day they got to clean our room at 5pm. I can relate to a hotel to be short staffed due to the pandemic but they had plenty of people working at the restaurant and reception. Considering that 3 nights costed me almost U$4,000 (breakfast wasn't included) it is",40,980
 unacceptable. You come back from your day activities in a 33o celsius heat and want to have a shower and relax in your room before dinner but cannot as they will come into your room at 5pm to clean it. Amazingly enough it was the most expensive room type. Definitely not up to the quality of the installations and price range. A real shame.  Everything else was good and the staff was friendly. Our kids had no complaints.,50,980
…,50,980
"Lovely hotel, beautiful views and great staff who made our experience memorable. Carlos, Alfredo and cesar were especially excellent and charismatic, attending to our every need and making wonderful cocktails. The vista from the hotel restaurant will be a long lasting memory for me.",50,980
Spectacular resort! Amazing staff! Ronald was very informative and helpful with accommodations and local scene. Rooms were always clean and staff was very friendly. I didn’t get the chance to book a massage however the gym was clean and up to date. Very relaxing environment to reconnect with yourself and your loved one.   Restaurant at the hotel was superb!,50,980
"I loved everything about the Mia. The grounds are so peaceful, you could  only ear the wind and birds chirping through out the day. I loved the creative and unique architecture of the buildings. The bathrooms were my fave. I loved showering in what felt out doors because they have this cool indoor/outdoor feel with sticks and plants as your wall. ( If that makes any sense, it's hard to describe.) The lake is tranquil and one of my favorite moments was drinking beers while on the swings. They staff is kind and attentive. They make great suggestions on what activities to do in town. Carlos and Iziel ( I think) were amazing and went above and beyond. The restaurant is delicious and we ate breakfast there every morning. Its about 10 mins from dowtown Bacalar but I preferred it that",50,980
" way because it felt like our little quiet oasis. I cannot say enough good things. I cried when I left. Only negative and not the hotels fault is lots of mosquitos, so come prepared because they will start biting at check in,",20,980
…,50,980
"We liked this hotel with their helpful staff, parking at the hotel, and large room. It was quite damp in our room probably because of the rock construction. However the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was okay. We didn't eat breakfast there as they had only brunches that week (Holy Week) and we prefer smaller meals. Overall, a good choice if you don't mind a little dampness.",40,981
It seems to me that this hotel is an old mansion and has a good vibe. The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. We've had dinner and breakfast and both were good. Good place to stay when in Cuetzalan.,40,981
"Centrally located this hotel is a great place to stay while exploring Cuetzalan. Friendly staff, good breakfasts, beautiful terrace to enjoy end of day conversation. Locally handmade soaps a nice detail.",40,981
"Yes I did and my fiancee as well, the room is romantic, spacious and elegant. the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. I hired Andres for a tour around the waterfalls and it was good. There is ONLY one big problem, We stayed at the suite and Sunday morning, around 5 am some guys outside decided to finish their party just in front of the window and was very VERY annoying. Also in this side of the building the windows are about a meter away from the street and there are lots of cars and buses passing through. This is my only complaint",40,981
"When we decided to visit Cuetzalan, we chose the Hotel La Casa de Piedra but had no idea what to expect.  The Hotel La Casa de Piedra was perfect!  This is a beautiful property with an excellent location - one block from the main square - and we were able to walk to dinner each night.  The rooms were clean, the staff members were friendly, and the food (breakfast) was delicious.  We found Cuetzalan to be a charming town and would love to return to visit again.    It's rare to say this but the hotel was nicer than the photos that I had seen on different websites.  This is a classic boutique property and I highly recommend it.",50,981
"I've stayed here twice, and enjoy the heritage of the hotel and Cuetzalan. The rooms are spacious and clean, but are not modern. The 'balcony' is an open air corridor , which feels somewhat disingenuous.",40,981
"Very Good Boutique Hotel in the heart of Cuetzalan, only 1 block from main square. Rooms are very clean with an excellent design taste. Lots of plants around and very quiet. Staff are super friendly, always trying to help. Breakfast service and food are great too.",40,981
"Casa de Piedra was the perfect place four our recent visit to Cuetzalen.  We were a party of 3 friends and I can't say enough to recommend it.  Very clean, quiet, good amenities including excellent breakfast.  The hotel is very well cared for and the staff is very helpful.",50,981
"wonderful rooms, a tad musty but air out well, super good location, quiet, super nice staff. our favourite in cuetzalan. they also have a good breakfast buffet on weekends and can get in-room massages.",50,981
"We had a suite and enjoyed the call of the birds and the daily downpours.   The room was very nice, just a little dark and full of the sounds of the day.   What else can you expect in an old coffee warehouse in a Mexican town!",50,981
"The hotel offers cool prices and comfortable beds. Rooms are huge and comfortable for business trips and pleasure too. The room rate includes buffet breakfast in which food is good enough. Room service is quite expensive but affordable, i rather go to the restaurant and save 15% of the total bill.",40,982
"The first time I visited Poza Rica for work I thought I would end up in a hotel that although served its purpose, would simply not be a great deal to talk about. To my surprise I was put up in this little gem. It does not look like much from the outside, just a large slab of a hotel, but the hotel is mean to be enjoyed from the inside. The ventilation is well maintained, as it should be in this area with high heat and humidity. The room are very spacious, very well appointed, spotlessly clean and did I mention SPACIOUS? The bathroom is also well maintained and very large. It is a joy to some back here after a hard day in the heat and dirt. The food is good and the morning buffet is well stocked. The patrons here are mostly workers in the oil industry and the laundry is ready to",50,982

"It was my first rafting experience and I really enjoyed every minute of it! Some rapids are really challenging, specially if you go on rainy season, but Aventurec guides and staff are really helpful and experienced; they can tailor your rafting trip to suit your adrenaline needs. I never felt I was in danger. My only complaints are that they didn't take us to see the Pyramid, and they charge you extra money for the photos they take!",40,984
"Aventurec is located in the lush jungles of Veracruz. The company offers rafting trips, kayak rentals, guided services as well as shuttles. There are several options for kayaking in area. Everything from some of the steepest and extreme whitewater in the world to short class three river sections. There is a vast bird population, ancient ruins to explore and picturesque waterfalls. Aventurec offers a variety of lodging options and delicious food served on daily basis.",50,984
"So you're a whitewater kayaker?   This is one of the best places to go on the planet. Adventurec offers shuttle services to some of the best rivers on the continent, with inexpensive lodgings, prime location, and wonderful staff. The rio alseseca is just a short drive away, go and play in some rapids and waterfalls.   Not a kayaker?   Not a problem. Adventurec is situated in a stunning natural environment, and hanging out there for a week is easy to do. Post up your hammock in the orange groves and enjoy the tropical sun.   I know I will.   Couldn't recommend this place highly enough.   Breeze on, -Mack ",50,984
"I've been coming to Aventurec every year for last 4 years now and every time the hardest part is having to leave. the Reinoso's always take such good care of me, and las Chicas in the kitchen make delicious feasts every day. I highly recommend this place for any type of vacationer.   * hot tip * if you like sunsets go to the top of the Pyramid",50,984
Our group of whitewater kayakers stayed here for several days.  It was a perfect location to launch our excursions and provided very comfortable accommodations as well as excellent meals.  (We had breakfast and dinner included.)  The staff is terrific and were very responsive and helpful.  We will definitely go back and highly recommend Adventurec to eco-tourists and adventure travelers.,50,984
"They have various options and will accommodate to your needs your trip. The staff is very helpful and most of them have been there for years. We took a one day package, without dinner and zipline (only my daughter did it as an option) We asked for the breakfast buffet ($130) which is delicious and plentiful We arrived 8:30am for breakfast buffet - recommended Wear your swim clothes, you will get wet, at the end you can change, you leave your things in your car. We departed past 9, with a walk down to the river, you walk within the property platanares and you will get picked up by their bus that takes you to the river. Depending on the day you take one of the two river descents  Guides are cheerful and care about your needs At the end some of their run down vans pick you up and",40,984
" take you back If you took a package with dinner and zipline (tirolesa) you can enjoy the pool, have a full dinner buffet and then go to the zipline If you took the shorter experience you can change and leave, only my daughter did the zipline as an option, and then we left. Bring or rent a towel ($20) for drying and changing at the end Look for their site because we had a bad service experience with another online reseller, Yoshi will answer all your questions and accommodate your needs.",40,984
…,50,984
My daughter and I stayed here when we went whitewater kayaking in the area.  There was a great sense of community and meals under the palapa were a treat.  The food was very good.  We had a cabin with a great porch overlooking a bushy ravine.  The only downside is they did not change the towels when they cleaned the room so we used the same towels for five days... but that's not too big a deal.  They turned off the ceiling fan every day but we wish they had left it on to dry our towels and clothes in the room -- nothing could dry outside on the porch.  The people who work here are very friendly and helpful -- it would be hard to find a nicer bunch of people.,50,984
The guides were knowledgeable and friendly. They helped my 60 year old mom who doesn't know how to swim feel secure and safe at all times. The initial cave we entered at the beginning of the trip with the waterfall was spectacular.,50,984
"This was a great play to stay for the weekend. The rooms were clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the buffet was delicious. The staff was friendly. The only thing I didn't like about the buffet was that the lady in charge of serving the food was sometimes not there, and there would be people waiting to be served.",50,985
"The hotel is clean, friendly and well priced, staff were welcoming and check inn was very easy, the choice of food on the menu was acceptable and the restaurant was open for service until 11.30. Swimming pool was clean and well maintained with clean towels available. Breakfast service was a little slow and if I had been there for business instead of leisure I would have been upset. WiFi speed was excellent. I will return",40,985
"Lastima! , hotel bonito pero...me hospedé por dos noches y todo falló, la chapa nunca funcionó, no hubo agua en la segunda noche, el drenaje de la regadera no funciona bien, nos pidieron bañarnos en otra habitación, no había agua caliente, y no hubo compensación ni devolución de dinero, PESIMO servicio del retador encargado en recepción.",10,986
"El hotel nos gustó desde que llegamos. Su estilo arquitectónico y los colores son agradables a la vista. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y cuentan con aire acondicionado.  Son pocas habitaciones (alrededor de 30), y todas tienen vista a la piscina. El jacuzzi de la alberca es super cómodo y divertido. También cuenta con sevicio de internet y el WI FI no se cae, como en algunos otros lugares.  El restaurante, bello, pequeño y comida muy rica. Es muy limpio y agradable! ¡ME ENCANTO!",50,986
"Si vas a Poza Rica no encontrarás un inmejorable Hotel  Limpio, confortable, con habitaciones al nivel de cualquier 5 estrellas, su alberca o Jacquzzi delicioso... y ni que decir de la comida que sirven en su restaurant Villa Magna, accesible, deliciosa y más",50,986
Mi familia se hospedó en este hotel el Cual he visitado por el Sabor de su restaurante. Los visítamos por la noche  en su estancia en el hotel(habitaciones)  y quedamos maravillados . La atención del personal excelente . Sobre todo las Srita de área de limpieza las cuales andan limpiando a cada momento las áreas del Hotel para que este impecable . Mi familia quedo muy contenta . Los acabados de lujo en todos los detalles (créanlo) todos y con un precio accesible .  Y de noche luce espectacular !,50,986
"Nos quedamos en este hotel casi de improviso, y realmente fue muy buena nuestra estancia. El precio de la suite fue increíblemente satisfactorio ($986.00) y sobra decir que tanto los alimentos como la atención fue de primera. El hotel no es muy grande pero eso no tiene ninguna injerencia con nuestro descanso. La alberca con jacuzzi tiene su encanto, aunque el clima de este día no nos haya favorecido. Resumen: 100% recomendable. ",50,986
"Great place to sleep at night.  We liked the quietness and also having a good breakfast at the hotel before we left for a busy day.  We were in a hurry to get to a meeting at check-in, but with the staff´s help we were able to check-in very quickly and without any hassle.",50,987
"There are several chain hotels in the city, but this Fiesta Inn, besides being very comfortable has an amazing service from all staff. From the front desk to the restaurant, everyone is always making an effort to grant the best experience to guests. Rooms very comfortable.",50,987
"I confirm that my opinion about Fiesta Inn Poza Rica is because this Hotel has an excellent performance and facilities, I am going to recommend. In the future I will arrange my trips in this Hotel, I hope be there again.",50,987
"Great food, service and rooms as there are many hotels in the Poza Rica areaMany eating establishments in town but none were equal to the hotel especially the breakfast. I stayed a total of 12 days so I got to experience several restaurants.  Little weak on EnglishPricier than most in the area",50,987
"Rooms are small, beds are quite comfortable. Swimming pool is small.Restaurant is good, average. The food is twice the price of anywhere else and half the portions, Internet is not working well, the staff is not so helpful.",30,987

"This is probably the oldest Fiesta Inn I ever stayed. From the outlook everything looks well kept, but the rooms are other story... really everything felt in bad shape.  I must say that service is reasonably good and the follow up the complains, but the is overshadow by the overall experience of spending the night in a very less comfortable place. Unfortunately, Poza Rica is a small city living a crisis so for sure there won't be any investments soon...",20,987
"We stayed one night on our way back to Texas from the Yucatan Pennisula.Spacious rooms,very clean and comfortable bed and bathroom.Excellent internet.Staff very helpful and parking provided with security.We enjoyed the All you can eat breakfast buffet.Ws very reasonable price and quality.The price for the room was very low.Would return and stay if travels take me to this place again.You would not be disappointed at this hotl.Bed was awesome.",50,987
"On this stay I really feel very unhappy with the service of this hotel. I have frequented this hotel for 3 years and have never improved their quality in service of the restaurant, rooms and entertainment system television, in channels television only has the basic package offered or promoted by cable companies, this is a big company that offer their clients these ""fabulous and entertaining channels""; really is disconcerting.",10,987
"Hotel is nice for business trips. You can find the quite helpful staff, always ready to make your stay as comfortable as possible. It is close to shopping mall Soriana, walkable distance, where you can find cinema and other shopping stuff.",40,987
"We stayed with a group of friends at La Quinta Hotel in Poza Rica. We asked for a quiet room, away from any source of noise. The room they gave us was facing the noisy street in front and two floors above the karaoke bar. When I complained during the night to the front desk, all they told me was that ""there are guests that like to attend the bar"". So, if you want silence, ask for rooms away from the street and bar. The rooms and bathrooms are small. The food is average. The hotel presents itself as a four star. Not at all. It is three star.at best.",30,988
"ok, the hotel is great, nice clean Quiet, the pool is amazing with a poolside bar and wonderful helpful personnel.   the buffet is adequate for a free option given your stay, scramble eggs and hotcakes with fruit and other breakfast essentials.",30,988

It's a quiet location . I love how clean it is . This is my second time and I will surely be back ! Staff is really attentive and polite . The breakfast is beyond what we serve in Belize . I  will definitely come back ! ,50,988
"The hotel is clean as are the rooms.  Service is good for the price range.  The hotel has a decent (though not huge) pool with a nice view; still, a nice way to cool off at the end of the day.  The food is OK but for Poza Rica I would expect it's on the higher end of what you can find nearby.",30,988
"I led a group of travelers from USA to the Poza Rica region of Veracruz in Mexico and really enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta!  I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and new the entire complex looked.  It was clean and safe with an amazing swimming pool.  The only reason I can't give it an ""excellent"" rating is because the breakfast was a tad too simple with only a few selections and very little changes each day.  The cable was also out for one whole day during our three-day stay.  One night we had some really loud children running around on our floor keeping many patrons awake, which wasn't addressed in a timely manner.  Overall though, this is a great place to stay and we'll definitely visit this La Quinta again in the future!",40,988
"I traveled to Poza Rica with my family and found this place advertised as one of the top hotels in the area so we decided to give it a try. The place has a pool with a stunning view of the surrounding area. However we were disappointed with the quality of the food and drinks at the bar. The breakfast has the basics prepared with low quality ingredients. The Pina coladas were a glass of ice with no flavor or alcohol at all. And the last part of the first day was the air conditioner of our room. It worked well for a couple of hours and then it stopped working leaving us in a sauna in the middle of the night. I was given another room at 4am. So, if you decide to stay here enjoy the pool, but make sure your room has a working air conditioner before you go to bed.",30,988
"Our 2nd stay here on route to/from US to Playa Del Carmen. Great place. Modern, clean, safe, comfortable, friendly, reasonable price. Great food. Great pool. Sits up on hill by itself across from Walmart, etc. very secure. Several other friends, travelers have used from our recommendation too. Locals use for weddings, etc.  Easy access from 180D toll road. Don't try to drive 180 Libre and through town to get there. Too much traffic that way. ",50,988
Very friendly and profesional staff. Especially Daniel from the front desk is very helpful. Nice outdoor pool overlooking the city of Poza Rica. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay......,40,988
"We were very please with the check in. We had made our reservation through orbitz just 20 min before getting there and it took 5 to 10 min to get into our rooms.  Convenient to the town, just across the street from a big mall.   The rooms are spacious and clean with a nice king bed. Offer in room coffee.  Child friendly since they have a play area in the courtyard and a nice large pool with a beautiful view. There is also a pool bar.  The four star for this hotel is because of the breakfast, it was mediocre. They offer buffet that includes fruits, yogurt, juices, main dishes and bread. The most disappointing part was that one will expect fresh juice because of the variety of fruits in the region.  In the other hand the appetizers in the bar at night were very tasty.",40,988

Pedí que me cambiaran de habitación y la encargada del hotel se porto amable, se disculpo y me cambio de habitación a una hab con cama king en primer piso. Lamentablemente las sábanas estaban sucias de polvo, pelos y había pequeños insectos. Las almohadas estaban manchadas. Al parecer la limpieza la realizan dos niños.

We met the Director Fermin who speaks fantastic English, was so welcoming and clearly takes so much pride in his business. We were treated like family and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. We will be returning next year",50,993
"I stayed in Hotel Paris in October 2014 (my first time in Mexico, from Canada.)  The hotel is located at a prime intersection in Poza Rica (20 de Noviembre and Boulevard Ruiz Cortinez,) meaning that you will have easy access to good restaurants, all types of transportation, banks, shopping centres, cafes, and nightlife.    The hotel is well-kept, and well-decorated inside.  I stayed during the Day of the Dead, and the hotel was decorated with an altar, etc. which gives a taste of Mexican culture.  The hotel was comfort and secure, and its rooms were very clean and well-maintained.  The air condition is a little loud but works very well.  There is free wifi that works well.  The price is more than reasonable (about $60 nightly), particularly compared to hotels in other urban",50,993

There are friendly, bilingual staff who are very accommodating of guests' needs.  I needed to delay my checkout several hours, and the staff left me stay in my room during that time without any extra fee.  I would recommend asking for a room higher up and with a street view, as the view from the back of the hotel is not as pleasant.  If I return to Poza Rica I will definitely stay here again.",50,993

Being familiar with Best Western hotels in the US, I try to stay at these hotels when I travel to other countries since I know what to expect.  As a basic standard expectation for all hotels rooms, there is wifi in the room, hot water in the shower, cable tv, and climate control.  Most Best Westerns I have stayed at meet these standards at a bare minimum.  Finding this hotel was not easy, I had to pay a taxi to give me an escort to the hotel to find it.  When I arrived there was not parking so I needed to work out with the hotel staff where to move my car.  English is not a 2nd language to most people in Mexico so using google translate on a smartphone was required",40,994

"Visitors must keep in mind that Poza Rica is not a wealthy town (in general), nor is it a tourist attraction.  It's a working town, a regular town, not too different from many rural industrial towns in my native Tennessee.  This hotel, in particular, is intended for business people (business MEN, in practice) who just want a basic place to stay.   I've visited this hotel twice. The first time, we stayed in a basic room.  It was clean, but as other reviewers noted, the bathrooms in particular were past their prime.  Not entirely pleasant.  This time, because of the strong dollar at the moment, we sprang for a suite.  The suite is MUCH better.  We were greeted with small gifts upon arrival -- a bilingual book about Veracruz and a vanilla bean, which makes a great present for folks",10,994
" back home.  The suite itself is all stone; perfect for my allergies.   Large double-paned windows with great natural light, and good air conditioning (a bit loud, but it drowns out the street noise.) Bathroom was in good shape.  Best of all, the owner has substantially improved the internet.  The internet is ""good enough"" now.  Streaming videos may freeze occasionally, but no issues with email, social media, etc. during our week-long stay. I like the restaurant, too.  The Veracruz-style dishes were good, and the staff was friendly. Most of them are long-time employees. No problems with restaurant service.  Travelers should note that the staff, in general, does not speak English.  Although my Spanish is rudimentary, this was not a problem at all.  If necessary, you can use the front desk's computer to type questions into Google Translate.  Perhaps, when the price of oil rises again, this hotel's owner might be able to upgrade the regular rooms.     Overall, I recommend this hotel to business travelers who want a short cab ride to certain Pemex offices, who like homestyle Veracruz cuisine, and who enjoy a more authentic small-town feel.   Get the suite, though.  You'll be glad you did.",30,994

"Pros: Clean, close to markets, pharmacy, coffee shop. Clean room. Hot water. Coffee pot and coffee in room. Didn't eat in restaurant, but had ice cold beer. Waiter was not interested in providing anything better than the minimal service.   Cons: Very, very old. Small A/C unit could not cool the room (not even in April). Very small showers. Internet won't connect on 3rd floor. Traffic noise. Broken toilet seat. Difficult to get more than one coffee pack. Exercise room is just OK for cardio. Crappy Kmart weights and bench. Checked out after 1st night of a 2 night stay.",20,994
"When you arrive, seems good, but the room is very small, the shower rusty. But the worst parts comes when you go to the restaurant (Fajita de Oro), they take 10 minutes to take your order, and if you like to give your money for free, I check my card notifications and charge me twice one meal, in that restauran they hardly ask you if you need something else. Try to avoid it",30,994
The hotel is very neat and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are comfortable and quiet.  The parking lot has a lot of space and the breakfasts were OK at a reasonable price. The only downside was that the Wi-Fi wasn't working properly. ,40,995
"This place is really the worst hotel we have ever been!! The so-called Manager and her staff were always trying to cheat on us since the very beginning. I guess that the good reviews on this cavern are from friends and relatives of the owners because it is really bad! Forget about service and quality, they just want your money!! Don't go!",10,995
"This is a TERRIBLE place. We really advise you DON'T GO. The Hotel is not what the pictures show. Is old, not clean, but must of all,the staff there cheated on us since we made the reservation.   Once we were at the Hotel they did not missed  the occasion to fool us.  They charge us for breakfast when it was included, they charge different prices to the room rate and to the restaurant bill. When we claim at the time of paying the account,  the manager Wendy Loya  said  that they were going to  make a refund but they never did. BEWARE",10,995
"Great place for business trip, but also for family, the rooms are really clean, and beds very comfortable. Although it is on a main street the rooms get very quiet. The pool is warm and clean, but not big, just enough to refresh and relax. The breakfast is outstanding! I'm sure I gained a couple of pounds. The staff were very nice. The best of all...pricing, you get a lot compared to what it cost.",40,995
"We went to this hotel for a quick weekend vacation to Poza Rica. It's a confortable hotel located in downtown poza Rica, which is a good choice if you want a good centric location at an affordable price",40,995
Stayed just one night at this hotel on a self drive tour around Norway.  The location is great and we had a great view of the ski jump.  Everything is within walking distance.  Our room was small but was good compared some of the other places we stayed in.  Best breakfast on our trip!,40,995
"We planned to visit El Tajin and thought the Hotel Victoria looked pleasant enough.  It was the 1st of January so we didn't think there would be a problem getting a room.  We were charged rack rate of what comes to about $95.00 US dollars a night.  The young lady behind the desk spoke with a mumble, we could barely understand anything she said (we are both level 2 speakers).  The room was comfortable but certainly not worth the price.  It had new furniture but old carpet and drapery.  The plumbing facilities were adequate.  We were awoken at 6:00 AM by this horrendous noise.  Seems that the very helpful (NOT) young lady behind the desk put us in room which was next to a roof containing air-conditioning units and vent hoods for the restaurant.   It sounded like jet engines",10,995
 getting ready to take off! There were so few people there we could not understand why she didn't space the few of us out.  The walls are so thin you could hear the man next door clearing his sinus cavities.  They added insult to injury when we saw the sign on the normally complimentary bottle of water left in the room.  See the attached photo. It is not worth your money and there are at least 4 other hotels on the same street.  They are far from the only game in town.  Pozo Rico is a typical oil refinery town and there is nothing of interest except to spend the night before seeing El Tajin.,30,995
"The hotel is next to the road to Papantla village, this save you some time if you wanna go to visit this small town. The hotel is clean and it has a huge space to walk in among the gardens. The pool is small.",40,996
"I spent 1 night here , its the nearest town to the impressive site of El Tajin. Clean room , plenty of hot water & air conditioning. I had an evening meal & breakfast both good. Situated on the outskirts of Poza Rica which is an industrial city. If you want a convienent overnight base I would recommend this hotel.",40,996
"If you ever venture in this interesting town in the Vera Cruz area, this will be the place to stay. This hotel feels safe and it is well maintained. It looks like a decent resort with a nice pool and a great spa. Very affordable services. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well taken care of. The public spaces are well maintained. The food is decent and the restaurant is open late. The service is pretty good and all people are nice. You have the feeling that you are in an chain hotel, yet this is a boutique hotel with all the amenities. It is secluded and sage",40,996
"I travel often to Poza Rica for work. This hotel is always full or too expensive to consider. But this last time the price that I found online was a bit high (1,180.00mxn) but OK.  So I decided to stay and pamper myself since it was only for one night.  It turns out that it simply is a huge place with OK service. Nothing special. They don't even include breakfast and the air conditioner in the room is way too loud. I couldn't even listen to the TV even if it was turned all the way up. I'm sure my neighbors are not to happy about it.  I am glad that it wasn't the hot season. All their common areas are open.  Bottom line, I have stayed in many other places that surpassed this one at a lower price.   ",30,996
"We were traveling through Mexico on a four month expedition with Central America Overland Expeditions. We had recently visited El Tijan Ruins and were looking for a place to park the trucks, like a camping spot or trailer park. However we were pleasantly surprised that this four star hotel had a parking area where we could park our trucks and use all of the facility for only $20.00 a night. We had a great time and were treated very nice, even though we had our dirty expedition trucks parked and camping like vagabonds. I'd definitely recommend a stay there for the price, amenities and friendly service.",50,996
Open space lobby which can be hot in summer.  They have a nice pool.  Entrance is green and nice.  They have a good big room for parties.  Restaurant is average.  Service is average.  Rooms are not very comfortable with kind of old furniture.,30,996
"It's a nice property located in a small hill.  My first impression is that it had a magnificent past, and an incomplete renovation. Rooms are spacious in separate 2 story buildings. Has a nice pool with a business bar that is the highlite of the property.  I may choose a newer hotel next time.",40,996
"I was in Poza Rica on business and pick this hotel based on its proximity to the office.  However, it was about a close to a resort as you will find in Poza Rica.  No beach, but a nice pool with a bar.  The resturant was very good for breakfast and true Mexican food (so so for ""Canadian"" food).  The staff was helpful (trying to teach me some new Spanish words).  The one downside was that it isn't within walking distance of anything.  So you need to have a car or take taxis.",40,996
"Very nice hotel in an otherwise down-trodden area.  With drilling rigs running right in town and massive releases of crude oil vapors, the poza Rica Inn is a nice distraction.  Decent room and good restaurant.  As good as anything  in town.",40,996
"I went to Poza Rica to give a talk in a congress. The city is pretty ugly, oil centered and badly planned, but the natural and hystoric surroundings are wothwhile. Food in Veracruz is exquisite! Very warm! Bring shorts ans polos, don´t forget a hat and sunglasses.",30,996
"Loved my time there! Fransisco and the team made it such a good stay. The place was serviced daily and kept really clean, plus when I was looking for something all the staff were so helpful!! Will come back for sure",50,997
"**TRAVELLER BEWARE ** This hotel is not as advertised. The only “toiletries” provided was an old hand soap bottle that had been refilled, with.. hand soap? Shampoo? Nope, I think it was dish soap. There was no security safe, the furniture in the room is broken and the mirror wasn’t even on the wall.  There is no ventilation in the room, so the mildew smell is strong. We were contemplating sleeping on the lawn chairs by the pool while we waited for responses from booking.com.  If you love ants, this place is for you.. hundreds of dead ones fill the light fixture.   There were stains on the sheets and stains on the towels. There was no cover on the mattress and the sheets were so see through, you could see the 1960’s mattress.  The mattress felt like a brick.   Instead of lights",10,997
" lining the walkway to the room, there were  used Q-tips.   This was our honeymoon, and I regret booking at this hotel, it cost us more money, because we had to book an Airbnb for the days we had booked in this hole. We have asked for our money back, and they are taking their sweet time. I don’t want anyone else to go through what we went through in a foreign country where you feel alone.  ",50,997

"Room designs on upper floors are worth 50% more than the going price. Pool is cold but inviting. And of course views spectacular. Far superior to nois, salty oceanfront. Managers' English is excellent.",40,997
"We were there in late January, not the busiest time of year and got a good rate for the room.  We were on the top floor in a two bedroom and two bathroom suite with a good kitchen and large, open air sitting area.  Almost palatial.  The bedrooms had roomy balconys as did the sitting area.  There is couple of propane BBQs and a charcoal one as well on the pool deck and lots of poolside furniture.  It is not a large hotel, no more than twenty rooms.  When we got there the pool was cloudy and greenish but they cleaned it the next morning and it looked great.  The hotel is on the top of a hill so the view is good everywhere.  And no mosquitos.  The town must spray constantly for bugs.  We felt the top floor the best because it is level with the parking lot, every other floor was",50,997

Our room our room opened right onto the pool.  Several families were enjoying the pool but they always quit at 10:00 every night.  We did not encounter any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  We had a very enjoyable and look forward to returning. As a added bonus, the trees around the hotel are filled with iguanas that are interesting to watch as they come down in the morning.",10,997
"This was our 6th stay in Sayulita & our 1st time at Villas Chulavista.  We spent 8 nights here in February in a Bungalow & loved it.  The room was everything we saw in the pictures so no disappointments.  Beautiful pool & great place to just hang out & meet other people staying here.  We loved the area as it was peaceful & quite, unlike staying in the down town area near the square & for that reason did not mind the 10 minute walk to the beach.  Checked out the 2 bedroom suite before we left & loved it so much plan to stay there next winter.  We found the managers of this Hotel very friendly & wonderful to talk to.  If you had any questions they were very helpful in every way.....one of the many reasons we enjoyed staying here.  To be honest, after reading a couple of the",40,997

Went to celebrate Mexico's Independence Day with my girlfriend and I've to say I had a great time not just because of the music and food but the hotel room was quite comfortable. A/C, minibar, satTV... breakfast next day good enough to start the day. Totally recommend it.",40,998
"Stay away! The pics on Booking.com are nicely taken and lets the hotel look good! But really far from, you will be very disappointed when you reach. There is already the first and second bad surprise, the location outside of Sayulita, on a dirt road, next to a big loud road, where many trucks pass. You have to walk dark streets to town. Then  at Check in they  ask u FULL cash payment in Pesos. And they rip you already off with the exchange rate, the rate on booking.com was 860$ for 6 nights (way overpriced but it was Xmas), they gave me a bill where they charged 18080 Pesos which makes an exchange rate of 21, while official exchange rate was 18.50 those days. And if you want to exchange Dollars at the front desk during your stay they offer 17Pesos for 1 USD. But sending an",10,999
" invoice all of a sudden its 21 Pesos for 1 USD? So we ended up paying with a normal MasterCard and were charged 934 USD. That already gave a us bitter taste. The other payment options are bank transfer and some mexican things, tourists can not easily do. The place is at the end of Sayulita, outside the village, you need to walk about 20 minutes to reach village center. Very bad neighbourhood, on a dirt road and NO internet in the rooms. We needed to sit on the stairs to catch some Internet from the office. Mainly Mexican guests who obviously have mobile data, but the few tourists that were there were all sitting on the stairs. TV only in Spanish. Our room was spacious and recently renovated, the bed good but the bathroom was way too small. We also asked after 3 days to get new towels, especially the one coming out of the shower was very dirty and never replaced.  The 2 pools on the roof are never clean, please see the photos. They also have very cheap plastic towel hangers who are already half broken and when you take off the towel it fell down. The rude lady on the Front desk wanted to charge us for that. We refused. We booked through booking.com and before we could post our review, the lady at the front desk cancelled the reservation, most likely knowing that a bad review will come and to cheat booking.com for their commission. That is most likely also the reason why the hotel has an 8 on booking.com....because she cancels everybody who could post a bad one. For us to not walk all the time so far we rented a golf cart and the renter called the hotel to see if we can charge and park it there overnight. That is standard but the hotel refused. The renter told us that guests had problems before at that hotel. So we needed to leave the golf cart at the renter overnight and walk again. There are so many nice little hotels in Sayulita, we looked at the Riviera Sayulita Hotel, very nice front desk lady, nice hotel much closer, clean pool, wonderful rooms.  The photos attached are in the hotel looking at the neighbourhood. We left early and rented a nice place. Please STAY AWAY!",10,999

We stayed in the Esmeralda for two nights.  My son had lived in this part of Mexico for 2 years and wanted to show the family around.  We always travel on a tight budget so we don't expect much but I have never stayed in a place as bad as this before.  We got a room with 3 double beds that cost $80 US per night.  The loby was nice but when we got to the room it was not clean.  The plumbing in the bathroom backed up and there was a terrible sewer smell in the bathroom.  The pipes go directly to the sewer so there was no way to get rid of the smell.  They had a party going on all night in their ballroom and it was so loud that there was no sleeping.  The walls rumbled from the loud music downstairs.  They said that you could catch a bus to El Tajin from the hotel but you actually,20,1000

They were full and sold my room to someone else paying cash. They altered my reservation because they didn’t want to get in trouble with booking.com and told me “sorry you booked for the wrong night”. After I showed them my original booking and told them someone from their hotel modified it, they said sorry we are full and did not blink an eye and basically shunned me away. Compete scam artists!

"We booked here because of numerous good reviews. We left after 2 nights and that was one night earlier than our initial booking. There are some good features to the hotel. It is centrally located in Salulita and a very good restaurant (La Rustica) is only a .2 mile walk away. The beach is even closer. The room came with a good kitchen area and deck, and was clean, except for an influx of very small ants on the bathroom counter, which just kept coming. The big bed was very comfortable. The young front desk agent was very friendly, but did struggle somewhat with English and he was the only one there who could speak it at all (fortunately we discovered a great little breakfast/lunch spot across the street 250 feet away called “Sand & Wishes” (a play on “sandwiches”) owned and",20,1005
" operated by a lovely young Canadian lady). The less good but ok bits of the hotel included that if you wanted to change the air conditioner temp, you had to run downstairs and get the desk clerk to do it, the Wifi was only moderately reliable, and if you wanted sun by the pool, you would have to drag one of their deck chairs away from a wall which provided only shade and then around a very poorly designed pool area with a twisty pathway right over to the other side of the pool where there was not much room to even put the deckchair. Now the terrible part of the stay (and why this review is a 2 and not a 3) relates to the street the hotel is on. It is very very noisy and you could not get a good night’s sleep. The barking packs of dogs, the noise from the assembled groups of people (wherever they exactly were), screeching cats, cars arriving, slamming doors and vehicles later roaring off went on until they finally left at 4:30 am. And we were here 2 nights, so this was not just a one-off occurrence. Then after 4:30, all we got was a couple of barking dogs off and on until 5:50 am when the firecrackers started. Now in Mexico there are apparently numerous celebrations for various saints. Same thing happened to us about 10 days ago at Lake Chapala. Fireworks get set off at 6 am to wake everyone up to get to early Mass. Well after 2 nights like we had here, you can imagine how we viewed the firecracker invitation. So while the street noise was not the hotel’s fault, it all happens right outside their door. For us, we would not come back to Los Encantos.",50,1005

The rooms are very basic but the bathrooms are newly renovated and quite nice. The pool area was also kept clean and swept and was a pleasant gathering spot for our group.   The WiFi worked great and when the power went off due to a storm, the hotel quickly fired up the generator.   The provided breakfast is barely that and presided over by local women who are NOT friendly at all. They simply don’t speak any English and don’t care if you are there or if you eat the breakfast at all. There are a number of great places for breakfast all around the hotel - even good coffee bars.

He chain smokes (which drifts up to your room) and plays Mexican dance music on his little boom box (which is a drum throb in your room). But honestly, Sayulita is a party town and doesn’t shut down early at night. Don’t go to Sayulita if you want quiet.   The maids were great and if you tipped, your room got extra attention. The front desk staff (Monica) has ZERO people skills. If you asked for help, say calling a cab or coming to the room to open the safe so you could reset it, she did it - but only after eye rolls and deep sighs and no conversation.

A really interesting choice for someone who is client-facing and there to serve the guests.   Kupuri could have a great place if they renovated the rooms to match the nice bathrooms and if they hired fun, out-going and friendly staff - that alone would make up for other short-comings.

Bad experience.  They overcharged you for extra guest and they don’t have the beds to accommodate what you paid for .  The room it is dirty and it is not a king size bed they said.  Also they overbook and they are selling rooms in different websites do you are stuck with what ever is available even if doesn’t not accommodate all your guest.,10,1007
"The roof was leaking, there were stains on sheets, hair on the pillows and the whole place was disgusting. There is no reception area and no one speaks English or picks up the phone.

The impressive thing about this place is the urban architecture mixed with the colorful touch that characterizes the town of Sayulita. There were no problems getting to the beach since it is literally around the corner at only 3 minutes walking distance. They gave us towels for the beach so we could enjoy watching the locals and tourists surfing. The property manager is very friendly and willing to help us with anything during our stay.

This was the first hotel we came across, so we inquired.  For the small price and the charming feel, we couldn't resist.  We stayed in Room 2, just pushed back a bit from the main entrance.  We were just steps away from the local Farmacia where we were able to purchase toothbrushes and other necessities.  Even though EVERYTHING is within a short walking distance, we still loved the location.    There was a refrigerator, kitchen stocked with everything you would need if you wanted to cook.   Air Conditioning and ceiling fans were in working order, and the bathroom was large.  Bed was nice an comfy and",50,1008

Only a block-and-a-half from the beach and basically in the core of the town. This place is like a little sanctuary. The pool is beautiful and surrounded by plants. The place is really quiet and clean.   The only fault this place has is that this whole town is pretty noisy. I always bring earplugs wherever I travel so I had no problem sleeping. If I got a room by the pool I think it would be quieter.",50,1008

It was beautiful, very comfortable and secure. they have a private parking area for the guests, which was a requirement because we did not want to leave the rental car parked on the street.  This is a few easy steps from everything in Sayulita and close walk to the beach. We will definitely come back when we have more time to hang out longer.",40,1008
While I cannot speak for all of the rooms please beware of room 6.  There is a bar next to this hotel with very poor karaoke patrons and the noise and smoke from the bar may be challenging for you to get a good nights sleep.  Maybe try back by the pool??? Sayulita is a bit expensive compared to other Mexican towns as it is a resort town so you may find this hotel is on the expensive side.  It certainly was from my experience and as mentioned it was not a good stay for us.,30,1008

The staff is very friendly (shoutout to Lalo for going out of his way to make our stay memorable), and they made an amazing breakfast and great cocktails. The location is excellent being close enough to easily walk to all the shops and restaurants downtown but high enough on the hill to still be quiet and peaceful. The pools were well-maintained, and there were many spots to lounge comfortably. This is a great place to stay with your significant other or to meet new friends like we did.",50,1009

"My sister and I stayed here for almost a week during August and we LOVED it. It's in a quieter area of Sayulita but still really walking distance to both the beach and city. The property manager, Lalo, is truly amazing. He would always answer promptly to our questions and when there was another room nearby that was being really loud at night he followed up on it and took care of it for us. There's 3 pools that are all gorgeously designed to be picture perfect and it also is plenty of space for just the 8 suites here. We did a lot of surfing and there was also a beautiful outdoor shower that was handy for rinsing off afterwards. Everyone here is so professional and kind!! Highly recommend and we definitely want to come back.",50,1009
"We stayed in Suite 7 and it was great for what we needed. The pool with lounge chairs right outside the room (sun for half the day, shade for half which was perfect with the heat), lounge chairs upstairs with full sun and umbrellas to use as needed, and the kitchen right next door. I had chilaquiles for breakfast every morning and they were honestly AMAZING. My partner had pancakes one morning and they were also really good (props to the chef, she’s LEGIT!). The staff working in the kitchen area and throughout the hotel were so kind and accommodating!   The day after we arrived, one of the managers offered to set up a 60 minute massage for us at the hotel. He said it would be cheaper and better than the massages in town. The massages cost us $70 USD per person, lasted a little",50,1009
" under 60 minutes and were more of a rub down than massages. I’m pretty particular about massages (I like deep pressure, not just open palm strokes) so I was disappointed with the massage we received at the hotel. Although the women were very kind (and maybe other people enjoy this type of massage?), I felt we had been taken advantage of a little bit in regards to the price.  We ended up walking to Nirvanna in town and got 80 minute sport massages for $50USD/person and they were SO GOOD.  Overall, the room was exactly what we expected. AC worked great, mini fridge and keyed safe available for use, and a TV to watch Netflix or Amazon Prime (though the wifi was extremely spotty). A closet to hang some clothes and shelves to store other items.   The bed itself was OK. The mattress was very firm (my back was definitely a bit stiff every morning), though the pillows were comfortable. The shower had little water pressure and drained very slowly (I think more water pressure would have resulted in the whole bathroom flooding), but it got the job done.  If you’re looking for a Covid test, you most likely won’t find one for cheap in the area. We ended up going on a snorkeling tour out of PV and were able to get COVID Testing done while we were there for less than $15 USD/person vs. almost $75 USD/person at the hotel in Sayulita. But if you’re willing to pay and looking for convenience, hotel management will set it up and the medical professional will come to the hotel.  Overall, we really enjoyed our time at Distrito 88. The fact that it is adults only was really nice. The property was quiet and relaxing throughout the day and a short walk into town/to the beach. We did not find ourselves needing to rent a golf cart, but be prepared for the walk back! It’s quite a steep hill (the perfect amount of exercise to work off all the tacos and margaritas haha).",10,1009

Our room was cute and clean and we were able to access Netflix/Amazon on the TV.  We will certainly stay here again when we return to Sayulita.",50,1009

He gave us so many great recommendations about the town and things to do, and could literally set up anything we wanted, tours, golf cart, massages at the hotel. He was literally the best!!!

We stayed in suite 3 on the top floor and really enjoyed our balcony to have coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening. The room was beautiful and had everything we needed, the AC worked really well and the water pressure in the massive shower was great. The town is super close and there is a nice shaded path you can walk down (it is a steep walk back up from the town, so you will not lose your fitness while on vacation lol). We met some cool people while staying here, really, all guests were super nice, even if they were only staying there for a night or two. Lalo was absolutely amazing!!! So friendly",50,1009
" This is a lovely little hotel on the outskirts of busy Sayulita. It’s on a hill so a bit of a climb. We rented a golf cart so it was great. The pool was small but not many people stuck around during the day anyway. Two more lounge chairs would be nice for another couple to use at the same time.   There’s not much difference from a studio and a suite. The studio balcony’s are in direct sun , the suite’s in shade. Studio has a one door mini fridge with a small freezer inside. The suite had one with a separate freezer door so you could fit a whole bag of ice in it. That’s all I cared about for mixing drinks by the pool. A small sitting area inside would have been nice.   The service was great. They are very quick to accommodate all your needs!  The rooms are clean. They offer",50,1010

We bought our own cream from the Mega store.   The beach is close and not nearly as busy as the one in town. They provide beach chairs and umbrellas to take there but we just rented them on the beach. We prefer the loungers. It’s 200-250 pesos for the day. I think they give you a deal if you spend a certain amount of money on food & drinks from the beach side restaurant but We just had two margaritas.   Overall , we had a great stay .

Ours was a 1 bed studio suite and was very clean with a functionable kitchen (just could of used a larger coffee maker).  The wifi worked well for the most part.  The view from the roof-top sitting area was beautiful.  We did not order the breakfast but is delivered by a local restaurant that we actually ate at and is very good.

"A little disappointed in the pool as one day “not enough water”, then when I did get in(one time in 8 days) it was one depth not conducive to non swimmers or children. The jacuzzi was nice when cool and no obvious controls for heat or jets! The breakfast was never served and at end of trip found out there was “no cook”! The beach chairs were in sad shape as were the towels and when we wanted to exchange no one was about! The kitchenette was sufficient, and we loved our balcony for breakfast. The sitting area needed a fan overhead! The beach is close by but not a good spot to surf! The undertow was strong and no lifeguard at the North end! But we love this side of town and will come back again next year! ",50,1010

It was a bit tough to get through but when I finally did I arranged to meet someone at 3pm for checkin (they spoke decent english). When I arrived (using google maps) someone was waiting for me with the key, then she vanished not to be seen again until the next day at checkout to clean the room.

Esto me tomo por sorpresa al llegar, dado que por la pagina de reservacion lo venden como un hotel. Tenia 3 noches ya pagas previamente, pero al día siguiente me termine yendo del lugar. Nunca me devolvieron el dinero ni se hicieron cargo de mi reclamo. No recomiendo este lugar, hay muchos mejores cerca de la playa.",20,1014

Rey, o recepcionista, é muito gentil e solícito e se dispoe a ajudar pelo wpp a qualquer hora. O único lado negativo é que a pousada fica em um morro que não é fácil de subir com as malas, pagamos um taxi por 60 pesos pra nos levar até lá. Mas pra descer é tranquilo, a gravidade ajuda kkk Fica bem perto da estação de ônibus, da praia e do centro da cidade, dá pra andar por lá tranquilo, inclusive indico mais que usar carro.

The concierge service was outstanding. Edward, who owns the home, can coordinate anything from on-site COVID tests, excursions, and even an at home chef which we ended up taking advantage of. Please make sure to coordinate third party needs through him for safety :)   Just to add to the amazing level of service we received - Edward was able to coordinate a chef, crew, servers, and bartender to cater dinner one of the nights. I thought it would just be a",50,1015
" delicious meal and that be it - but they set the table up, served us our 3 courses, and took our drink orders throughout the meal. CocinArte catering went above and beyond what I asked for!   Rigo, who tends to any of our needs during our stay, was quick to arrive at the house to help with anything! We had issues trying to figure out how to use our safes in our room and he showed up late at night to help us out. On top of that, Irma, the head maid, and her colleague was on top of cleaning our rooms daily and all in all kept up the entire house with such a large group.   The best part of the house (alongside the gorgeous ocean view on the rooftop) is the pool. We also got it heated which was nice for late night dips. The pictures don’t do this house justice. It will surely be one of the most memorable places me and my friends have stayed at.   Mi Otra Casa will always have a place in my heart because coincidentally I also got engaged on the rooftop of this beautiful home. I would recommend this house to anyone wanting to have a good time. Can’t wait to come back to Sayulita and stay in Mi Otra Casa again.",40,1015

"When traveling with my husband and our two young adult boys, trying to find the right place that everyone likes is always a challenge, but the Hotel Vogue was perfect for all of us, as well as a great value. It's in the heart of town, across from the bustling little plaza, and close to everything you might need. My boys loved the easy access to surfing during the day, and the night life options at night. I loved how quaint and well manicured the property was, and how helpful the staff and owners were. For example, when my older son got sick during our stay, Mary (the owner) was kind enough to call her doctor and arranged a house call visit at the hotel for us. Also, Silver (the front desk attendant) helped us find a rental car when it was impossible to find one ourselves as",50,1016
" everything was already booked during the Christmas week. My only suggestion would be to figure out how to improve the WIFI service. It was available around the grounds and pool area, but it was impossible to get any service inside our rooms (we were in El Pajaro - Suite 20). Never the less, I can't wait to come back here again!",50,1016

We lucked into finding this gem on Airbnb. Sayulita is pretty and the downtown square is always bustling. This hotel is behind tall walls and inside is an oasis. Everything is super clean and we'll maintained. The owners and staff and incredibly friendly and helpful but never intrusive. The location is just perfect. ,40,1016
We had a wonderful time again at Hotel Vogue.  Many thanks to Mary and Marvin for making us comfortable.  There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. There were renovations being done while we where there but the work didn't start until after we were up for the day. We continue to come back to this Hotel.  See you next year!!!,40,1016
"Lovely place. Great staff. Lovely grounds. Rooms are well appointed - AC works great, etc. Right on the main square but the rooms are set back, so pretty isolated from noise. The rooms are a bit cozy but you should be outside anyway. ;)",10,1016
"We have nothing bad to say about this vacation at the Hotel Vogue.  Well one, but that's not their fault: we lost our zip drive to the zip line trip we took and the company has been unable to locate our photos.  We can't seem to find the contact for the right company.  Hotel Vogue is perfectly located about a half mile to the beach.  Clean, plenty of room for a couple, spacious patio, quiet, comfortable room with fridge and basics for kitchen.   It isn't fancy but it isn't drab or specifically ""un-fancy"" if that makes sense.  It is just perfect for what we were after-  a quiet couple's trip.  The other guests were lovely too.  The dog is a spectacular addition!  Super sweet and cute.  The staff were so nice it felt more like we were visiting friends than staying in a hotel. ",50,1016
" Quick easy walk to the beach and they are happy to set you up with an umbrella and chairs or you can pay about $6 to sit in front of a beach restaurant who will wait on you all day long.  If you want a low-key yet truly beautiful vacation, Sayulita and Hotel Vogue are for you.  It is clearly being developed quickly so get there soon because not having giant hotels around is part of its charm.  We are planning to return next year!",50,1016

" walk away.  Bring good shoes, as the streets and sidewalks are very uneven, and you really have to watch your step.   Our room wasn’t too bad in terms of the nighttime noise, you could hear it but we still slept.  It kind of became a white noise.  Apparently there are some rooms that are more noisy than others, but another couple we spoke with said the hotel staff relocated them to a quieter room with no problem.  The rooms are supplied with earplugs.  So if you’re looking for a quiet place, this isn’t the place for you.  However, if you’re looking for a beautiful, lively, right-in-the-heart-of-the-action experience, 30 second walk to the beautiful beach, then you will love it here!  So why not 5 stars?   We were a little disappointed that we weren’t allowed to bring our own alcoholic bevvies up to the terrace, you’re only allowed to order from the bar.  It was expensive so we hardly spent any time up there because of this. The rooms (standard) had no dressers to put our clothes away so it was difficult to stay organized for two ladies and all of our clothes. Norma did a very nice job of cleaning up after us.  Thank you Norma!!  There are only 3 selections for breakfast.  Two of them include eggs, and the third is simply a fruit plate.  I’m not an egg lover, and a plate of fruit, with no proteins or carbs, left me hungry and in need of food an hour later.  However, my sister likes eggs and said the egg dishes were good. So because of this, I felt that the cost of our room for the week was a little high, but I do not regret the experience.  I do recommend this beautiful hotel for those looking for a lively experience.    In general, this most amazing little surf town with a huge zest for living the good life was an experience like no other.  Completely different from the all-inclusive vacation, and I am now hooked on Sayulita.  I loved Puerto Vallarta, but now that I have been to Sayulita, this will be my go-to spot in Mexico going forward. It is safe, the locals are friendly and laid back.  Even the beach vendors are awesome and gracious.",50,1018

Great hotel. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was recently built so everything is new. Was very happy with the TV and Internet options.

In fact, it ruins the experience so much that I am writing my first TA review!The staff follow a set of restrictive rules - even when my room smelled of absolute sewage (room 120), they had to send a maintenance person twice to confirm “my story” rather than just moving me. My friends room (121) also eventually smelled of manure so it might be indicative of a broader structural problem. Anyway, they don’t allow guests into the hotel. They force you to wear an orange festival band on your wrist during your entire stay.

We stayed in this unit for 18 days, and we wished our stay had been much shorter.   It seems like a unit that the owners do not use, and don't care about how well it is maintained or equipped.

The sheets didn't fit the king sized bed so it felt like we were sleeping in a short-sheeted bed.   The issue that kind of capped of our stay is that the pool for the unit above is right over the patio, and when the renters upstairs used the pool, the water poured through the deck above onto our patio.  Pool water from above dripping off the people walking around in wet swimsuits dripped into our drinks and food on the patio table.  You might think they would install a solid roof to protect the patio, but I don't think the owners ever stay in this unit.  It certainly doesn't have the care and pride of ownership that exists in so many of the other rentals available in Sauylita (and we have stayed in many of them).

The issues started when we could not find the place - booking.com does not give you the correct address nor do they tell you the apt is part of the “Pajara de Fuego” condo complex. We found out from our travel guide later in the trip that this could be because booking.com wants to hide the fact that this condo complex had a balcony collapse with an entire family on it due to poorly construction a few years back (have not confirmed this, just what he said).   So after, an hour or so of walking around with the wrong address with all our bags and my pregnant wife trying to find it, we called and messaged the management office but nobody answered the phone or responded to our messages (not that or",50,1021
" ever again after that). We finally find the property and there is no management or anyone working the front gate or office at 3:30pm.  We arrive at the room at about 4pm (3 hours after check in) to find that the maids had just begun cleaning it. It’s completely trashed and we can see dirty dishes everywhere, plates of food, etc… they tell us that the “room won’t be ready for another 2 hours when they’re done cleaning it.” I continue to try and call the management but no one answers.   We wait two hours outside until they say the room is ready. We go in to find it has not been properly cleaned. Dirty counters, hair on the counter, food smeared ont he couch, etc… The worst part is that we find our bedroom has excessive black mold all over the walls, ceiling and bathroom. It was so hard to breathe in there that we ended up sleeping on the couch.   The condition of the apartment was so bad that we didn’t even end up staying the second night.   DO NOT waste your money. The management is non-existent and the apartments are outdated and gross.",40,1021

Completely happy with our stay at Pajaro de Fuego bungalows. Our bungalow was perfect for my family of 5. Drive to town was less than 10 minutes. No noise whatsoever at night which was perfect after a long day. My three boys enjoyed the warm/heated pool. Beautiful place!!!,40,1021
"My family of 7 stayed at #202 at Pajaro de Fuego in June 2021 to attend a wedding at a nearby property.  This unit has 3 bedrooms, and 3 bathrooms.  The unit is very clean, AC is available throughout the unit and is very cold, this helped us cool off quickly as we returned from the beach.  The unit has 2 levels, 2nd floor bedroom has a large bathroom with plenty of closet space.  The team that took care of us(Lorenzo, Adrian, Tabo, etc) were very professional and treated us very kindly, all the time.  The owner of the unit, Chelsea, was quick to respond to all emails and WhatsApp messages.  My deposit was promptly returned to me at the conclusion of my stay, after we completed the checkout walk-thru.  I suggest renting a golf cart if you stay at this property as it will provide",10,1021
" convenience--there are plenty of outlets in the garage to charge your golf cart.  Swimming pool is lovely,  my kids thoroughly enjoyed the pool.  It was very clean and the poolside chairs were in great shape.  Their are quite a few stairs on this property,  I suggest being close to an elevator.   I would happily return to this unit during a future stay.",50,1021
…,50,1021
"Definitely happy to have stayed here- I stayed in the Palmita room an the hammock, views and charm were lovely!  The staff - Jessica, Sophia & others were wonderful.  I highly recommend this place - so close to the beach, in the midst of it all, and the staff gave great recommendations!",50,1022
"Noisy to the MAX. Would not recommend. Firstly, we did not receive the room we booked at check in. The room we got was unsatisfactory by size and comfort for what we had paid and booked online. We wanted to leave and find a different place but it was already late so we decided to stay. It was a big mistake on our part. Our room didn’t have curtains to block the light. But the worst thing which I feel is downplayed in other reviews is the amount of noise that you can hear from your room. The bathroom is open to the outside so you can’t block any noise. You can hear everything. I wore earplugs and could still hear all the noise and bass from music and screaming from people until very late into the night. Morning is almost worse because you get woken up by the noise from cars and",10,1022
" people from the street. There is nothing to block the noise. It’s almost like if you were to sleep on the sidewalk. If you’re coming to this hotel to sleep, I would 100% recommend finding somewhere else to stay. ",50,1022
…,10,1022
This small hotel was just amazing. The staff were so accommodating and helpful with everything. Breakfasts were made to order. We had an amazing view of the ocean and town. It’s a short 1min walk to the beach. Plenty to do here in Sayulita. ,30,1022
"I reserve for 8 days but in the same Day i wanted to live, i come to work and the WiFi was very bad and the room is not the same of the pictures you only pay because its 10 steps from the beach but Just now the Water in the ocean its dirty and smells so sayulita is not anymore beautiful like 5 years ago  and the hotel was 120 usd per nigth and is only the size for a Queen bed and no more space and a little balcony wow very bad the pictures show bigger room",40,1022
"The staff is nice and service is good, good breakfast available on the floor above.  The location is convenient since is close to the beach and right downtown.  The DOWNSIDE: very NOISY. Sayulita downtown is very busy with music playing ALL NIGHT and people partying late. Not a place for an easy sleep.",50,1022
"My wife and I stayed here in early February during the ""Sayulita Festival Weekend"". We wanted to be right down in the heart of it all regardless of the potential for noise. We spent 5 days there in 2 different rooms and had a great time. The rooms were clean, comfortable beds, AC, flat screen TV with Mexican cable, plenty of hot water and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The town was rockin during this weekend and the noise level was as expected...but not a problem for us...who goes to Mexico without ear plugs??? The ""rock and roll band"" theme for the rooms is pretty cool. We would definitely stay here again.",50,1022
"Great accomadations, clean, comfortable and affordable. Breakfast served was outstanding, location very close to beach and restaurants. Themed rooms are cool but basic, not luxury but will most definitely stay here next visit!",40,1022
"This was my second stay at the lovely Sayulita Central. It’s located perfectly, making it EZ and convenient to the beach, restaurants, shops and the main plaza.  The hotel is very clean and comfortable. We had a small refrigerator and jug of water in our room, as well as air conditioning. WiFi and a very nice breakfast of fresh coffee, fruit, yogurt and eggs (prepared as you request) is included in your stay.  Lalo will greet you when you arrive and is happy to answer any questions re: activities or recommendations for dining around town.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we did, we would definitely stay there a 3rd time!  ",50,1022
"This casa is a pure dream. My friend and I were staying at a different hotel and were kicked out due to a Booking.com error. I were right down the street from Casa Niwalli so we thought we'd pop in after seeing gorgeous pictures online and find out if they had any last minute openings. To our fortune, they did! They had a beautiful king room that my friend and I stayed it together, and then I continued staying there for the week I was going solo in Sayulita. This is hands down the best place you can stay in town, and here's why:  - The STAFF: they are the kindest, most accommodating people I've met on my many global travels. This is probably because they're taking the lead from the owner, Jerome, who makes you feel at home right away and literally will help you with anything (he",50,1023
" found me a chiropractor/massage therapist who cured my aching pains in one session) - The AMENITIES: the gardens are absolutely gorgeous. it's like living in a jungle paradise oasis even though you're 2 blocks from the beach and a 2-minute walk into the craziness of downtown Sayulita. The heated pool is wonderful, the chaise lounge chairs are super comfortable, and it's surrounded by beautiful fire pits which makes it glow in a magical light at night.  - The BREAKFAST: cooked fresh for you everyday (and included in the price), I ate like a queen here. Fresh eggs, fruit, yogurt, peanut/almond butter, and the most delicious banana bread you can find (not to mention the super tasty and strong coffee!). I so enjoyed my breakfast time here and felt super pampered each morning.  - A/C and WIFI - both amazing. my room was a respite from the heat and I enjoyed spending time in there both because of the beautiful wicker furniture, dark antique wood armoirs / closet doors / tables, AND because the A/C was super strong and reliable - as was the WiFi! I watched movies several nights on my iPad without a problem.  - The RESTAURANT: Attached to the Casa is Henshin Sushi where you can get literally the freshest, most delicate tasting nigiri in all of western Mexico (maybe even the whole country?). I did the Omikaze, which is traditional Japanese style 3-5 course dinner and enjoyed every second, and every bite. The chef and his brother run a beautiful kitchen and serve you each nigiri with pride. I would suggest sitting at the bar with them because they're so friendly and you can learn so much about sushi (and Mexico!).   Need I say more! Don't look further in Sayulita (as I did before I found Casa Niwalli) and just stay here - you won't regret it! It's a pure gem!",50,1023
…,30,1023
"We stayed 4 days at casa Nawalii, we have been coming to Sayulita for years and it was one of our best experiences. The new owner and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast was so delicious, you could feel the love the chef put into each plate. We also ate at the attached sushi restaurant and had the tasting menu. Also, incredible.  We can't wait to come back! We will be staying here again and again.",50,1023
"My husband and I loved the property and were very excited when we checked in. The pool area is beautiful and the location is on the north side of town, which we thought would be nice and quiet.  One issue was that the bathroom was flooded the whole time we were there due to the shower being level with the rest of the floor. It was a design issue--the shower curtain didn't go all the way to the floor, and the shower head was not adjustable, so we just had to deal with a soaking wet bathroom the whole time.   Second, there was a big beautiful tree on the property that was filled with birds. This was lovely and provided shade during the day, but around 4-7AM every day the birds would go crazy with their chirping. It sounded like we were in an aviary. Our room didn't have a lot of",50,1023
" noise insulation, so we both had a very hard time sleeping. Luckily I had noise canceling headphones that I could put on at 4AM, but my husband did not. We got home from our trip absolutely exhausted, which is not what we were hoping for after a vacation. I know this is out of the owners control, but I imagine they could put some measures into place to detract the birds from the tree.   We both agreed we wouldn't stay there again. It wasn't a comfortable, relaxing experience like we would expect for the price.",50,1023
…,20,1023
"I was tipped onto this place by somebody “in the know” about Sayulita. I get why. This little hotel only has six or seven rooms, but somehow has the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to, about the size of a two-car garage, including the patio. The hotel is absolutely immaculate, and the (new) owner is a retired high-end hotel manager who makes this place a showpiece of a boutique hotel. Sayulita is a bustling little surf town, somewhat a victim of its own success (good luck finding a parking place) but Nawalli was its own quiet world. It wasn’t cheap for two nights, but a good value, considering. Probably a good idea to book ahead, especially in season. This is the kind of place you say “somehow I will be back.”",50,1023
"We had stayed at Casa Nawalli three years ago and fell in-love with the property and the amazing staff. Recently, we found out they reopened with new ownership and decided to revisit. Luckily the new owner has made minor but welcome upgrades to the property and experience while keeping the same staff. It is still the quiet, serene, and welcoming space as before.   New Upgrades -The pool is now salt water and has a beautiful tiled bottom.  -Breakfast and snacks were made-to-order by a fantastic on-site Chef.  -The new owner took us for a tour around the city in his ATV.  -There is a new fire/water display to enjoy in the central garden.  -Turn down service   It was another perfect stay this time and it's wonderful that the property is still going after the family decided to sell",50,1023
" it.   TL;DR: It's clean, fairly priced, centrally located, and serene. The staff makes you feel like a family member (in a good way). It has a pool, breakfast/snacks, A/C, internet (had a video call in the main house), and anything we needed. If you're going to Sayulita, and not a spring breaker, stay here.",50,1023
"Cult Wild Hostel has super chill staff. They had a party table out front and the front desk dude played awesome tunes until 10 pm at night. The music and hostel turns off all noise at 10 pm. The beds were super comfy. They had washroom and showers upstairs. Only hiccup was a lots of the loos were out of toilet paper. So you had to be careful which stall you chose. Otherwise great staff. Great location. Walking distance to everywhere..beach, restaurants, pubs. I highly recommend this hostel!",50,1024
quiet rooms and air conditioned! no noise after 10 pm..the hostel was pretty quiet..no curtains on the beds so you have to put up your sheet as a curtain..beds are super comfy..had a great sleep. awesome staff! fried eggs for breakfast in the upstairs kitchen. check the washrooms before you go in..many ran out of toilet paper. i would still stay here again! thank you!,50,1024
"This place is awesome! The beds & linens are ridiculously comfortable. Like, seriously. Better than my own at home. Everyone I met staying there was super nice & the staff is helpful too. It’s walking distance to everything and far enough from downtown so you can get some rest, if that’s what you prefer. Quiet hours are respected, which as a weary traveler I appreciated. Secure, clean, beautiful art. Will be back!",50,1024
"My first night I managed to get 14 hours of well-needed sleep. The bunk room is very dark and quiet hours are respected late into the morning. The hostel is located in a quieter part of town just 5 minutes walking distance from the beach and downtown area. While guests mainly keep to themselves, there are group activities scheduled everyday to get out and experience Sayulita life. I was quite satisfied with the kitchen and facilities and for the price you really can’t beat it! I would stay again without a doubt and would recommend it to anyone traveling through or simply taking a short vacation such as myself!",50,1024
"I really enjoyed my stay here, what was supposed to be a 2 night stay turned into a week! Good activities, nice kitchen, great volunteers, chill atmosphere. Loved the no noise after 10pm rule, made for some of the best sleeps I've had in hostels so far! The showers are really not great though, and the drinking water didn't feel totally trustworthy.",50,1024
"Beware! Once you check in, it'll be hard to leave. The people and the vibes are best around. Truly a hidden lotus land you can get lost in. I already have my next stay booked. Everyone was so friendly, and even though I was travelling solo - felt like I've known everyone forever",50,1024
"You do not fully understand the good vibes until you live in it, brothers from all over the world motivating each other Incredible location and price per night, group activities make this an unmissable stopover Cleanliness and security, I will try to return when going through this beautiful corner of the Pacific",50,1024
Cult has been a really enjoyable hostel. I’m still here one week later and planning to stay for another two. The people are great and there’s a good vibe.its comfortable and the nights are cool now to sleep,50,1024
"Cult Backpacker hostel has such a lovely vibe, lovely people (you will definitely make some cool friends there), and the best is is that it is soo cheap: 100 Mexican pesos per night. I do think that having small vans for every bed would be an amazing and necessary addition to the hostel because it if often very warm during the night.",50,1024
"This is an amazing hostel! Has a great mixture of fun, chill vibes but also being respectful of their neighbours and making sure everyone is safe is clearly high on their priority list, which as a solo, female traveler I think is very important! Sam, the guy who runs the place, was very welcoming the second we walked into the door (literally into it, our bag was stuck haha)! His contagious smile, willingness to answer questions and approachability makes this hostel what it is. The location of the hostel is really great too, close to the plaza but not so close that it’s loud! Close to the beach, close to shops, close to the bus stop but the most important aspect of hostels for me as a solo traveler is the easy, comfortable approach to meeting people here. They’ve got events going",50,1024
I found david to be exceedingly helpful  I had issues with my travel and they couldnt have been more accommodating   I would not have any issues staying there  I do not have other details but this needs 200 characters,50,1025
"Stayed for 9 weeks very recently and loved the rooftop pool and views, short walk to town for dining and shopping and having stayed downtown in the past it was nice and quiet at night!  Kitchenette area set up for ample cooking, also!  Located on the North side, that part of the beach is a tad quieter which is nice and there are also rests. Closeby, if don’t want to cross the bridge into the busy downtown square.  David & Jeannette are great hosts and very helpful, with whatever you might need.  I look forward to staying again!",50,1025
"Stayed at Villa Los Corales for a month Our room was clean and  all the amenities needed were included. The hosts, David and Jeanette were wonderful hosts. The roof top patio and pool provided a  great view of the town and ocean. There were lots of restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed ourselves and it was sad to leave the hot sunny weather. This location was the perfect place to spend our vacation.",50,1025
"We absolutely loved our stay at Villa Los Corrales. The location is perfect, the hosts were attentive and lovely, the view from the rooftop is spectacular, and the room itself was spacious, clean, and the kitchen amenities were great.   Would come back 100%!",50,1025
"Rooftop patio with an infinity pool has spectacular views.  Easy downhill to the quieter north beach or into town with a short steep hill to climb on the return.  Definitely worth it for the view and quiet (other than roostersand dogs).    Hosts are brilliant, especially helpful. Decor is new but charming. Amenities are as advertised, with drinking water supplied, and everything is spotless - with full room cleaning every 3 days.  Delightful.",50,1025
"We had a wonderful week staying at Villa Los Corales.  Our room was spacious with a great view into the hillside neighborhood.  The rooftop pool was spectacular for sunsets and a quiet, peaceful retreat.  The location was perfect, easy walk downhill to the town or beach.    Like most places in Mexican towns, the roosters can be noisy early in the morning.  Bring earplugs, and I didn’t hear them at all.    David and Jeannette were very sweet and accommodating.  We would definitely return here happily.  ",50,1025
We had such a lovely studio apartment. Every detail was considered. The Villa was very clean and all the staff was friendly. The rooftop pool and lounge area was so beautiful. The sunsets and views were amazing. It's a great spot to do yoga as well. The hosts David and Jeanette were wonderful and so helpful. We extended our stay because it was such a special place. The location is perfect. It's in walking distance to all the great places Sayulita has to offer but out of the noise of the town.,50,1025
"I love Los Corales. My husband and I have been going for years now. It is very close to town and the beach. The swimming pool is  GREAT!! They are friendly and give you your privacy, would recommend anyone to stay here.",50,1025
"David and his wife Jeannette were great hosts! We got to the hotel a few hours after check-in and David was waiting for us. He gave us a tour of the place and showed us to our room. The room was plenty big for four people and was very clean. The hotel is also very conveniently located where you can get to the city center quickly, but are not too close where you get any disturbances. The hotel has an incredible rooftop that over looks the city. We spent an afternoon there relaxing and enjoying the pool. I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Sayulita.",50,1025
"My wife and I stayed in the wonderful Palma suite for six days while we attended a destination wedding. We instantly felt very welcome and at home with the simple and classy room with a great view overlooking the town  and south side of the bay. As mentioned, they are great hosts and take pride in providing a great property above and away from the noisy downtown.  The small rooftop area with infinity pool was perfect to get sun or cool off and enjoy the views (i actually preffered hanging out here more than the beach) We made good use of the kitchenette for breakfast and coffee, since we are frugal like that. I brought a bag of Pete's coffee from home and was happy to have a regular coffee maker with filters for my daily fix.  The only negatives for me were the climb up the hill",50,1025
"The vibe of Aurinko is colorful, clean and relaxed.  Located right next to the center, you're not more than a few steps from anything.  I spent a lot of time just watching the iguanas sun themselves in a tree across the way from our kitchen / living room balcony.",50,1026
"Very cute little quaint hotel with an outdoor kitchen, air conditioned room, private bathroom and close to the city center. The decor was adorable- beautiful plants and tons of color and art all around! There is a pool on the grounds but i never saw anyone use it. They have books available to grab and read too! We enjoyed our time here so much we extended our stay one additional day!",50,1026
"Aurinko is a very special place, I liked the color and decoration of the place, the art on the walls, the open space kitchen. The proximity to all the good things in Sayulita (Beach, Plaza, Restaurants), the friendliness of the staff. The only thing I didn't enjoy was leaving.",50,1026
"Beautiful, clean, secure small boutique hotel.. Close to the beach and centro Salulita. Wonderful place to stay for a night or five. Open air front room, kitchen, table, fridge and stove. Supplied with dishes, coffee pot, pans and silverware. Highly recommended from Utah Couple. Love, love, love.",50,1026
"Aurinko Bungalows was a great place to stay.  Steps from the beach and the city center, it's got everything you need for a great stay.  The rooms are clean and well-appointed.  Each room has an outdoor area with a little kitchen and sitting area.  There are fans for the outside to help keep mosquitos away.    Everyone working here is so kind!  I was a solo traveler and they all checked in on me from time to time to make sure I was doing okay.  I managed to arrive right before the presidential election and no one was allowed to serve or sell alcohol.  It was hot and I really wanted a beer.  And Carmen found one from somewhere and brought it to me.    Bring your own shampoo and condition and maybe your own beach towel.  I'm already planning my next trip.",50,1026
"Aurinko is Swiss Family Robinson meets Romancing the Stone.  From the time you ring the bell you are transformed into a Paradise...on a fun, busy, cobblestone street near the beach.  We absolutely loved it.  It was spotlessly clean and the people working there felt like family.  One of the women that lives on site has a darling dog named Charlie who would come and visit us much to her shagrin.  We loved it!  If I had to have a negative I think the pool could use more comfy furniture.  The pool is small but that was OK!  But patio furniture reflecting the rest of the amazing property would of been nice.  But our room was spectacular.  So authentic.  We didn't use our kitchen except for coffee but everything you'd need to cook was there.  We are going back as soon as we can!",50,1026
"We were very pleased with the proximity to the heart of the action of Sayulita. Aurinko Bungalows is super close to the beach, restaurants and markets. This quanit place is really clean, fresh, and cozy and felt secure. There is a small pool. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Each unit has a covered open air kitchen with fridge, stove, and couches, and each unit has a locked bedroom/bathroom.  There are rooms on three levels, so luggage needs to be dragged up the stairs if on the upper levels. The noise level wasn't as bad as we thought it would be, except for the birds! This place was a diamond in the rough!",50,1026
"The location of this place was just perfect: it is next to small supermarket, several restaurants, and the beach is few blocks (100 meters or so) away. There a yoga studio within the premises. Good lessons, but having an advance booking for guests would be great.  Rooms are very clean and ac was good as well. Our room was at the first floor, so few people were passing by our room. But the hotel is pretty small, so this did not really bother us. We had a full-size fridge at the room as well. So even the hotel did not serve breakfast, buying yoghurts and fruits next door was an easy choice.  We stayed for three nigths that was a good time for us in Sayulita.",50,1026
"Let me preface this by saying that i think it really depends on the traveler as to how you will feel about this location. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: Very centrally located. Tienda in less than a minute, beach in two, town square in one, restaurant in one. You just couldn't be better located for seeing the town. The staff is wonderful and friendly. The place is cute and they have nice little kitchens. The building is secure. There are cool hammocks to sit in for that great vacation feel. If you like yoga that is available on-site. The air-conditioning and fans are more than enough to keep the temperature just right. Water pressure is good. You can watch iguanas in the trees. The water is filtered. The ""living space"" is outdoors and spacious. Our unit was upstairs so we",30,1026
" got a view (some good and some bad). The fridge is clean and cold. There are really great bed reading lights (wish the bed was more comfy). We could see the fireworks on the beach from our living space. But not the actual beach.  Cons: The beds are hard and the linens, while clean I am sure, are functional but not in any way nice. Same with the towels. Same with the furniture in the living space. The nightlife in town is loud and lively until 3 AM every night. This did not bother me as I tend to sleep hard. I only noticed because the beds were so hard I woke up frequently to switch position due to pain. Then I would hear the noise but fall back asleep. The fan and air conditioning help hide that noise and it truly didn't bother me however it bothered another person in our party. There is a pool but it is VERY small and the deck chairs are not comfy. It is not an inviting space. If you are a chill by the pool person, this is NOT the place for you. There are salamanders everywhere but they didn't bother me either. I think I picked up some of their tiny poops off the kitchen counter and bathroom counter. I just wiped the counters down with a soapy paper towel and it didn't bother me. The question is, would it bother you? You overlook a yard and space under construction and it's very messy. There is an occasional whiff of Sayulita's sewage issue but I think that is everywhere.   I think I've reached an age where night life is not important but comfort is, so that's why this location is not a good fit for me. However, if you want a very centrally located, safe, clean, kind, decently appointed place for a reasonable price then this IS the place for you. Traveler know thyself.",40,1026
"Sayulita is not the quiet surfing town it once was. Anjali Casa Dinina is a serene, very well laid out boutique hotel just a couple minute walk from the centre of everything in Sayulita. The breakfast is small, healthy and self serve, the yoga classes are fantastic, they have all the things you need for the beach to take with you if you want. The grounds and rooms are impeccably cared for and tastefully decorated. Rafael is a fantastic communicator. I couldn’t recommend this place more!",50,1027
"Charming and peaceful boutique hotel located on a hill overlooking the ocean and just above the main part of town. It’s a 5 minute walk from the hustle and bustle, but it has the feel of a quiet, secluded getaway from all the action. It was the perfect home base to explore all that Sayulita and the region has to offer. The hotel offered surf and stand up paddle boards, beach chairs and towels to rent for free. Rafael couldn’t have been more personable and was available all day to make recommendations on things to do and places to eat, and to arrange any activities. Would not hesitate to stay here again.",50,1027
"The Property was honestly so great! the location was just a stone throw away from the main town, restaurants and markets, so this meant a great nights sleep away from the Loud music that the square may bring.   breakfast was also a bonus! fresh fruit and nuts in the morning, juice and tea and coffee.   The pool was a great temperature for swimming and came with an ever better view!    I loved the yoga classes available everyday, which I attended everyday, the yoga instructor was great and made the classes very enjoyable and challenging.   the cleanliness was so refreshing after a long day at the beach, clean towels and the bedding was also very soft and comfortable.  I had 5 of my best nights sleep here! and couldn’t recommend this place enough!   lastly the host, Rafael was so",50,1027
 unbelievably accommodating he went above and beyond to make our stay 10/10. I would truly like to thank him for being so great!   10/10 stay! loved it!,50,1027

"Casa Anjali is a welcome oasis in Sayulita with clean, modern well-appointed rooms, beautiful ocean views, stunning yoga studio, and heated saltwater pool. The staff was attentive, friendly, and Rafael the manager spoke English and was a wonderful resource. I highly recommend Casa Anjali especially if you are looking for a quaint boutique hotel for a family reunion or meditation/yoga retreat.   And, another huge thanks to Vanessa who is super kind and her hard-working husband, Miguel. The staff really made it feel like home.   Tips:  - we enjoyed our dinner at Don Pedro's. book ahead for a table on the beach. - we had a horrible dinner at Xochi. the street im front of the restaurant is great for photos though. - wear comfortable shoes to walk up and down the cobblestone streets",50,1027
" or pay a small fee for a ride in their golf cart.   - bring pesos. we had a hard time finding ATMs that worked. - beware of swimming in the beach at Sayulita. didn't seem that clean. - if you want a little more peace and quiet, walk to the north end of Sayulita Beach or take trips towards Punta de Mita. Ask Rafael, he'll guide you.",50,1027
…,50,1027
"Where do I even begin about Anjali Casa Davina?  This place was absolute paradise after staying right in the heart of Sayulita for a few nights before.  It was the perfect escape from the the noise and craziness, yet only a 5 minute walk back into it.  If you are seeking a place to party, this hotel is not for you.  Anjali is a quiet, adults-only sanctuary that truly allows you to relax in Sayulita.  Breathtaking views, an incredible pool, stunning greenery and vegetation, the friendliest staff... I could go on forever about how beautiful and relaxing this hotel it.  The rooms are clean, the property is stunning and they provide everything you need (towels, beach umbrellas, surfboards, ice chests) free of charge.  I cannot picture a better place to stay for couples in Sayulita. ",50,1027

"Aweful, avoid this place unless you are happy to stay in a filthy hostel, super gross, the bathroom that you share with everyone is gross, somebody had bed bugs in their bed which I am not surprised about. I enquired about activities 2 weeks before my arrival to make sure I would not miss out on surf and yoga, I'm still waiting for the yoga the staff was so clueless and useless appart from Gaby and Alan. Enquired more in the dedicated group but no one bothered replying. I had to ask them to remove a chewing gum stuck on my bed side table that clearly no one noticed because th3 room was not clean. The cupboard to keep my stuff was gross as well with leftover package from previous person so I assume no one cleaned in there either. Extremely noisy at night. Aweful I went somewhere",10,1028

"My friend and I spent about 10 days in La Redonda, it’s been such an amazing time and the volunteers in particular made our stay amazing! Except this the cleaning wasn’t the best it could be improved. Unfortunately, we found bed bugs in our room almost every person reported bugs in their bed. We told to managers and we were told we could not move room cus the hostel was full, the only thing to do was to clean our clothes and change bed’s sheets, which wouldn’t have solved the problem as bed bugs stay. Unfortunately we had to book another accommodation because we refused to stay with bed bugs. They refunded us which we appreciated but wanted to make others travelers aware of this issue.",20,1028
"Good place, cheap, nice beds, very close to beach, restaurants, bars and other good stuffs, people who works in la Redonda are so cool and all the visitors too, i loved the hostel AND i'll be back soon. Thanks a lot.",50,1028
Overall the hostel is pretty and charming and has a good vibe. It is well placed downtown close to all the shops and restaurants (although keep in mind that there is a lot of noise downtown at night). Were I was disappointed was the quality of the staff.  They couldn't give me basic information about the town. For example ; they could tell me where were to have a good breakfast or the best place to rent a surf board. They didn't had any activities plan except for partying at night. Also my bed sheets were stained and looked dirty and my fan wasn't working.  So I would recommend staying there unless you are really into a party vibe and already know the town.,30,1028
"I have been to a hostel once before. But this place is another thing. It is amazing, this hostel was another level of experience. Great place, great people, amazing staff. Next to the beach and to the downtown. 110% recommended.",50,1028
"standard hostal with typical leisure activities: trips, parties, hospitality, kitchen access, shared bathroom.  The location is pretty good close to the beach and main restaurants. However, is a really small town, so eveything is quite close in a walking distance.  It is informed that noise is acceptable until midnight, but actually it is 2am or at least during the days that I stayed there. So if you look for a quiter place, it´s not the right place for you.",50,1028
"What an amazing place! All the volunteers who work there are so lovely, kind, helpful and welcoming. I completely agree with their insta (@laredondahostel) - BEST VIBES in Sayulita for sure. I stayed for just under two weeks, in two different rooms as I had two different bookings. One room was an 8 person, the other for 4 people and both were fab, clean, tidy and the beds were super comfortable.   It's such a beautiful and sociable place, and there's always people around to talk to, but equally if you want some time to yourself there's hammocks in the corner where you can just chill and relax.   The volunteers organised social activities most evenings - 'Family dinner' pizza night, sunset/beach fire at Carricitas, trivia night, and just dance (a safe space to throw some serious",50,1028
" shapes) - all these activities are optional, there's no pressure to join in but everyone is so lovely that you just don't wanna miss out on all the cool things they plan each night.   There's also yoga most early evenings, and the chance to go on surf trips to la lancha for the day, open to anyone and everyone of all abilities with the opportunity to have lessons for those looking to get better at shredding the gnar ;)   The location of the hostel is perfect if you want get around by foot - less than two mins to Oxxo, or other local mini supers, surrounded by lovely boutique stores and cute cafes/restaurants. It's a 30 minute walk to Carricitas (sunset beach), 40 minutes to Malpaso (opposite direction to Carricitas, an absolutely enormous sandy beach with nearly no-one in sight), 15 mins from the bus station and apparently only a 2hr hike to San Pancho, although unfortunately I didn't have time to do that this time round.   Even whilst writing this review I'm in the process of booking again this month, as two weeks was just not enough.  If you're pushed for time I'd say stay at least for a week - any less and you'll wish you listened to this review because after only a couple of nights you won't want to leave.   I cannot recommend this place enough, and for sure it's the reason I had such a wonderful time I'm Sayulita.    Thank you thank you thank you ",50,1028
"Perfect location - a bit off the beaten track - quiet, clean, and welcoming. The desk staff (Frank, Lorenzo, Adriana) were most helpful and always professional. The ladies making breakfast every day (Yesenia, Esperanza, Elena) were sweet and kind.

Open air 3 levels, lots of greenery, 2 pools, 2 yoga shalas, beautiful lighting , gorgeous local art.  The rooms are huge, bright, clean with balconies, shampoo conditioner, body wash and lotion.  The beds are extremely comfortable.  There are water jugs in some rooms and several in the hallways.  All rooms have a mini fridge and a safe.  The yoga classes are lead by a few fantastic instructors.  The classes vary from hatha to ashtanga.  There are passes available to make it even more affordable.  But a daily drop in if you are staying at the hotel is 100 pesos about $6. The 5 class pass is 400 pesos which is $24!! Open air yoga with the sounds",50,1029

There’s coffee tea fresh squeezed juices fresh fruit yogurt granola and a hot buffet( which they serve to you due to Covid) eggs Mexican style, beans, chillaquilas, sometimes spinach or zucchini in pesto, fresh bread, tortillas, homemade salsas.  I looked so forward to this after my morning yoga. The hotel is well maintained and very clean.  It is locked at night accessible with your key.

Coming from a cold climate we looked forward to the pools but the water was too cold.  1 out of 4 of us jumped in but quickly got out.  Other guests commented on the temperature and were very disappointed too that they couldn't swim. We had to buy our own lighter to light the cooktop and some of the dishes were dirty.  Overall it was a pleasant place to stay, just disappointing to go to Mexico and not be able to swim without freezing.",50,1029
"Minimalist hotel. No hot water in the pool, no phone, no TV, bad wifi.  Excellent massage, good breakfast. This was an expensive hotel taking in account the services you get.  We saw some crockroaches @ to he washroom. Poor face mask enforcement was noticed.                             ",30,1029

"We stayed here in February and again in April. The staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfasts are very nice.  The kitchen was missing a few things (they had to run to the store to buy a lighter so we could fix dinner).  We were a little concerned about the black spots on walls (mold?) but overall the room was nice. The pools were too cold to get into so that was a bit of a disappointment. The day we left, they said our bags would be safe at the front desk while we went for lunch. Unfortunately my jewlery bag was missing out of my carryon along with a couple beauty products. As a sidenote, we had to leave a couple days early and were unable to receive a credit -  one of the reasons we returned in April.",50,1029
"We loved our stay at Hotelito Los Sueños. For us, it was perfectly located just north of the hub of activity. So close enough but still quiet at night. The free breakfast was simply amazing. So delicious!! I’m still kicking myself that I didn’t take advantage of a yoga class. I guess I just need to go back! The staff was friendly and helpful. The Hotel was a quick walk to the beach. We found a spot just south with a bar and beach massages. We would give 5 stars if the beds weren’t so firm (but that may be my personal preference of a softer bed).",50,1029
"The 11 days spent were simply wonderful. Well maintained, quiet, personable staff, delicious breakfast served daily. We felt totally relaxed and secure. Excellent value for a clean and convenient hotel close to town",50,1029
Had a room up top which was very comfortable and quiet. Great bed and shower but lacked a fridge which would have been handy. WiFi was virtually non existent in the room but OK on the terrace outside the door. Having said that our stay their was great. Local restaurants were terrific and Isabelle went to a lot of trouble to locate us a handy parking spot for our stay there and Jim was kind enough to help me extricate the car from there when we were going. Thanks guys ,50,1030
"This is my second trip to Sayulita and staying at Casa Campana.  It was absolutely wonderful each time.  We stayed in Guest room #2 each time.  It was beautiful.  We left the doors open a few nights and fell asleep listening to the waves hit the shore.  That is the most soothing sound.  We spent time enjoying the sounds and sights on the beach from the comfy chairs on the verandah.  Since we were so close to town we spent lots of time exploring and enjoying the city.  After exploring we would come back and enjoy the pool and relaxing on the verandah.  I also have to comment on the outside shower.  It was one of my favorite things!!  I just loved it!!  The staff, Tony, Eduardo and housekeepers were very friendly and accommodating.  We would definitely stay here again!!  Thank you",50,1030

"We stayed in Guestroom #2 which is the best. Private patio, open air shower microwave refrigerator and amazing view! With village restaurants just a few blocks away who needs a kitchen.  This home is right across a dirt street from the beach and has beach chairs umbrellas and boogie boards for guest use. We hung at the beach for hours and then came home to our private pool. Yes it was paradise.   We loved Casa Campana and plan to return. Sayulita is a neat beach town with LNG beach and rather gentle surf. Good escape from busy crowded Puerto Vallarta. ",50,1030
"Dave and Joan were incredible hosts who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. They know everything about the area and really set the tone for relaxing into the Sayulita life. The space is very clean, great easy walk into town (5 min) but far enough away on a hill to feel remote and more quiet than in the square. I can't say enough good things about them as hosts and the space you will not regret. (Sorry it took so long to write this review D & J)!",50,1030
"My husband and I stayed in Guest room 2 for a week and were very pleased with our accommodations. The room was large with plenty of storage and a huge outdoor shower. We had two balconies with great views of the beach/ocean. The owners were away during our visit but we were very well taken care of by our host Tony, an exceptional young man. Everything was clean and comfortable, enjoyed our dips in the pool in the afternoons. Everything we needed was within easy walking distance. Overall great experience!",50,1030
"My wife and I are some of the many returning guests to Casa Campana, which alone says something about the property. However, it has been awhile since our last visit and we wondered if it would live up to previous stays. Well, we are pleased to report the place is in fabulous shape and still just as good as it possibly gets in the town of Sayulita.  We booked room #2 once again for it's huge deck overlooking the surf and the privacy it affords being on the other side of the structure, separate from the beautiful pool and additional guest rooms. Having the extra space really allowed us to spread out and relax in the hammock, the super comfortable chairs with brand new cushions or even sitting at the table on the additional ocean-view balcony directly off the bedroom (wifi was",30,1030
" working everywhere). When we headed to the beach, the Casa has all the necessities with beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards for the waves.  While town was packed for the February week we were there, nights were consistently quiet for us. Even when there were events like the annual school fundraiser at Don Pedros restaurant or a big ""collectivo wedding"" ceremony and celebration on the beach, it was fun to watch the activity and the music was over well before midnight. We usually went to bed early and simply put the air conditioner on low which easily blocked out any noise.  The owner Cheryl and her staff are so welcoming and treat us like family. She personally drove us to Punta Mita to go whale watching in a private boat with Captain Javier who navigated us among numerous humpbacks in the bay there. A real treat that should not be missed if they are in season.  In summary, this is a very special place with hands down the best ocean front location on the south end of town with excellent proximity to everything just steps away. The pricing makes it an incomparable value and we definitely will be back again. Book your stay now; you cannot do any better in Sayulita than Casa Campana!",40,1030

"A small hotel, with very clean rooms and reasonable priced. The AC units works great, keeps the room nice and cool. Excellent location, in the middle of town, If you want a nice room, and nothing more, this is the place. Great bathrooms. Did I mentioned clean.",50,1031
We stayed for 3 nights. Very clean. Big comfortable bed. Great roof top view deck. Very loud outside and earplugs and windows closed not too loud inside. Great location. Very sterile enviroment decor but everything is right outside the front door for vibrancy! Great price. The room needs a cup to brush your teeth with. A couple floor mats to wipe your feet. All n all I was surprised for the price it wasn' t full every night! ,40,1031
"Nice and clean, but not enough toilet paper, daily (!) no drinking water Or glass or plastic cups to brush your teeth.  Can use a floor towel in the bathroom so you step in water each time you go in.  Nice over all. ",40,1031
We been there for a week and it was really clean and the staff was very friendly even though we didn't speak spanish. A little bit noisy but it was a long week-end so we guessed it was noisy everywhere in town that week-end. I would stay again at this place for sure,50,1031
"If you want to be close to the beach, this is a great option! Clean and has everything I need!  Cable and wifi included ... plus AC...  Overall a good place to stay close to the Plaza and the nice restaurants and cafes. PS.  clean :)",40,1031
My friend and I were looking for a place last minute to stay in Sayulita one more night. We had previously stayed at an airbnb up the road (which was pretty awful) and so we wanted a place that was more inviting. Erika and Jose were very warm and welcoming and took us in. The rooms have AC and are clean and the location is in the center of it all but still quiet enough when you need to sleep. ,40,1031
"Clean. Fairly new with a modicum of amenities: a/c, ensuite, tv and excellent location. We found this gem when our previous stay didn't pan out. Beach is a block away and in the center of town. Can't beat it for the price. Very happy we found this hotel while looking for an alternative place to stay",40,1031
This hotel is in a great location about a block from the beach. The Rooms are clean and well kept and were cleaned daily. There was no one else staying here so we had the whole building to ourselves. Air conditioning worked well which is very important in summer!,40,1031
"I can say that the town of sayulita is a cool little town that did not disapoint us at all, we have traveled around Mexico and only reviewing my favorites. We are not rich people and travel on a budget and Hotel Eden was really nice right in the center of town. We paid about $50 a night and it was quite comfortable, clean with AC, not much more you need. The staff was nice and we are glad we picked this hotel.",50,1031
We stayed a few nights at Hotel Eden and thought it was nice. It was not the best place but nice. It was very clean and the staff was also very corteous. I loved the town of Sayulita so we spent very little time at the hotel. It was nice,40,1031
The Avela Boutique hotel was a 5 star experience from start to finish. The vibe was consistently beautiful and tranquil. With just an 8 minute walk from Sayulita town it was the perfect distance to get into the buzzy party part with a numerous amount of great bars and restaurants. My partner and I were greeted with the warmest welcome and it did not stop there. All the staff were so friendly and always went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. The hotel itself was sparkling clean and luxurious. We would 100% stay there again!,50,1032
"Quiet location outside the center of Sayulita, the hotel is very simple but clean overall. The pool is the main attraction here, and the two hot tubs draw a crowd day and night. There is a small restaurant on site that provides breakfast and lunch, but it was closed inconsistently throughout our stay with no prior warning. Food was simple but did the job. The rooms were a bit inconsistent, some with tile floors, others with painted concrete, some with two chairs, others with one, etc. They seem to be all the same size so not sure why there was a discrepancy. The hot water in the shower takes some time to arrive but once it does it is consistent. Overall, it's a nice budget friendly stay in a very laid back surf town.",40,1032
"We are locals and stayed at Avela when our power was down. For the price this place is an utter disappointment and you can stay at many other places in Sayulita of better quality for cheaper.  Stay elsewhere if you are able. While the staff/management was kind when inquiries were made about all of the ""broken"" or non-functioning amenities throughout the hotel, the staff had no desire to fix them or remediate the situation.

"Hello to future travelers to Sayulita,  While I was fooled by the number of positive reviews, I believe that these reviews are misleading, and I completely agree with the review of AJ1 (that I had also read prior to booking with Hopper, but foolishly ignored). I honestly thought AJ1 had more of a run in regarding his Expedia booking and the negative interactions colored his entire trip. And with so many other positive reviews, I ignored his foolishly.  However, he is shockingly accurate in his review of this hotel. On the Hopper website, this property is shown as a FIVE STAR hotel compared to other boutique hotels who only rate themselves as a THREE star hotel and they charge like they are a five star hotel ($950 for 7 nights). This alone made me drawn to the property, that and",40,1032
" the photographs of a brand new hotel that is now quite run down. DO NOT BE FOOLED.  I had just come from a stay at the W Punta Mita (an actual 5 star hotel) and this is only marginally better than a basic Airbnb stay and honestly my Sayulita Airbnb stay (Leavetown Sayulita) was a way better value ($500 for 6 nights). I wanted to stay at a luxurious property in Sayulita before I moved to an Airbnb so I could enjoy my extra day off over Memorial Day weekend. Needless to say, this was not luxurious at all.  Instead of rehashing all of these issues again, I am copying and pasting my note to the hotel owner, who initially responded to my email and then went radio silent, and I had to follow-up two times before she responded again, offering me a one night future stay credit. I would not stay at this property ever again even if I were likely to come back to Sayulita so found this an incredibly disingenuous response.  Instead if you want to stay at a boutique hotel with more amenities (as opposed to an Airbnb), I would recommend Don Bonito hotel (Same pricing) or Puerto Saylita hotel. I checked out both of these properties so can attest that that location and the pictures are reflective of the current condition of the property.  The locations of both of these hotels are also infinitely better (and a flat walk, not a walk up a steep hill). The location of Avela is on a hilltop, near the main ""highway"" or road going in and out of town from the coast. The highway is always busy and there are many trucks that pass by just a few hundred feet from the pool. Puerto Sayulita is also along the main road going in and out of town, but he pool is elevated and on the roof of a three story property so it's much quieter. Don Bonito has the best location of all three properties. It's on the North side, the closet property to the beach and where all the locals live.  I also wanted to mention that on the third night of my stay, the key cards didn't work and I was locked out of my room. There isn't someone who is at the front desk 24 hours a day so had to reach out to the security guard who called someone. It took more than 30 minutes to get into my room while I waited for someone to come back to the property to let me in. They said it was because when the month changed from May to June, the key card software is reset and the keys stop working. This would have been nice to know prior to me leaving for the day! I hope this will save someone from being sorely disappointed after visiting this property and paying what they've paid.  My biggest issue is that this place is advertised as a 5 star hotel, when it is a 3 star hotel at best. This is incredibly deceptive in addition to its myriad issues. Lack of hot water in room 10, shower head issues, inconsistent restock of water (you have to ask them even if though they say you get two bottles every day and you usually have to chase them down), inconsistent cleaning services (no service on Day 2 in room 10 and I had to inquire if my room is supposed to be serviced everyday and they finally started knocking on my door to see if I wanted cleaning service), stained patio linens, key card issues, inconsistent cafe hours (people are there in the morning, but don't expect to be able to work from the property and order lunch - have to go into town for that), noisy property, security issues as it is wide open, entire property is poorly maintained. I'll also include pictures so you can see it for yourself.  Hello Nancy,  Hope this email finds you well. I first wanted to say how lovely it is to see you and a team of women running the Avela Boutique Hotel. All the women were very friendly and helpful, and I appreciated the welcoming ambience from the reception to the cleaning staff.  Aside from the staff, my overall experience and stay at Avela left something to be desired. In particular, I was surprised and disappointed by the sound pollution in room 10. Frankly, the noise that is audible in that room is a few decibels lounder than my New York City apartment. This is not a room that should be offered to guests, particularly guests on a vacation.  Unfortunately, I couldn't locate the front desk staff to change rooms on Day 2 so spent a second night in the room. At that point, I was thinking about switching accommodations. Luckly, I was able to switch rooms on Day 3 and the noise was greatly reduced although you could still hear morning conversations of the staff and other guests as noise reverberates through the complex.  There were also several other issues I noted: lack of hot water in room 10, shower head issues, inconsistent restock of water, inconsistent cleaning services (no service on Day 2 in room 10), stained patio linens, etc. All to say that while the stay was palpable, it did not meet the standards of a 5-star hotel or the accompanying nightly rate, as advertised on the booking website.  I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and feedback and recompense for the first two nights of my stay. I am still in Sayulita so if you'd like to discuss live, I am happy to. I wish all the best for you and your beautiful hotel. Thank you for your consideration.  Best regards, Sarah  ",50,1032

"I simply cannot say enough great things about Casa Amistad and Connie. I stay here every time I come to Sayulita, without exception, for several reasons:  1.) Connie is a lovely human and a natural caretaker, making her an excellent host. She's been here for 20 some years and knows everything there is to know about this place, so her recommendations across Sayulita but also broader Mexico for further travels are amazing. 2.) It's super pet-friendly! I travel with my collie/golden mix, Gus, and Casa Amistad was more than welcoming to him. Connie loved him and so did all of the guests filtering in and out. Connie was even kind enough to let me bring in a street dog (after grooming) with a broken leg to heal for a few days. 3.) It's ideal for a long-term stay. The rooms are cozy,",50,1034
" clean, and well taken care of thanks to the lovely Yolanda 4.) It can't be beat for working remotely. Dare I say that Casa Amistad's wifi is the best in the city? It literally never goes out and is strong enough to stream videos and do anything necessary for remote work. Digital nomads, rejoice! 5.) Amenities. There's a local masseuse who comes to the hostal at least once a week. There's espresso every morning, a big kitchen for any cooking needs, several beach umbrellas, a handful of (excellent) surfboards, and boogyboards for guests to use—anything you'd need! 6.) Recycling! Sayultia has a major trash problem, but Connie, along with a friend, have spearheaded a recycling program so you can recycle at the hostal and easily do something to reduce your environmental impact while here.  Again, I really just cannot say enough about how great this place is. It's relaxed, down-to-earth, and no-frills which is exactly the type of people the hostal attracts—you won't find any golf carts here ;)",10,1034

"The owner is very nice, and the property has some great areas to hang out and relax or cook a meal in the shared kitchen. But our room had an empty soap dispenser, and when we asked for some soap, one of the long-term residents (who it appeared substituted for the owner) said some weird stuff to the effect that they don't use or give out soap. The next day before leaving the issue came up again, and made our stay quite awkward. Some of the guests/tenants were also quite loud late into the night, and the room did not have proper curtains, let alone blackout shades, so it was very bright throughout the night. The cats were very friendly.",50,1034
"I recently had to get to Sayulita at the last minute to take a rescue dog to Sayulita Animals so that she could get on a plane to Canada.  On a budget, with a dog, and searching for an affordable place to stay can be hard. Connie replied to my email right away letting me know that it was fine to bring the dog and offered me a great rate. We ended up staying in the dorm room which was empty of people!!  Comfortable enough beds!  Fans great! Clean!  Yes, there are roosters in the house next door and cats but, hey, we are in Mexico!  I ended up getting stuck and having to stay another night which was not a problem. Yaneth and Connie were great in helping me out.  I would recommend this place to anyone - just be prepared for roosters, cats, sweet dogs, and Mexico!  Great location. ",50,1034

"Travelling from Canada to Nuevo Vallarta each winter since 2013 my wife & I have stayed at this hotel on two occasions when overnighting in Sayulita, most recently on Jan.08 & 09.  Previous reviews by other guests adequately describe the rooms, the noise and hotel location within the town.  I will simply confirm that our young, female receptionist was courteous & helpful when we walked in off the street having made no reservation.  She showed us a room that was spotlessly clean with minimum but tasteful decor.  It suited our every need for our two night stay and the ear plugs negated any outside clatter. The rooftop area is simply wonderful and feels like an oasis when one wants a break from the bustling town centre.  We would definitely stay here again.",40,1035
"Cute little hotel one block from the central plaza. This was the second time we stayed here.  There is only about 10 rooms, so it’s difficult to book. Love the ambiance,the rooftop lounge, courtesy tequila, and hammock. The rooms are clean and perfect size. The bathroom is an all-in-one sink, shower, toilet combined (interesting but it works). The air conditioning works well which is important too.  Really cute place for couples, ",40,1035
"We where in Sayulita for the day, and decided to stay. We found this little hotel close to the main plaza and loved it. Because it is so close to the main plaza it can be noisy at night but they provide earplugs and we didn’t even notice the noise. It has a many beautiful details like hearts in the doors, and a gorgeous terrace. The owner must be an artist that makes us Arabian style Decor with a Mexican flair. The room we chose didn’t have AC, but it was cool enough with the fan.  Very affordably priced!! Will definitely plan on returning in the future.",50,1035
"We stayed three nights and absolutely loved the room.   We were in room 1, which is the heart room.  A magical walkway and a comfortable bed.  The bathroom has a palapa roof which ads to the charm.   There is a noise issue on weekends from the surrounding bars, but just stay up with the party people and it’s not an issue.",40,1035
"Stayed one night to sneak in some surfing before returning to USA.  While Sayulita is a bit too ""done"" for my taste, Hafa was a perfect touchdown between surf sessions.  They include a mini fridge, helpful for leftovers from huge Mexican meals.",50,1035
"I just got back from my birthday trip to Sayulita, where I stayed at the Hotel Hafa. The people couldn't be nicer, and the decor couldn't be more charming. It IS located right off of the town plaza, so noise is to be expected, but you're right in the heart of things, and the beach is only a block away. Reception staff was super helpful with tips (Playa de los Muertos!) and helped me to book an adventure to the Hidden Beach in the Marietas Islands, which is now super limited. My room was a cool oasis when I would return from the boiling hot beach. A BIG lizard hung out in my room almost every day, so I had to get used to that (and it jumping out at me from under towels and stuff, causing daily screams - sorry!) until I finally chased it out and up the steps one day. There was",40,1035
" always someone up on the roof hanging out, so I didn't really get to use that space - and didn't see any comp tequila, but it was the off season, so ? The bar wasn't open when I was there that I saw, so will have to return for the ""best margarita in town"". The attached boutique has beautiful souvenirs, and there are great restaurants in every direction. Café El Espresso on the corner was my morning hub for coffee and food fuel. Everyone I show my photos to are jealous and gasp at how pretty Hotel Hafa is. I'm daydreaming about it right now .... GO!",40,1035

"We walked in off the street, no reservation. The hotel has all kinds of funky architectural details that make it a unique place to spend time - we had a thatched roof in part of our room, there are stairs made from beach stones, a whitewashed parapet with divans to lounge on, a nice balcony, and inner courtyard.",50,1035

"A fantastic month long stay in a 2 bedroom main floor condo at the Arrecife.  The villa had everything the 4 of us needed, including a basic kitchen and living area, bath and beach towels enough for four, air conditioning in each bedroom and daily cleaning services.  The villa had a queen in the master, a double in the second bedroom and also had a fold down couch which would be the size of a double.  The villas are well situated with a short 5-6 minute walk to the plaza and an additional 2 minute walk to the beach.  The pool was great on those days that we just wanted to lounge around and were often joined by Tada and Bento the resident dogs who were so amazing and just loved some mid-day rubs (I’ll miss them both)   I booked this through AirBnB and Karina was very responsive",40,1038
"Estuvimos una sola noche, pero fue suficiente para disfrutar de un buen descanso, las camas son cómodas, la habitación limpia y espaciosa, la habitación cuenta con un buen wifi, cafetera y tazas por si quieres prepararte café, además un frigo. La atención de la Sra y su hija (dueñas del hotel) es muy amable, atentas en cualquier momento y te asesoran sobre lo que necesites saber. El hotel está cerca de la plaza caminando. El único inconveniente que le encontré fue que el ruido de los autos que pasan por la calle se escuchan en la habitación por ser esta empedrada, aunque a cierta hora ya no pasan tantos vehículos. Sin duda volvería a hospedarme",40,1039

Aparte, te dejan bolsita de café que podrás hacerte en la cafetera que hay en la habitación (buenísimo) y a parte tienes nevera y TV de plasma de 50”.

"The casitas are nice, great view from Rm#1. However, lots of steep stairs. If you want to stay at the top, best to condition a month in advance. I would've given the place a 4 rating but I like my sleep. There are fishing boats directly in front of the property that get pushed off the sand beach out to the ocean by dilapidated trucks in need of muffler repair. This ""launching"" of boats can occur as early as 4:30 a.m. and persists as long as people are chartering boats. Aside from loud mufflers, they are spinning tires in the sand and revving motors. Then at night, a couple beach bars play VERY loud music with thumping base until 1-2 A.M. This isn't the hotels fault but I wish we'd known before we booked.

We had a couple minor maintenance issues pop up while we were there, taken care of promptly by the on-site staff (daytime).

The beach in front is OK, this is where the fishing boats are along with the smaller surf break for beginners. Very easy to walk up and talk to the boat captains and arrange a fishing trip out for the day. We were quite content to spend our beach time 10 or 15 min walk away at one of the ""beach clubs"" on the main section of the beach. The central plaza is an easy 5 or 10 min walk with a bunch of restaurants and bars circling it. If you walk past the plaza on Av.

As it is not a typical hotel, there is no front desk, so you need to call ahead to have the caretaker let you in. This fact was stated in the listing, so we were aware of it. We called them as we were driving from Puerto Vallarta, so we would not have to wait around upon arrival. We let them know when to expect us, and they were there when we arrived.

The location is a bit out  from the main town centre, so it is not as noisy here as it would be in some of the other hotels.

They gave great local tips to maximize my stay and are genuinely interested in making sure you are comfortable and happy.  Great common spaces and atmosphere to meet other travelers as well.

the front desk staff were awfully rude to some friends of mine. i had invited them up to the rooftop but they were stopped on the way up by the front desk staff (bald male). Instead of politely telling them that infact it was exclusively for the use of the guests he belittled them and was extremely rude to them and even lied to them about even having a rooftop because they werent dressed as if they stay here (. So all in all would not reccomend staying here as sayulita has lots more places to stay with a lot more friendly and welcoming people. Not rude and arrogant like this place. DO NOT STAY HERE!,10,1043

Beds and pillows are comfortable. The pool is fabulous as well as the lounge area. There was some construction happening, so I imagine they are making the hotel even better. About a 10 minute walk from the square, but still close. Would stay again!",50,1043

The Hotel was everything anyone needs on a vacation! Place is immaculately clean and a short walk to the main plaza and beach. The owners are super sweet and helpful!

My daughter and I were back pack traveling up and down the central pacific coast in Mexico. We  booked a room  at the Corzaon Sayulita. two months ahead through Booking.om. When we arrived to the Corazon they said they had no room for us and that we had been re-booked.  I never received any e-mail stating I had been rebooked prior to departing on our trip and I have never had that happen before at the last minute. The Manager at the Corazon sent me to another hotel in Sayulita stating I had been rebooked there and the manager there was waiting for me  I went to the other hotel and the manager had no room for me and stated no one had contacted them about a booking for me. I contacted customer service at booking.com and they said that I had been booked at the Corazon for two,10,1046
 months and the Corazon accepted my reservation and told them nothing about rebooking me at another hotel. Bottom line the Corazon overbooked over Christmas and left me and my daughter without anyplace to stay after traveling 240 kilometers to get there before dark. The Corazon caused a nightmare for us and did not care. I would advise everyone to stay away from the Corazon.so that does not happen to you and your family.,10,1046
I’ve always dreamed of horseback riding on a beautiful beach. Juan ( our excellent guide) at Rancho Mi Chaparrita led us through the jungle and out onto a very beautiful beach at sunset. The horses were healthy and well cared for which was important to us. A photographer accompanied us and the photos were well worth the additional charge. Omar gave us a very educational and entertaining tequila tasting after our ride. We highly recommend this experience!,50,1047
"My daughter and I had a terrific time. Giovanni, Andy, Ernesto and crew were all genuinely lovely, helpful, and fun as hell. There was a smidge of physical activity so if you are hoping for a relaxing day out this probably isn’t it, but it wasn’t too much even for a lady of a certain size (who may or may not be me). Even the people in our group who were initially nervous (who may or may not have been me) were grinning by the end. Recommend!",50,1047
We did multiple activities with these guys and they were great! Zipline was awesome with Giovanni and Andy! They were very professional and funny. Felt very safe the whole time. The ATV excursion was amazing also. Ricky lead our group through trails to some unbelievable views and a beautiful secluded beach. Back at the ranch the entire staff was great. They have a lot of fun with the guests and make everyone feel at home. Overall 10/10. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back!!,50,1047
"Goes through jungle and beach during the 1 hour tour, it’s really beautiful! Carlos did a great job teaching me how to ride the horse and control it. I haven’t been on a horse in over 10 years and I was galloping by the end of the tour. Great way to see sayulita.",50,1047
"This is the 2nd time visiting Sayulita and going on adventure with Rancho Mi Chapparita! Both times we had a blast as a family and I highly recommend a visit!   We have a family with young kids 2.5yr, 4yr, 5 yr, and 6yr! We felt very safe while zip lining and 4 wheeling. They were extremely attentive to our concerns and made us feel safe at all times! Very friendly, safe, easy access from Sayulita, great people that have a great time! After finishing the kids swam in the pool while the adults relaxed and chilled with a couple cold ones!   Highly Recommended!   Jeremy",50,1047
"We booked our stay 4 days before our arrival and there weren’t many options left in Sayulita. Sayulita Suites was one of two properties available and the price was perfect. We were a little scared but we went for it.   It was great! We took a Taxi in from PVR by walking across the bridge from the airport and paid 700 pesos (cheaper than taking the ones inside the airport).   When we arrived at Sayulita Suites our room was ready and the manager greeted us with a quick tour and some space to decompress.   The room had its own bathroom, large bed and full kitchen. Everything was clean and comfortable during our stay. Our key opened a front gate which made it feel safe. The rustic doors to our room were beautiful and give the place a really cool character.   The location is about",50,1048
" 5-10 minute walk from the city center which we thought would be terrible the first time we walked but after being there for for 6 days we realized the walk is really nice and it was great to be away from the bars and restaurants at night. There were people walking to and from downtown at all hours of the day so it felt safe even though the lighting along some of the side streets was poor.   There was a lot of noise from roosters, the neighbors and loudspeakers driving by selling stuff. I can sleep through anything but I know some people are really sensitive to that. However, I think no matter where you stay in Sayulita there will be noise.   Overall, we had a great stay and would come back. Thank you to Nico and the rest of the staff for making our first stay in Sayulita special.",50,1048

"I have spent 2 months in Sayulita Suites. at the beginning i didn't know that I would stay so long, but this house contributed a lot in my decision to stay longer. It's a beautiful place at 5 minutes of walk from la plaza which is the center of Sayulita, and as everybody say, it's better not to stay in the center if you want to sleep at night. It's also a peaceful place which allows you to disconnect with the marvelous and crazy atmosphere of Sayulita. Nixs, the manager of the place is a guy with a great and rare kindness. He will help you if you have any questions about the life in Sayulita. For the rest it's your trip and always an unpredictable adventure, but as you can note in my review, i have loved that place!!! Thank you Nixs and Lynn!",50,1048
"Great location away from the noise but close to everything. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The best part of Sayulita Suites, though, is getting to know Lyn. She took us to the botanical gardens and told us about all her favorite restaurants. I asked, ""Can I say in the review that you taught me to play MahJong?"" She said, ""Sure. I'll teach them all to play Mah Jongg.""",50,1048
"This is our fourth stay with Lyn and each time is more enjoyable. The rooms are perfect, everything you need is there including a blender for pina coladas (which we then take to the rooftop patio for the hillside views in the late afternoon sun).  Lyn very kindly offered to drive us out to a beautiful trail and we hiked back to town for a swim and cervecas. The neighbourhood is an oasis away from the busier, more touristy parts of town. We hope to be back soon, thanks Lyn for your hospitality!",40,1048
We were lucky enough to spend several nights a Sayulita Suites recently. Lyn set us up in the upper room for what was supposed to be only one night but was able to extend it to three. It is a large open format floor plan with two sides of the room completely open to the environment. We absolutely loved the room. It is airy and the view is amazing. Has a large kitchen area with a bar and stools for eating or drinking. It is attached to one of the communal open patios on the rooftop of the building. The only downside is that there are rooster farms near the property and the cock-a-doodling starts early. This is easily remedied with a set of earplugs.   After a few nights we were moved down to the ground floor into another nice room. It had a seperate bedroom and bathroom and nice,50,1048
" kitchen and dining area. Very clean and modern appliances if you are inclined to save a few bucks and cook at home.  The property itself is pretty much near everything while being far enough away that you don't have to deal with the downtown party noises on the weekends. We walked to nearly every part of town and visited most parts of the beach easily. There are beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards and plenty more beach items available to borrow if needed too!  Lyn was a great host and one day took us to the market outside of Sayulita. She made plenty of detours to show us surrounding areas. She has a few little well behaved dogs and some friendly cats who lounge around the property in the noon sun. We were also able to hitch a ride with her back to the airport in PV.   We would definitely stay at SS again.",40,1048
…,50,1048
"Great location  ten minutes from the beach, without the busyness of the streets by the beach.  This was our second year.  We stay for the month of january.  Lynn the owner took us to some beautiful areas around sayulita and the bus depot is 5 minutes away so we did some trips on our own too.  Our suite was the sunflower suite, there was a stove and fridge with the basic utensils to cook your own meals or again it is ten minutes to a variety of dining and stores.  I would reccomend sayulita suites to everyone.",40,1048
Sorry to say but I didn’t find the accommodations up to par for its price point. I stayed in the open air Palapa room. I found it to be rather dirty. Cushions were stained on the furniture. Refrigerator was dirty. The floor needed repainted.  The courtyard that seemed like a lovely spot to hang out from the pictures was being renovated. All chairs and benches were being painted and there was no where to sit. There was no mention of the courtyard being closed when booking.  It was also not swept the 3 days we were there.  I don’t believe the restaurant was even open. I never saw anyone cooking. The kitchen dishes and cookware were sitting outside in the courtyard. The guttering on the rooms roof was very dirty. As well as the roof the room looked out on.   Be prepared if you book,20,1049
" this room that with it being open aired and facing the courtyard there is little privacy. You can hear everyone and they can hear you.  You will also hear very loud music from the night clubs nearby.   Plus side was that it was close to the beach, restaurants and shops.  Unfortunately I wouldn’t stay here again. I saw much better options for the same price.  The place has a lot of potential. Hope they can get to a higher level.",50,1049
…,50,1049
"The hotel is exactly as it states.  A little funky, which we loved, it's clean, everyone was great.  There was some construction next door, we really didn't hear it, but the owner came and apologized to us for the daytime noise.  This is a great place to stay if you want to party in town.  It is loud at night, but it's an experience that we really enjoyed. ",50,1049
"Our family stayed at La Morada for 10 days in January and had a fabulous trip. The staff were accommodating, helped us with our infant, went out of their way to give us advice. The facilities were clean, and as pictured. The hosts also generously took us to a secluded beach near their jungle home one day. We felt like part of the Morada family!",50,1049
"Had dinner at La Morada with their ""guest"" Japanese chef who was working in Sayulita only for a short period of time.  My girlfriend and I had tempura appetizers and miso soup both of which were excellent.  He offered 3 different kinds of tempura and miso to choose from and we tried the veggie tempura and miso. For the main course we had chicken teriyaki and red snapper filet with a chutney sauce.  Both very nice and attractively presented. The service was very good and the atmosphere in the garden was peaceful.  Can't wait to see who the next ""guest"" chef will be.",50,1049
We're working with the owner of La Morada to find real estate in the area. He invited us for breakfast and it was great! There are friendly birds in the courtyard and the staff is very welcoming. We will return and stay here for a couple nights. Perfect location.,50,1049
"Most fantastic positive experience at this new B&B with very pleasant hard working staff  The inside courtyard wonderful breakfast experience   Chose over Hotel Villa Amor  which was featured wedding venue for all the wedding party (at 73 I was oldest relative of the 24-year of bride)  I love being in middle of this small surfing town two blocks from beach half a block on left is 24-hour convenience store OXXO and half hour on right is 24-hour convenience store Kiosko,   and in front along the quiet street are vendor tables, which on Sunday blossoms into a full outdoor market   Thoroughly recommend ",40,1049
Quintessential B&B in the heart of Sayulita. Gin was so warm and welcoming. Always helpful with suggestions of where to go and what to try. Even an impromptu paddle board lesson.  Rooms are wonderful and don't forget to just stop and chill in the beautiful garden courtyard. Which is also where they serve breakfast ... it is not to be missed.,50,1049
"La Morada was great and the staff were very helpful in providing instructions on how to get there from the airport. My room, #5, was perfect for what I needed and the room faced the courtyard so it was quiet at night. The bed might be small for two people, but worked for me just great. The breakfast each morning was hearty and hit the spot to set me up for a day of surfing each morning. Thanks Gin and the staff for a great stay.  The location was great too... with lots of restaurants nearby. I recommend the one right next door, Pancho's Tacos!",50,1049
The hotel is in the centre of town with bars next to it. Many stairs to get to the room. The staff are no very knowledgeable and try to service the clients and their children while doing. their job and they take money with not receipt and claim not to receive it.,10,1050
"The hotel is right by the plaza and the noise from the bars filters straight into the hotel. The next door neighbour watches tv at full blast from about 5 pm until the bars start. It's impossible to sleep until the bars stop - 1:30 tonight and waiting. Other than that, the room is simple but clean, with a little sunny kitchen, and there is a little rooftop patio.",20,1050
"If you like ugly hotel rooms that are really noisy, then this is the place for you. The room: what words to describe it? Let's see...ugly, devoid of any charm would pretty well sum up the place.  As for noisy, there is no front door; only a wrought iron gate that leads down a dark corridor to the staircase to the rooms on the second and third floor. This means that ALL sounds (passing cars, barking dogs, laughing people) are heard loud and clear inside the room. Add in that the stairwell seems to be especially conceived to magnify all sounds so that even quiet conversations or footsteps will wake you from your sleep! Oh yeah. Did I mention that the beds are somewhat uncomfortable?",10,1050
"Pros: Our room was right on the beach. When the air conditioning went out, the staff had it fixed quickly. The room was large.   Cons: The grounds around the entrance were pretty enough, but around the side and back they were unattractive. Lighting at night was poor and so walking to our room was difficult. No attention to details, paint splashed in windows, the bars on the windows were filthy. The chalk paint used around the sink in the bathroom came off on your fingers when wet. There was no reception area and it was hard to know who was in charge. No daily cleaning, only every 2 days. When toilet paper goes in the basket, it should be emptied daily. I had to ask them to do this. Poor lighting in room, couldn't read.  The location if our room couldn't be beat, but the hotel",30,1051
" was a disappointment. I rated it ""average"" due to the fact we were right on the beach. ",30,1051
…,50,1051
"First the positives: Location is right on the beach. We had the lower room right on the beach and could see surfers and beach action all day. The room had a large kitchen area which we did not use. Our air conditioner stopped working and the staff attended to is quickly. They called a taxi for us when we left. Negatives: No reception area. The grounds when you entered the premises were attractive but around the side it was dirt and some stored junk. Not attractive. At night the lighting was non-existent around the side and it was hard to see the way to our room. The attention to detail was lacking. Windows had paint splashed on them; the chalk based paint around the sink came off on hands when wet. The room was dark, no reading lights. No daily housekeeping, which isn't that",40,1051
" important except to empty the toilet paper basket. I had to ask to have it emptied on the alternate days. Toilet paper in that heat is not pleasant. The bars on the window were filthy. Conclusions:  The room itself was not bad, and location couldn't be beat. But for the price, which was not cheap, I would look for something else next time.",50,1051

"If you have read all of the reviews on here and are confused, allow this particular review to help provide clarity.  Not really a place for kids although it would work fine if your kids aren't squeamish about bugs and geckos.  All adults should have absolutely no problem with this place.  It's not 5 star by any stretch but 2-3 stars for basic amenities.  We rented both upstairs and downstairs just last week.  This was for an all guys week-long stay.  Yes there is the odd bug and gecko.  Yep, no air conditioning.  Fans aplenty above you on the bedframe and on the side.  Plenty enough to keep you cool to sleep.  Upstairs:  Open air suite.  Really cool!  2 king beds.  Sleeps 4 adults comfortably.  Mosquito netting bedframe.  Shower works fine with hot and cold water.  Fridge works",10,1051
" fine.  Did not use stove.  Seating available for about 20 people.  Spacious with both beds on opposite ends of the room.    Downstairs:  Closed / shuttered suite with windows.  Same creature status as the upstairs and same amenities with less available seating.  Bring household bug spray to spray to use in corners and ledges.  We did this just to ensure less creatures as a deterrent.    LOVED the proximity to beach.  Super close.  That alone made the stay worth it.  Wifi available in courtyard only and doesn't reach the rooms.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind the outdoors, camping etc.  If you are looking for 5 star, AC, pampering environment then definitely book elsewhere.  Note:  Early November 2019 there was a bullet hole in the upstairs window.  Not sure how old it was or what happened.  We weren't alarmed  by this as it might have been very old and the area is quite safe.",10,1051

Old school hotel some rooms with no a/c. Beat room is upper beach house room. No lobby see cleaning lady to check in. No paper down toilets but no daily trash service so that was unpleasant. Staff didn’t  pick up empty bottles in common areas. But this beachfront hotel is a bargain if you don’t mind some discomfort ,10,1051
Easy surfing when the surf is lower for beginners.  Not great for non experts during high surf.  Easy access and boards to rent on the beach with lessons cheap.   Go during week days not weekends (too crowded). ,40,1052
"Nos fue un poco difícil encontrar el lugar, pues solo se ve una pequeña puerta con un letrero pequeño. Al llegar tuvimos que pasar por cables y una máquina de soldadura lo cual fue inseguro. Llamamos para que nos dieran la habitación y tardaron unos 10 min, nada grave pues nos dejaron accesar a la terraza que es la única área común de estos estudios. No había protocolos de sanidad, nadie nos tomó la temperatura o nos dio gel ni usaban cubrebocas. Se notaba que mas personas habían estado en la terraza pues los ceniceros estaban llenos. Nos dieron una habitación que no era la que habíamos reservado a través de hoteles.com; nos habían confirmado el estudio 4 con cama queen, un sofá y una área grande de cocina, pero nos dieron el estudio 2 con dos camas matrimoniales y mucho más",20,1053
" pequeño... no era tan especial para celebrar un aniversario. Las habitaciones son muy bonitas y super bien decoradas. El chico que nos entregó nos comentó que todas las habitaciones eran iguales y el precio era el mismo, que es la única habitación que tenían disponible. Depués me comuniqué con la administradora quien mencionó que efectivamente había un error y que sobrevendieron el lugar por culpa de la app de hoteles.com; que solo me podrían ofrecer este cuarto o moverme a otro hotel (ya habíamos desempacado, usado el baño y mi esposo se estaba bañando) dijimos que no pues ya no queríamos seguir perdiendo más tiempo y que preferíamos que nos hicieran un ajuste del precio, lo cual no sucedió.  El ventilador era muy ruidoso y había hormigas por todos lados, incluso tuvimos que tirar nuestra comida pues se llenó de estos animalitos. La ubicación es buena y muy tranquila. Esta a unos pasos de una playa que es bastante solitaria y muy agusto. Por el precio está bien y mucho mejor que otros hoteles, pero no me gustó nada que me dieran otra habitación diferente a lo que yo pagué.",40,1053

"My best friend and I stayed in apartment 3 at North Side Studios. It was a great value for the room and had all of the basic necessities.   What I really liked: - location; it was very close to the beach and the center without being right in the busy area of the plaza. It was no more than a 5-10 minute walk to the main areas and there are plenty of grocery/corner stores and restaurants nearby. - the room; it's a modern decorated studio room with a kitchenette so we could make our own breakfasts/food when we wanted.  - the space; there are 3 other studios and a terrace area, however we never really saw anybody else (probably because we were there during low season).  What I didn't like: - communication with the host was tricky. We had some issues with our AC and also were early",50,1053
"I was planning on renting Cola de Zorro at Siete Palmas in Sayulita. I love this town and place looks beautiful. Unfortunately, with the Covid virus going around, I did not want to fly and the US/Mexico border is closed. Even if it opens, I didn't want to take a chance on not getting my deposit back less than 30 days. I gave my deposit last February. So, Dec. 1, I requested my deposit back. I was informed I would only get back $1500 which is half of what I paid. Rob sent me an email saying he would pay me via Pay Pal the next day. I never received it and he will not return my emails, phone calls or text. By the way, he advertises he'll return your deposit if you cancel up to 48 hours in advance. THIS IS A LIE. What a scam. Very disappointed in his dishonestly.",10,1054
"I have been staying at Siete Palmas every year for the past four years and have grown to love this place - the tranquil swaying palm trees (it's namesake!), the location is perfect, quiet and the accommodations have always been fine. The property managers (love you Marcie, Sylvia and Jorge!) and support staff are the absolute BEST! The property recently sold and the new owner has crammed an invasive four-story unit right next to Siete Palmas, absolutely destroying the ambience and solitude of this property. It was bad enough staying here with all the construction noise (they were supposed to be done by then), but I cannot imagine what this place will be like when all four adjoining units are occupied. I used to cherish sitting out on the palapa deck at night listening to distant",10,1054
" sounds of Sayulita celebrations and gentle surf.  Now, you can hear everything going on in the adjoining units. At night, the lights shine right in to the Siete Palmas bedroom. Solitude - GONE! Privacy - GONE!  The small pool will now be shared by four units. What the hell was this new owner thinking??",30,1054

"Normally I would have rated this place with 4 stars but there were a few things which made me rate it only average.  First what we liked:  The property is beautiful open and airy, one block from the beach, 7 or 8 minute walk to the plaza and downtown Sayulita, has a nice pool right outside the front door and the casita itself has a very nice bathroom area.  Also Jorge the property manager was friendly and efficient when we needed his assistance a couple of times during our 5 day stay.  What could have been better:  we arrived to find the refrigerator which was new, didn't work at all so we had to buy ice to keep things cold.  On the second day Jorge and I moved a refrigerator from the barbecue area by the pool into our casita which solved that problem.  The casita isn't",10,1054
The worst hostel of a two month tour of Mexico. Do not stay here.   We booked two beds in a dorm judging by the photo of the small dorm on bookings.com. The number of beds was not listed.   The dorm we ended up in was 10 beds and terrible.  No working fan Hugely uncomfortable bed The ceiling leaked on to bed and electrics Toilets didn't work properly  The electrics were very unsafe (socket coming out of the wall) The room was teaming with mosquitoes and had no nets / air circulation  The rest of the hostel was also filthy. Dangerous cooking facilities.  When I complained we were told that the kitchen was not for guests.   We cancelled our 2nd and asked to be refunded for the first night. Issac on the front desk was very unhelpful. He agreed that the standard was poor but refused,10,1055

The bungalow at $82US a night had a bottle of water that had been accumulating dust for...10 years. The bedding was 30 years old with 2 limpy pillows but WORSt of all, the mold and mildew was overbearing!!! We got in late at night. I have allergies.

He even called the mechanic and drove us to him in Puerto Vallarta. We love this little gem of a spot and can’t wait to come visit again. We are going to stay here every time we visit.

They also have laundry, WiFi, a place to do dishes, and two cute kitties that run around and hangout with guests. ",50,1056
"We stayed at this place for 6 nights: nice spot, right on the beach, close to surf spot and town, it's true that the facilities could use a little bit more love and also not running down of toilet paper when you pay 400 pesos/day, but over all nice. We were thinking of staying an extra week, so we ask, kindly, to Christina, the owner, if they had a price per week. I guess no: she immediately started to be rude to us by saying that we were not well educated to ask a question like that, that she was well educated because she lived in the USA and that us ""French Canadian"" would be always winning in french (is that racism?) She told us that people who ask that kind of question must leave NOW... so we left, with a bitter taste.",10,1056
"I had a terrible experience in multiple ways. Making and confirming reservations with the owner, Thies, was difficult. He did not respond for several weeks to multiple emails. What he claimed was a beachfront bungalow was actually behind a beachfront bungalow. It had a slice of a view of the ocean from the patio and none at all from the dark room which was dominated by the bed and smelled strongly of mildew. What this place has going for it is its easy access to the beach.  However, that comes with so much noise and on certain nights of the week music so loud that in the owners words “it will shake you out of the bed”.  And it doesn’t stop until 4am.  After one of those sleepless nights (using earplugs and keeping the windows closed didn’t even come close to keeping out the",10,1056

I felt that was generous and I told him so. I thanked him. I then made plans based upon that understanding. When I went to get my refund from his assistant the assistant told me Thies had told him to only give me a partial refund. Since he had no explanation about why Thies was not doing what he had said he would I went to ask Thies why he was not refunding me what he had said he would.  Before I even got out the question he leaned his face in very close to mine and yelled at me: “no negotiation, that’s it!” and walked away. His aggression, along with his word not being trustworthy, along with the noise, the mildew, and the generally unappealing environment of the 2 beachfront bungalows that I saw the inside of cause me to strongly caution anyone who is considering staying here.  I never will again, and I certainly don’t recommend it to anyone.",10,1056

There was even an air of possible physical violence from his part in his way of talking. Quite scary, never had an experience like this in a hostel.

"Atico was the first place I stopped when I made my way to Sayulita. I haven't had a hookah in quite a while and the bar looked super hip, so I figured why not?! I first sat down at the swinging chairs at the bar. I'm not very tall, so once I ordered the hookah I went and sat over at one of their tables in the lounge area. Customer service was excellent. The hookah was amazing and they had a lot of really good IPAs. I hung out there for probably about an hour listening to their music playlist consisting of American 1990 - 2000s hip hop and pop tunes. I didn't get a chance to stay at the hostel but the bar and hookah service overall was superb. If I ever find myself back in Sayulita, I'll definitely consider Atico for a stay. Thanks for the great time, Atico!",40,1061
"We stayed here 2 nights and both evening the Pool was taken over young people who weren't staying at the hotel. Music, drinking, If you want to part with the local kids this is your place. Too bad because it is a very nice view and clean room.",10,1062
"I liked the prices especially. It was affordable. All rooms face the sea, there are palm trees but they don't obstruct very much. The pool is nice, not too much chlorine either. The pool or rooms don't get direct sun, it faces the wrong way for that. You have to chase the sun at the edge of the pool to sunbathe. It's not crowded now, so it wasn't too much of an issue. Security codes to get into the property is good. The location is good very walkable too. Love hearing the waves at night. I got some much needed rest, but if I wanted more night life, it's there for you. I arranged for transportation through them, it cost more but I found it convenient. the car was clean and on time and the driver was very nice. If you do this, ignore all the pressure for taxis as you walk through",30,1062
" the airport, they will. make you feel that they are there waiting for you. they are NOT, your driver will be waiting outside for you with your name on a card. Disliked  · Bed too soft. Strange there were no condiments, you have to bring everything, even salt, pepper and sugar. No one greets you here, that's odd too. it would have been nice to have a few things pointed out to me. I never figured out how to turn the fans off or how to use the coffee maker. I didn't find any instructions. So I bought instant coffee. Lots of instructions on how to tip. the room is fine, but the one I had was too close to the ground, I could see people walk right past my room, a bit uncomfortable sometimes. Finally, there are no screens on the doors so it would have been nice to have mosquito netting over the beds. Thankfully the bugs weren't terrible, I got 3 or 4 bits during the night. Oh, and they ask you to wear these stupid wrist bands like we are kids on a spring break. I never wore mine because the place wasn't crowded and it wasn't an issue, but I don't care for this policy anywhere I go. The place asks for practically the full payment upfront, they keep a portion if you change your mind so be sure before you book. even after 24 hrs, you're locked in. Don't care for that too much.",50,1062

Wow !! This place is amazing. The staff was awesome and the on-site maintenance man was so professional and friendly. I can’t wait to go back with our family. The views were amazing and located steps from the beach. You can walk everywhere because of how close everything is. ,50,1062
"We stayed there for 4 weeks and loved it.  Very quiet, clean and upscale.  King bed is very comfortable, kitchen well appointed, maid service daily.  The plentiful supply of plush towels is amazing.  Loved the proximity to town, beach, just steps away.  Pool area is very large but seating is set up for privacy.  Grounds immaculate and constantly managed by friendly staff.  Going back for another 4 weeks Feb. 2019. ",50,1062
"Perfect location....perfect accommodations.....right at the beach, but also a nice pool and a balcony with each room....walking distance to all the wonderful restaurants.  We have come to Sayulita many times and stayed in some wonderful places, but this is without question my favorite.  ",40,1062
"This place was nice, clean and had a great pool that overlooked the beach which is right across the street.  The room has double-pane windows which drown out all the outside noise.  Also, about a 5 minute walk from the middle of town, it's the perfect place to stay.  Oh, the little kitchen has a blender and we were able to make our own fruit smoothies every day!!",50,1062
It was perfect walking distance to the beach perfect walking distance of the restaurant everything was clean the only problem was the water coming through the shower TV was kind a high and small but the view and the place and the staff everybody was great,50,1062
"La Esquina has everything you want for an amazing, stress-free stay in Sayulita. It's right on the beach, has an infinity pool that overlooks the ocean (and the beach-side bar!), and is a couple minutes' walk to the main square in Sayulita. The whole complex (8 units or so) is gated, so it feels very safe. The room has excellent A/C (not the case at all places to stay in Sayulita!), a safe, great wifi, a balcony, and is very clean. Our unit also included a kitchen. All units also include a water filter machine (hot or cold options), which was extremely handy so we didn't have to buy bottled water everywhere. The location could not have been better-it was extremely close to the main square, but we also discovered it was near just about anything else we wanted to see or do during",50,1062
"Después de que tuvimos problemas con otro hotel, que Sayulita estaba hasta el tope ese fin de semana, fuimos recibidos con las puertas abiertas en este hermoso lugar. Están a 10min del pueblo de Sayulita, pero la verdad no importa mucho. Las cabañas son hermosas, te desconectas de todo, y el cielo en la noche es impresionante. Nos trataron súper bien :D Esperamos volver muy pronto, estamos realmente muy agradecidos porque hicieron de nuestra estancia algo memorable. 100% recomendables.",50,1063
"While we've visited Sayulita before, this time we decided to stay overnight and see what the nightlife was like. We chose to stay at Posada Estrella as it was advertised on both AirBnB and on Expedia. We booked through Expedia but were suspiciously asked via email to pay again using a different method. We ignored that request and had no problem checking in. Good thing we were careful!   The room was a studio with a ""kitchenette"" and a cold, weak, gravity fed shower. We felt like natives ;-} But the location was close to the center of town and we only crashed in the room anyway. As a plus, there was wifi available.  By the way, the nightlife was wonderful and perfectly safe. We had a great time drinking from an outside ""bar"". It was a small cart with a DJ playing from his laptop!",30,1064
"This is a wonderful relaxing and safe place to stay. I have now been to the bungalows twice over 2 years, and be assured we will be back.  It is 2 blocks from the beach, it is in the main square for shopping and food, yet is still extremely quiet. It has a very homey yet authentic feel to it.  I would suggest it to anyone.",50,1065
"Just returned from a 10 day vacation in Sayulita, Mexico and stayed  at this wonderful little hotel.  The location was perfect, right on the plaza and just 2 blocks from the beach.  It was over Halloween and it was so much fun to celebrate in the plaza and enjoy some of the culture of Mexico.  This hotel is right in the middle of the fun, but surprisisngly quiet and secluded.  The garden environment was peaceful and beautiful.  I would highly recommend it. Great value!!",40,1065
"Los recomiendo muchísimo tienen todo lo que buscaba y era la primera vez que íbamos a sayulita..el cuarto limpio, el servicio y todo lo que necesitábamos lo teníamos a la mano, la encargada Sandra fue muy servicial desde que llegamos el primer día la verdad nos gusto mucho y vamos a volver..",50,1065
"we had the nicest stay st Casa Conchita. Who knew this idellic gem was hidden away right off of the plaza!  We loved the rooms, and the patio-and having a coffee shop and cafe downstairs is a huge bonus!   You cannot beat the space for this price so look no further! ",50,1066
"Villa Poema de Amor is a beautiful three floor, 3/4 unit house with the best views in all of Sayulita.  Our family of eleven rented the entire house for Thanksgiving vacation 2015, and we could not have made a better decision.  All three floors have 180 degree views of Sayulita bay and the ocean, and the infinity pool overlooks the town and Sayulita bay.  The concierge, Nick, was so helpful and responsive over email to coordinate our airport pickup, golf cart rental (highly recommended!), horseback riding, surfing, and even bringing us homemade pumpkin pies on Thanksgiving Day.  The onsite housekeeper, Ines, kept the property beautiful all week long (quite a feat with 5 teens), and she even made a wonderful, huge breakfast for us on several occasions.  The house is perfectly",50,1067
" located just above Villa Amor on the south end of the beach, and has its own trail right down to Playa de los Muertos.   Our stay at Villa Poema de Amor was the perfect choice for our family vacation to Sayulita.",50,1067
"We have been visiting Sayulita for more than 15 years and have watched businesses change and grow. With a multitude of options available, I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Shelby and Javier have created a remarkable oasis in the heart of this bustling yet charming village add to that their local knowledge, bicycles and surf lessons, and the newly renovated spaces. Seriously. It doesn’t get any better. ",50,1068
"We LOVE Casa Conchita.  We have stayed there twice, and have nothing but good words for this little gem. The newly remodeled rooms are amazing, the location cannot be beaten, and the new coffee house, Cafe Miscelanea, is the BOMB!    We borrowed their bicycles, rented their surf boards, and even took a private surf trip with Bicho, one of the owners.  Seriously, stop looking and just book a room. You won't regret it.",50,1068
"There is so much to tell about this extraordinaire B & B.  Beginning with our host Bernadette', an amazing woman with impeccable taste to create  and capture the comforts of home, all the while embracing the ecological environment, which surrounds her lovely home. Not a single need was not met during our brief 3 day visit.  The food served was fresh and tasty, served like we were royalty, on fine china and linens.  All the while the mood set with candles, music and lighting, delightful ! The rooms are new, clean, beautifully decorated including fine bed linens. With all Bernadette's talents she brings to her casa, she shares her love of animals that she has adopted. This creates a circle of loving, a  well behaved cast of canine characters that no one could not love. The views",50,1069
" are really, quite unbelievable, all the while hearing the constant waves of the ocean.  If that isn't enough the mountains, and jungle provide a stunning and beautiful landscape .  The most beautiful birds and wildlife right there surrounding the home, providing a constant spa like ""sonata"". Romantic, or Zen either way, this is a rare find. It's number one on my list, for every year.",50,1069
…,50,1069
"Very beautiful and relaxing! Great host and wonderful breakfast.  It's a bit of a walk, but worth every step and so peaceful. Our stay here with Dadu made our vacation! Highly recommend staying here if you're in Sayulita. ",50,1069
"Hola, me recomendaron mucho este lugar y me gustaría contactarme con ustedes y conocer los servicios que ofrecen porque me gustaría viajar con mi pareja, por favor algún teléfono o correo electrónico. Muchas gracias!   :)",50,1069
"This place is hand down the best hostel of all time. I made the mistake of booking it for only 3 days and then switching to Selina. Although, Selina is nice it doesn’t have the magic of Viajero. Selina is nice on the outside but the rooms are dark and musty. Viajero has amazing activities, an incredible view and the vibes are high. It doesn’t hurt that everyone there is super good looking. I was traveling solo and met friends I will know forever. The atmosphere of Viajero brings people together. I should also add that this place is insanely clean, bright and airy. I can’t wait to stay at Viajero again! P.S. The staff deserves a raise",50,1071
"The deck, pool, and rooftop bar are absolutely stunning! But I wish I had stayed somewhere else as this hostel is best suited for 20-something heavy drinkers, I think.   My private room was lovely if pricey at over $100 usd/night once you add in taxes. The free morning yoga, Friday salsa lessons, and breakfast are nice perks. But the place is just constantly loud and I really struggled to sleep with some of the drunker guests pretty much screaming outside my window all night. I felt bad for the hostel's neighbors, as this place really does seem like a menace in an otherwise quiet part of town.  Also the Internet is terribly slow at best and frequently didn't work at all. ",30,1071
We had a amazing journey in Sayulita specially thanks to the Hostel which is very nice (the breakfast and the view ). The staff is amazing and we made a great team between guests and staff members. We loved it so much as we also extended our trip. Definitely the best place to stay in Sayulita ! You will love it !! And last but no least do not forget to try the yoga classes (included)   on the rooftop before breakfast !,50,1071
"Las instalaciones son buenas, y el trato del personal excelente. Te hacen sentir como en casa. Son cercanos, atentos, la comida es estupenda y siempre están dispuestos a atender cualquiera de tus peticiones con una sonrisa. Si vuelvo a Sayulita repetiré.",50,1071
"Las recepcionistas en especial nina son muy gentiles y se toman el tiempo de darnos recomendaciones para el viaje. La comida es de 5 estrellas y a buen precio Dani, Alejandro y Gabriel son extremadamente atentos. Andrés el bar tender hace unos cócteles espectaculares!  Hay un ambiente familiar en el hostal, la alberca es riquísima con una vista divina de la playa y tienen buena música. Los cuartos son muy limpios el clima funciona riquísimo las camas son cómodas y el cuarto privado de verdad vale la pena.   En general una experiencia muy acogedora, familiar y relajada pero divertida!",50,1071
"Photos tell all. What you see is what really is.  Eric, Rosey and Meche, the house keepers, are treasures and will go out of their way to please. I highly recommend giving yourself a gift and have them cook dinner for you.",50,1072
"We stayed @ Casa Buque to celebrate a special birthday for my sister that incl. my 80yr+ Mom and 2 best friends; 5 women, we had a blast!! The house is in a beautiful setting, french doors for lovely ocean breezes and falling asleep to sound of crashing waves. The house was authentic in style, decor, comfort, and all around accommodations. The staff of this property is lovely, including a very friendly little pup named Lulu!!! We had them cook for us a few times and both meals were delish. The house was even decorated for my sisters birthday, per my prior request. They lit the pool with candles and glow sticks, such fun. I would definitely stay here again. FYI, the pool is not heated, but it's probably not necessary most times of the year. There are steps in and out of the",50,1072

"The house is off the beaten path, very beautiful surroundings, very comfortable, complete with everything you need. Rosie, Meash, and Eddie are there to manage and care for your needs. They made us 2 fabulous meals and it was great to have someone cook, serve and clean up.  The private beach, and small pool are a plus. A wonderful time Was had by All, 5 of us. Myself, my 2 daughters and 2 of their friends, all adults.",50,1072
"We have been renting Casa Buque (lower level) many times over the past ten years or more. The house is consistently well maintained and comfortable. We love the quiet location that is convenient to the town, the friendly and helpful caretakers, and the house itself.  This house is perfect for two couples traveling together or a small family. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with an open sitting area and kitchen in the middle. The views are amazing and the small pool is a nice addition. ",50,1072
"We rented all three of the casas.  They have one of the best locations in Sayulita.  There is semi-private beach, beautiful views of the ocean, and a nice small pool.  The location is about a mile from town.  We rented gas powered golf carts b/c I had young kids and grandparents.  The roads at first are a little intimidating, but not bad if you get the gas powered golf carts.  It is very convenient to Playa del Muerto and the beach at the bottom of the hill is good for supervised young children.  The owner is very nice and all the staff are very accommodating.",40,1072
"My husband and I spent a long weekend in the upstairs unit at Casa Buque in early December 2013, and we found it to be one of the most relaxing places we've ever stayed in Sayulita. The private beach accessible just down the stairs was a glorious swimming beach just around the point from Playa los Muertos. The deck and room provided endlessly fascinating viewing to what we came to call ocean TV. During our time there, we saw schools of fish jumping to escape predators from below, whale spouts, shrimp boats, and even a stand-up paddle board race.The on-site manager was responsive and helpful when we had questions or issues. The kitchen is pretty basic--good enough for breakfast or a snack, but I wouldn't want to try to prepare many full meals in it. It's maybe a 10-minute walk",50,1072
"We are extremely happy with our 7 day stay at La Villa Buena Vida.  Our casita Limon room was perfect.  Quite, and very roomy, lux bedding, and the shower water pressure was refreshingly wonderful.  The small fridge kept our beer & wine cold plus food for quick snacks and meals.  The room was furnished with a roomy armoire, and the kitchenette cabinet was well stocked with cook and barware.  Downtown and beaches are an easy quick walk (comfortable shoes in Sayulita are a must)  Owners are incredibly generous with their knowledge of the area.  And the best part was the beautiful pool.  (towels provided).  I highly recommend this property.  NOTE some units have full kitchens, and would be great for group getaways.",50,1073
"New owners, lots of updates, traditional Mexican style decor. One two bedroom, two bath (sleeps 4), three one bedroom units (sleeps 3) each with fully equipped kitchen, bathroom. One studio with bath.  C Entire villa can be rented accommodates 15 people.",50,1073
"My family and I stayed here for a week last july and we're already missing it so much, we had a great time and loved the location of this property, it is close to downtown and beach, the courtyard is very nice we had an amazing time there  and the pool is great for kids and adults. Sayulita is a wonderful magic town and Villa la Buena Vida is a great place to stay, we hope be back there soon.",50,1073
"It's a bit scary choosing accommodations on the internet -  sight unseen, with minimal reviews - especially when the cost of the place is fairly inexpensive. We took a risk and were pleasantly surprised. My partner and I stayed in Casita Papaya - a one bedroom unit on the ground floor - for two weeks this winter. Villa Buena Vida was exactly what we were looking for. This is not a high end, luxury place but it is super clean, comfortable and has an ""at home"" feeling about it.  Now, for those who are into cleanliness - The whole place was absolutely spotless! There is a small ""dipping"" pool which was cleaned several times a week. It was great for dunking into after a hot day on the beach. The patio, grounds and common kitchen/gathering spot were all well maintained. Although maid",50,1073
" service is offered weekly, the staff were around everyday and were happy to clean as needed/desired. There were plenty of towels, the bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was fully equipped with pots and pans, dishes, a full fridge, stove, microwave, a blender, and lots of ice cube trays. Purified water was always available. Since it is a smaller complex, we were concerned about noise from neighbours, but we soon found that the other guests staying there were very mindful of each other and we had no issues at all. The spot is located in an older part of town, about a 6 minute walk along a cobblestone street to the town plaza. We rented the property through Primavera Properties and we cannot say enough about the women who booked the accommodation for us. Ilsa and Virginia were absolutely wonderful. They were so very helpful and happy to answer all our questions before arriving in Sayulita. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Sayulita. The price was extremely reasonable, and the space was suitable for all ages. We met some great people and made a couple of nice friends while staying here.",20,1073
Dairy free options! I got the most delicious ice popsicle which was effectively a whole bunch of the most delicious fruit on a stick.  My friend had an ice cream in a cone and she also loved it! Would definitely return.,50,1074
"Wa kika is always the finish to great night in town. The selection of fresh fruit popsicles with and without sugar, with and without dairy are incredible. I’ve been going here for years and love it every time I return. We need these in the United States.",50,1074
"Great location.  They're right by the main plaza and a short walk to the beach.  The rooms are pretty clean.  I stayed in the Oceano room, which is between the Sol and Playa rooms.  Noise wasn't much of an issue.  The Playa room has a window overlooking the street.  I was worried about the noise given it's location, but It was not an issue.  Bring earplugs if you're a very light sleeper just in case.  There's an Oxxo and Kiosko nearby that are open 24/7 (if I'm not mistaken).  I would definitely stay here again.    After booking via the website, you will receive an email with their direct phone number and instructions to deposit one night's stay via paypal or their bank acct.  You can call them if you have any questions or concerns.",40,1074
"This place is on top of the ice cream parlour by the same name. It is family-owned, well-kept, with friendly and accommodating service. It is located right in the center of Sayulita, only a minute ti the beach (unless you have really bad flip-flops!). The rooftop terrace is really nice. ",50,1074
"We stayed from Sunday to Tuesday and it was perfect. It comes with a kitchenette and your own bathroom. A couch to relax on and of course your comfy bed. It was clean and the terrace was nice. No walking through a hotel to get to it, right outside your door AND the ice cream shop down stairs was delicious! Beach was a few blocks away so if you forget something you can just walk right back to your room no problems. ",50,1074
"I just got back from Sayulita and already want to go back. Wa kika was the perfect choice, as I like to be in the heart of everything when travelling solo. I stayed in the Oceano studio, which was super-cute and spotless and well-appointed, with lots of space for one person and cozy for a couple. Great little mini-kitchen with a comfy sitting area by the window. The unit had lots of hot water, plug-in outlets and strong wifi, and AC, which was a nice bonus but not necessary with the ceiling fan. The bed was comfortable and soft by Mexico standards from what I understand. Great value for the price.   The rooftop terrace is the kicker, a wonderful place to relax and meet fellow travellers and enjoy the view. You're literally a two minute walk to the beach and in the centre of town",50,1074

You can't beat the location if you want to be in town -- it's above the Wa kika ice cream shop! I had an ice cream at least once a day, so delish. Tessa and Rodrigo were wonderful hosts, very helpful and kind, and Tessa helped me sort out surfing lessons with an awesome teacher (see the Surf It Out review). All in all, couldn't have asked for a better experience, and will definitely stay there if I get to visit Sayulita again!",50,1074

And look out for the iceream shop right below. It will get you everytime with the most delicious treat on a hot sunny day!  The hospitality there is so great and all the rooms are very clean. With only 3 rooms on a private roof top, it feels very comforting and relaxing. It's nice walking to your own little roof top patio everytime you return to your room. With everything being so close, it's easy to walk back and fourth throughout the day without having to plan to pack for the whole day. I felt very safe and welcome here.

"This place was totally amazing!  Pictures do not do it justice.  There were 5 family members staying here, and we all had plenty of room.  Everything we needed for a month's stay was supplied, and Moises, the gardener, and Nati, the maid, were there every week making sure the grounds and pool were kept up and we hade fresh sheets and towels, and the house was thoroughly cleaned.  The nicest, most gracious people who did everything they could to help.  We were about two miles from town, a fairly easy walk on a jungle path, which we took several times each week.  We would take a cab back to the casa (about 10 buck one way) as the walk back uphill was very challenging!  We ended up saving a lot of money doing this versus renting a gas golf cart or a car.  Also ended up losing some",50,1075
" weight which was great!  It is incredibly beautiful at the casa.  We enjoyed long, lazy warm days on the decks and at the pool, gazing out at the ocean in front of us.  We saw lots of whales, and incredible sunsets every single night.  I was worried about getting bored, but that never happened.  We read a lot and drank lots of pena coladas and bloody marys   The morning light coming into the house was warm and peaceful, and every morning there was a scratch on the kitchen door and there would be Ella, the sweetest dog ever, who lived next door, coming over  for her morning treat and belly rub.  She liked hanging out at the pool with us too.  We all adored her.  We stopped at Le Comer grocery store (very very nice!) outside of PV and stocked up on groceries on our way fto the casa from the airport, and cooked several nights a week.  The other days or nights we ate in Sayulita.  You will not run out of fabulous places to eat, and we were there a month.  We hated to leave, and are already making plans to go back.  ",50,1075

"The moment you walk through the gate you are greeted with fantastic views which take your breath away! The house is big, spacious and superbly furnished with all the facilities you would expect with such a lovely property. We have never been somewhere where we have felt compelled to relax and watch the world go by both in the garden and the pool - including witnessing the most fabulous sunset!! Sadly our stay was far too short but if you are looking to get away from everything except the sound of the ocean and birds then this is the place for you. Highly recommended.",50,1075
"This house is one of the best-kept secrets in Mexico! I stayed with my young family and we had the trip of a lifetime. The views and ambience are 'magical', really something that is hard to describe. A typical day was waking up and having breakfast as the sun comes over the mountains behind - walking to the secluded beaches through the jungle paths - jumping in the pool - bird watching - lying in the hammock - trip into town for dinner and nightlife. I took some drone shots to try and do the place justice in picture form, but its impossible! I will say that its more for outdoor/nature lovers, not a 5 star all inclusive hotel! It's best if you have transport to drive to and from the house to town. I cannot recommend this experience enough, I have stayed all over Mexico, central",50,1075
"This might be a great place but the photo attached is from CASA DUENDE not Casa Duende Vista, 2 totally separate places. Casa Duende, located a block from the town square and the beach, is a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom vacation rental with a fantastic outdoor patio as shown in the photo.",50,1076

Mario (the owner) is friendly and helpful, and the accomodations are hilltop which means there is a cool breeze throughout the day - very welcome when relaxing during the day out of the heat.

Opt for a room with basic amenities like a small fridge, coffee maker, microwave, blender, or if you plan to cook, they have units with stove-tops too.   Very centrally located, less than a minute's walk to the plaza. Not the place for a quiet retreat, but perfect if you're up for a party every night! Music stops at 2am promptly though and bungalows further back should be quieter.   It's great value for the location and views.",40,1076
"WOW where do I begin?!  My husband and I stayed at Casa Duende for 3 nights after ending up there by last minute reroute as Tulum (Yucatan Peninsula) was evacuated due to Hurricane Rina.  Man OH man do things happen for a reason! Sayulita is absolutely gorgeous and a true tunnel to authentic relaxation.  The rooms are very artsy and gorgeous with breathtaking views.  My husband was concerned that there was no air conditioning but because of the location up the hill, the breeze at night was more than enough and we were never uncomfortable.  No need for bug nets either and we kept the large windows open at all times! The owner, Mario, built the place himself and his dedication and love for it are transparent.  Mario hosted an authentic Mexican barbecue and we had an unforgettable",50,1076

Arrived with no vacancy's in the entire town. But they had another amazing room for us. Every time we brought a friend over they could not believe how nice it is. Neither can we. Still best place to stay in Sayulita. This was our second time there in two years.,50,1076
"stayed in the English Country suite which is compact but works for a couple.  A galley kitchen equipped well enough to make breakfast and light snacks.  The grounds are beautiful and well maintained with lovely views over the bay.  Sadly, We missed all of the sunrises and sunsets because it rained consistently all 5 days we were there.  Santiago very helpful to hook up the DVD and bring us some movies to watch!  Also, he offered to go to town for us if needed to buy groceries.  Our only cautionary comment would be that this lovely oasis is a trade off for convenience to being closer to the town.  We opted to use taxis instead of golf carts .  there are still hills and stairs to climb even with golf cart rental or cars so if you have any mobility issues (which we have) it did",40,1077

"Wow this place is a little slice of heaven! The view is spectacular, the gardens are perfectly maintained and immaculate and the house is beautifully furnished and decorated. The host, her family and the house manager are incredibly friendly and helpful. Can’t say enough good things about this place- me and my my family absolutely loved it. This place is just perfect. Stay here! You won’t regret it! I know I will be back! :-)",50,1077
"From the moment I first inquired about this place, Suzanne was very attentive and quick to communicate. She made the process quick and easy, being very accommodating, and helpful. A golf cart is not necessary but there are many stairs which was good exercise and needed to balance the lounging around the pool and beach time. The place was spotless and cleaned every day but Sundays. Santiago and Tiade were very friendly and knowledgeable, should you want any recommendations on great places to eat, etc. The view is amazing and looks down upon the bay. It's a great place to get away from all the hustle happening on the beach and town. Sayulita is a neat place to visit with the downtown square coming alive at night. We had a friend meet us for a few days, he returned to extend his",50,1077

"Last week my family and I had the wonderful pleasure of staying at Casa Kukana.  I knew I was going to love it based on the photos online but the actual house/grounds far exceeded my wildest expectations.  Our family of 6 rented all 3 rooms and had plenty of space.  The yard is simply divine with beautiful and lush gardens, plenty of lounge chairs to relax in, an adorable shaded gazebo area and a gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the main beach of Sayulita.  I loved that the home was up in the hills with a jungle feel and secluded from the hustle and bustle yet only a 5 minute walk or drive to town/the beach.  I woke up every morning to watch the sunrise with the best view ever and LOVED watching the sunset and also some awesome thunderstorms from the yard.  The rooms were all",10,1077
" decorated with such great style (love the Moroccan vibe) and were kept very clean.  Everything you can think of is provided (wifi, AC which feels amazing after a long day being outside, clean towels and beach towels, a BBQ, Smart TVs, a continuous flow of fresh water in a jug, everything you need to cook/eat, etc.).  The owner, Suzanne, was so helpful and responsive when we were booking the place.  We feel like she is one of our friends now :)  Unfortunately we missed meeting her in person as she was out of the country but we had the absolute honor to meet Santiago and Asuzana (who live onsite) and they were overly helpful every single day and the hardest workers ever!!!!  They took wonderful care of the rooms which were always immaculate when we came back.  Santiago gave us rides anywhere we needed (even in the pouring rain).  They made us amazing dinners and drinks (the best we had in Sayulita) and helped us with laundry (for a very reasonable fee which was 100% worth it).  Meeting their family was the icing on the cake.  They went over and above to make our stay even more enjoyable (including putting together a birthday party for one of the kids: pinatas, cake, games and all).  Bottom line is CASA KUKANA IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO STAY.  Our kids loved it so much and said we always have to stay at this house when we come to town.  It is wonderful for couples and families alike.  One piece of advice: do not rent a big car.  Golf carts are much more convenient.  Sayulita is now deeply engrained in my heart and I will 100% be coming back regularly and staying at Casa Kukana which is my definition of paradise!!!!! You will NOT regret making the choice to stay here!   The best part is that it costs the same as a 3 star motel in California (where I live), SUCH A BARGAIN!!!!!! AMAZING PLACE with WONDERFUL PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",50,1077

"We stayed over the Christmas vacation and had an incredible time.  Our appartment was comfortable, very clean and had all the amenities needed to dine in every day/night if we wished.  The patio and pool area is so relaxing and inviting.  Our hosts (David & Michael) were attentive and informative.  They arranged for the most amazing whale watching tour with Nico. Due to new Canadian regulations, they even made our COVID tests appointments and followed up with the clinic for us.  We were in excellent hands which made our three week stay safe, worry free and too short!  The location is minutes from town and the beach but far enough to ensure a level of seclusion.  We love Xocotla and will be returning!",50,1078
"Just wanted to give Xocotla a big big shout out.  We just returned from a three week stay and can't say enough about how amazing this rental was!! We stayed in Amixtli and absolutely loved it as a couple.  It had a perfect kitchen, wonderful breezes, nice big king comfortable bed, super comfy pillows, great shower and roomy bathroom as well.  The pool is amazing and because it's only a few units you have great privacy.  Martina our cleaner was there multiple times during our stay and was a joy to try our Spanish with.  David and Michael the owners / hosts were more than accommodating as well greeting us on our arrival and making sure our ride to the airport got us picked up as well.  We had a great grill night also!!  We can't wait to return and would highly recommend this",50,1078
" place!!!  I will also  say the unit was super well kept and clean, the pictures are exactly what you get.  We can't wait to come back thank you Xocotla!!!",50,1078
…,50,1078
Had the luck of meeting David and Michael and their adorable dog Harry when we and another couple visited and stayed at Xocotla. We had always been at all inclusives so staying right in a Mexican town was a bit of a culture shock. David and Michael were perfect hosts and told us all the ins and outs. Their place is really comfortable and relaxing. We had the pleasure of going to dinner with our hosts at an excellent restaurant they suggested. Everything is nearby but the stairs or hill in and out of the downtown were a little daunting for someone like me with knee issues. Golf carts are available for rent but a little pricey. Dont be shy to take a cab. Prices are reasonable and the drivers seem quite happy to take you long or short distances. Had a lovely romantic dinner on the,50,1078
 ocean's edge on our last night at Si Senor. Whale watching at Sayulita Orca with Nico was a breathtaking experience. You'll never get closer to the whales that this! Truly a memorable holiday. ,50,1078
…,50,1078
"I love the fact that Xocotla is located very close to the plaza but at the same time right in the jungle. The neighbourhood is quiet and it's very easy to walk around. The building is set up on a hill and somewhat elevated which allow you to enjoy a nice breeze and the ocean view. There are 3 apartments or studio to choose from, whatever fits your budget or needs The place is well maintained. Michael and David are great hosts and are very helpful if you need advice about Sayulita. Will be back for sure!",50,1078
"I stayed at Xocotla for the last 4 weeks and can't sat enough good things about it to do it justice.  For one the owners David and Michael are most welcoming and made me feel like part of their family.  They're a fountain of information for all things Sayulita and its local customs and festivals as they're very involved with the local community.  But that's a bonus on their actual property as Xocotla is a hidden sanctuary in the heart of Sayulita.  It's only a 3 minute walk from the central plaza and 5 minutes from the beach, yet you would think you were  miles away as you're nestled amongst their beautiful gardens,   The apartments are so well equipped that you only need to bring your clothes.  Seriously I had a fully equipped kitchen and everything else you could want for a",50,1078
" beach holiday.  They provide beach umbrellas, boogie boards, even a Frisbee! It was a joy staying there and was very sad to leave but I'll certainly be back!",50,1078
"10/10 for our stay. We've been coming to Sayulita for 15 years and this is hands down the best place we've stayed. Hospitable, clean, spacious, and super pretty. Right on the beach and the perfect walking distance from town. I want to move in permanently.",50,1079
"We are a family of six adults. I am so happy we found Las Hamacas. Three spacious onsuites with king size cozy beds. Each of the onsuites have there own unique design. The living area had plenty of room for everyone. Pool right outside the back door. Two minute walk to the beach. If you rent a golf cart you can go anywhere in town within minutes. Management, security gaurd, and maid staff where all very helpful and kind. We hope to be back next year!!",40,1079
"My extended family rented three houses at Las Hamacas for a 7-day family vacation at Christmas time.  We had done lots of online research and reading of reviews before booking, and we had an absolutely fabulous time.  We had three generations represented, ranging in age from 1 year old to 70 years old, and I can truly say that it was just what we’d been hoping for.  The houses were spacious, clean, colorful, beautifully decorated (yet not too fussy) and managed to be kid-friendly. We loved that daily maid service was included in our rental too!  Each house has a very different layout, so you’ll want to study the diagram to see what would work best for you. The houses were connected by a walkway with a pool (heated by the sun only) in the center and a nice lounge area around the",50,1079
" pool.  But the big draw was the beach…just on the other side of the gate. We had beautiful views, excellent beach access and close walks to shops in the town. Lawn chairs and umbrellas were provided with each house, which made it extra convenient. The office staff at Las Hamacas was friendly and responsive to our needs.  We have already told so many people about this wonderful place. We definitely plan to return.",50,1079

"I love this place - great location, right on the beach and exactly what we needed for our vacation! The staff was responsive and helpful, plenty of room to spread out and very comfortable. This was our second visit and just as great as the first time!",50,1079
"This was our second stay at Las Hamacas. Location is perfect for Sayulita - far enough outside of the town core to be nice and quiet, but just a short walk away. The space is amazing with comfortable, spacious bedrooms and fantastic common areas inside and out. We'll be back!",50,1079
"This villa exceeded all of my expectations! The location was absolutely perfect, right on the beach, north of the crowded center of town, but only a short walk via sand or road with so many fabulous restaurants nearby. The kitchen was decent for cooking (not necessary but we made our breakfasts and one dinner), WiFi is strong (if you must stay “plugged in”), and there’s stylish comfortable furniture inside and out. The hot water heater works well but is smallish, (that’s more of a factoid, not a complaint) and there’s a washer and dryer so you can pack clean clothes when you sadly have to leave… I almost don’t want to share this review because it may not be available for me next time!",50,1079
Just returned from a wonderful stay at Las Hamacas.  We were in the Casa Alegria unit.  We were three couples and had plenty of room.  The compound is right on the Beach a bit North of town.  It is quiet and away from the thumping late night Bar Scene noise that can be annoying if staying in town or in the hills overlooking town.  It is flat at Las Hamacas so can be great for older folks (like us) who don't want to do 150-200 steps to get to a place overlooking town.  Communication with Las Hamacas was easy and quick.  We booked directly which I think was a bit less expensive. Place was spotless. Roomy.  Good WiFi.  Daily maid service. Kitchen great.  Bathroom great.  Hot water good.  Bed comfortable. Easy walk on beach or by streets to downtown.  Fine restaurants within a few,50,1079
 blocks.  We are already looking at our future calendar to plot a return.  If there were six stars to give I would do so.,50,1079
"I stayed at Macondo for 5 months and Charlie and Mel made it feel like home for me. It is the best location in Sayulita, on the north side and less than a 5min walk to the beach and has a secure access so I always felt safe. The bungalow was equipped with everything I needed for my stay and more, the complex is really well maintained and there is daily cleaning service if you need it. I loved having the pool to cool off on hot days, they also provide beach chairs, towels, umbrellas etc which are a really nice addition. I recommended friends to stay here and I look forward to coming back and staying with them again.",50,1080
"Melanie and Charlie made me feel like I had come home again and after staying there a couple of times,it’s exactly how I felt!What a great location and what great people, including the people that were staying in the other bungalows... Great location—-close to the beach close to town what more could you ask for? ",50,1080
"Macondo Bungalows is a lovely, old Mexico style property with multiple room options. We stayed in the Traveler Palm for 3 nights.  The price is right for high season - albeit it simple accommodations.  Nothing fancy.  The bed would be challenging for us for more than three nights but others may not mind.  It’s open air so you can hear more than you may want to sometimes, but that’s part of the charm.  The location has a secure entrance.  The owner was helpful and welcoming.   ",40,1080
"I had the Courtyard bungalow for 11 days.  It is nice and quiet, back from the street, and has a great little area in the kitchen to do computer work from. Cleaning service was excellent, even my shirts were rolled up or folded.  Highly recommended.",50,1080
"Hello.. stayed here for 3 nights in January. We had the ""Courtyard"", and our friends had the ""Sunset"".  Both up one flight, and we shared the Terrace which included a huge open air-palapa covered kitchen. The place was extremely clean. Our room had a nice living room area,  comfy queen size bed, and bathroom. Safety deposit box as well. The Bungalows is in a great location. A few short blocks to the beach, a few blocks the other way to the plaza. Lots of stores and restaurants close by.   Owners of the resort were friendly and accommodating.  Rooms very traditional Mexican. Loved this place and would highly recommend, would definitely stay here again.",50,1080
"This was our second time in Sayulita and we loved it. Melanie and Charlie are great hosts. Three was always a good supply of Beach towels and chairs plus two boogie boards and a surf board. Two blocks from the beach so I would check the waves, then come back for which ever board would work best for me. The kitchen and patio were our go to place to relax first thing in the morning and last thing at night.  The bed was comfortable and bathroom was all that we need - sink, toilet and shower with good flow.  I can't comment on the living room as we never used it!  It looked nice when we passed through it to the bedroom. Compared to our Canadian home with double glazed windows and insulation, Sayulita is noisy.  Ear plugs are available if this bothers you, I think this will be the",40,1080

Very clean and comfortable, and our hosts Melanie and Charles were very accommodating as we needed to make a last minute change by a whole week. Unfortunately through injury we were unable to take advantage of the beach toys that were on offer. Well located it was far enough away from any noise from restaurants and bars. Would highly recommend to make this your no. 1 choice while in Sayulita and we would love to return to this quaint little town. Sonya and Gary, New Zealand",50,1080

Right next to the bedroom there is a small living room with 2 couches (very comfy also) and a table. The room has a safety box for you to use at no extra charge.  - The room is very fresh, even cold at times! Please note that we stayed during December. - Right outside the room there is the kitchen, which is under a palapa. The kitchen has everything you need to cook some delicious breakfast. - The owners are super nice and let you borrow chairs, umbrellas and towels for you to take to the beach. - The beach is 2 blocks away, a 5-10 minute walk depending on how fast you are. - The plaza is 3 blocks away, a 5-10 minute walk as well. - We",50,1080

"I can't say enough wonderful things about our stay and wedding here. If you are hoping to get married at a villa in Sayulita, this is THE PLACE!   The Villa is gorgeous and right on the beach, filled with lush jungle plants and bougainvillea. Eating breakfast at the outdoor dinning table and lounging by the infinity pool was our daily ritual (when we weren't busy with wedding events!). It's the perfect place for a wedding since there's different areas (upper lawn, main lawn, beach, etc) for ceremonies/cocktail hour/reception and you honestly can't get a better view.  While the villas is gorgeous and perfect (I mean, c'mon look at the photos?!), what really made our stay here was the staff. THEY ARE AMAZING. We booked through Luisa and all communication prior to the trip was",50,1081
" handled by her. Everything from planning our first meals, transportation, grocery service, golf carts, covid tests, etc. was handled so professionally. We are so glad we got to meet her when we arrived :) She then introduced us to Eduardo, who managed anything we needed during our stay. Anytime we needed more groceries (or tequila lol), Eduardo was on it. He was always there! And even if he wasn't, he made himself available or helped us coordinate late night beer runs! With all the wedding activities, our meals needed to be very flexible in terms of timing. The kitchen staff maneuvered around this incredibly and everything was DELICIOUS!! My only regret was not being around for all of the meals! We also had so much love for the cleaning staff. We were a party-heavy group and every morning I was amazed by the transformation back to a beautiful villa. We always felt safe with the 24 hour security, but you still have to be careful. Don't leave valuables out and be diligent about locking windows and doors... I was always appreciative that the staff helped keep things locked. And lastly, the gardeners were always out there keeping the grounds looking gorgeous.   Everything was beyond our wildest dreams and are so so grateful and appreciative of all the people who made this magical villa the experience of a lifetime. Everyone did an amazing job and made our wedding weekend better than we could have ever imagined.",30,1081

"I stayed at Villa del Oso for five days for my brother’s wedding which was held at the house. I typically don’t travel with jewelry but was assured that Sayulita was safe and brought some items for the various wedding events. The morning after the wedding my sister noticed her gold hoop earrings were missing from her room. We initially assumed she misplaced them but later she found cash and a Nintendo switch missing from her room too. None of those items were in the safe. I assumed I’d be OK since I did lock everything of value in the safe but when I went to look the safe was opened and I had two gold necklaces, a gold bracelet, an iPhone 12, and some cash stolen from the safe that was locked! They also took my luggage keys- not sure what they can do with those and it’s annoying",50,1081
" for me since the lock is integrated into the luggage and now I can’t lock it, and some leftover cash I had kept as a souvenir from a recent trip to Egypt (probably of no value in Mexico). We were staying in the two rooms upstairs in the main house.   Luisa was incredibly helpful and asked the staff to review the security footage and they found that two people came and turned the security cameras away from the rooms at 11:30pm and that’s likely when the theft occurred. Eduardo was also a huge help and took us to report the incident to the police on Monday (today) and helped with explaining the property layout and what he saw on the cameras and copying documents for us. Ironically I was very concerned about security while staying at a hotel before coming to the Villa but felt very safe there as they have cameras, security personnel, and heavy locks on most gates/doors. I think there was just a lot of activity/distraction the day of the wedding and that created an opportunity for some very brazen thieves. Just wanted people to be aware and take all the precautions you can!  Besides this incident the house and staff were awesome! It was great to spend time there with the bride and groom’s families before the wedding. Being right on the beach was great. The cooking service was so convenient and delicious. Luisa and Eduardo were friendly and so attentive and helpful. Such a beautiful property and the wedding was gorgeous and so much fun! I’d just stick to my gut next time and not bring anything of value. This unfortunate incident just shows that even in a very secure location thieves can find a way to get what they want. And if anyone finds Egyptian money in Sayulita let me know because I think we’d find the culprit :)",50,1081

I can’t say enough about our stay here. The pictures don’t do it justice. It is absolutely gorgeous with stunning views. Very clean and they made sure to help us keep it clean throughout our stay. We had a few meals there and I wish we had more. The food was wonderful and the staff was amazing.,50,1081
"14 of my best friends and I stayed at this beautiful property in Sayulita for 7 days.  The whole time we were there it felt like a dream. The home is perfectly situated on the hill with complete privacy , ping pong table, volleyball court, infinity pool and hot tub. We loved the house so much that we did not want to leave especially during sunset.  The interior of the house was just extravagant. The bathroom in our main room was the size of my apartment in states. If things couldn't get any better we were surrounded by the best staff anyone could ask for. The kitchen cook made best guacamole I personally had in my life. The whole stay was truly exceptional.   I stayed at many front beach homes in Sayulita and none of them can compare to Villa del oso",50,1081
"This was my 2nd time staying here and it's just amazing and was the perfect location for my wedding.  That's right girls, I'm married so back off!!!  More than enough room for the whole family and tons of space for activities.  It's right on the beach and the views are amazing.  All of our friends and family were amazed the moment they stepped foot on the property.  I cant see how anyone wouldn't want to have their wedding here.",50,1081
"I couldn’t decide how I felt about this place. The room was nice, and the bed was comfy. The pillows were awful, we got two more, and they were equally as bad. Lots of windows, I had fans were in the room. Under the bed was very dusty. I loved the bathrooms- outdoor, private, nice sinks, but the shower had NO pressure. If you have any hair at all, you won’t be able to rinse the soap out, let alone get your hair wet enough to lather any shampoo into it. There was no hot water, at all. The outdoor kitchen area is nice, clean, well appointed, but the fridge is really more like a plug in cooler that smells old and my things were either warm or frozen. There is no bbq, so don't think you can actually make any food. Plants are everywhere and the garden is lovely. The hammock and day",30,1082

There are chairs with that thick plastic tubing for seating that is so uncomfortable to sit in and leaves marks on your skin.  Jenna was really nice and accommodating- I accidentally locked myself out of my room, and while the housekeeper was there, she doesn’t have keys, so Flor contacted Jenna for me and 20 minutes later Jenna was opening my door, having left whatever she was doing to let me into my room.  It’s a very quick walk to town, so not bothered by the parties or bars, but there is plenty of construction that starts quite early and is noisy. Boogie boards to borrow and lots of space for storing your board.  It’s nice, but needs a bit of work, or an update to the website.",40,1082

The location was great - close enough to everything, yet far enough away to not be bothered by noise from the town square at night. Everything you need is within a one or two minute walk. I appreciated the privacy and the amenities offered and would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a great experience at an amazing price.",50,1082
"If you like to be close to the party without hearing it, this is the place to be :).  Close to the town center but far enough to sleep at night.  Best place to stay.  It's just a short walk from the center (5 min).  The roof top is very nice.  There is a hammock that is the most comfy ever...  The host are very nice and they make you feel like you are at home.  Believe me, you can't go wrong :D.",40,1082

I went on a solo surf trip to Sayulita to escape the New York City madness during Thanksgiving — all I wanted was a clean and quiet place to stay that was close enough to the downtown area and the beach break. Casa Buena Onda was all those things and more! My room was huge (I stayed at Camarone Room) with a lovely terrace and access to a little kitchenette, where I would make coffee and oatmeal every morning. The rooftop deck was my happy place after surf sessions, where I'd do yoga, crack a beer, nap and read. I basically had this beautiful dream home to myself! And besides the perfect location, Terry and Sheryl were absolutely amazing hosts — they were super caring and accommodating, but also gave you enough privacy. It",50,1082

I went out for breakfast and returned and they still didn't have it served. I would recommend putting out bread or something earlier.",40,1083
"Upon arrival, we had to wake up the front desk worker at 9:30am to speak in person about how we wanted to cancel our accommodation. I had previously attempted to contact the hostel via their official e-mail many days before the refund cut-off date but got no response. Once the staff reluctantly emerged from his room, he told me it would take a few days to get my refund. He explained that I had to cancel through the website I used to booked my stay on - which was the official Lush hostel website. The only contact info on the site is their official e-mail, which I attempted to get in contact with for weeks prior to this. The staff told me to send another e-mail (which I explained I had four times already) telling them why we wanted to cancel and that I would get my money back.   I",10,1083
" have filed a case for fraudulent charges with PayPal based on the fact I only spent 30 minutes in the building and was charged over $360.00CAD. Of course the hostel is not co-operating with PayPal so I am feeling like it's a lost cause.   I wasn't going to leave a negative review until I started receiving e-mails from the official Lush e-mail account (that had previously been ghosting me) begging me to leave one, so here it is. I only ever saw one person ever working there, and I saw him out and about around town during the day more than in his place of work. Granted he was a kind enough person, I still had a gut feeling that he wasn't going to do anything about my situation.  There was a rooftop bar, but it is permanently closed. After to speaking to a former employee that we had met in town, we were told that the hostel ""went downhill a while ago after everyone quit."" I highly recommend spending $10-$20 more per night and getting a proper hotel. The difference was night and day. Do not stay here.",10,1083

We had so much fun and loved the place so much, that we extended our stay numerous times and eventually ended up staying for a month! The hostel itself is very comfortable, with great facilities such as a pool and a really nice rooftop bar. There is a free cooked breakfast in the morning, including coffee. The dorms themselves are comfortable, with the options to choose between an 8 bed or 12 bed dorm. There are also nice private rooms. The place is really well run and we always felt very safe.

" going out on fun activities with them during the day and out to party with them at night.   The activities they run during the day are very varied and always loads of fun, such as jungle hikes to nearby beaches, trips to other towns and volleyball matches. At night, there is always a great atmosphere in the jostles bar, which is the best place in Sayulita to start your night out. Local DJs and bands play there on a regular basis and they have really good drink deals, like all you can drink Margaritas for 100 pesos!   All in all, Lush is an incredible hostel, the best I‘ve ever stayed in. If you are travelling to Sayulita it is the only play to stay.  Shoutout to the staff - Isa, Mario, Tessa, Lalo, Gaya, Ivan, Armando, Antoine and all the others who made our stay in Sayulita so memorable.",20,1083

"The recepcionist are all volunteers so they don't care anything, the room (8 people shared room )was a mess, the barhroom was SO dirty, it seems that the they haven't cleaned it in a long long time, and of course not hot water. In the time i was there they didnt even change the bag of  trash bin.. the breakfast was late  and poor, the dont care to improve it. and its really expensive for the service they give. To be fare, they should have a rate half of what they have or make a lot of improves. It just a constructive criticism. The best thing, the location.",50,1083
"Upon entering, the whole staff really didn't care that a guest entered the building. It rather seemed like they found my presence inconvenient. Without saying much, they talked to each other for a couple minuntes, pretty  much ignoring me, and ended up handing me a key and showing me the room.  The hostel is being cleaned every morning but looks gross after a couple hours (especially the bathroom). There was all sorts of stuff laying around, including peoples' underwear. Also, It's burning hot because there are only 2 fans for the whole dorm. When I wanted to have breakfast at 9:30am, absolutely nothing was ready and a hungover and tired volunteer joked 'how crazy unorganized this place is' and laughed about it. 20 Minutes later, he brought some eggs and toast and told me I",50,1083
"The room was clean and well kept but needs improvement. There's no door to the shower and the water is usually cold, which in December is not appreciated. Is hard to sleep due to the outside noises, especially dogs, cats and roosters, and some noisy neighbors that keep the party late. But the beds were comfy. The location is strange, on a dirty road but only 15 minutes walk to the town center. WiFi is hard to get, we had working WiFi after6 days into our stay. If you are very low maintenance, this is a good place.",20,1084
"We booked this place a bit last minute, as we were just in Sayulita over Thanksgiving with our kids. Returned to look at real estate, and found Meson Del Perro was available over NYE. The online presence is poor but hopefully Tripadvisor will put them on the map. It's located as you're coming into town but quite a walk if you want to head into town. We already knew we wanted a golf cart to get around, so no problem for us, but maybe others. The condos are only a few years old but could use some structural maintenance. There is a bell to ring for service when you arrive, as the owners live above the ""reception"" area, aka their kitchen. One of the new guests arriving today was very confused about what to do since there are no signs telling you to ring the bell for help. We checked",30,1084
We have been staying at Los Almendros for almost 10 years and just love it. The condos are quaint and fully equipped.  It is a short walk to town and to the beach.  The staff are very friendly and the pool is always clean.,50,1085
We absolutely loved staying here. The condo was beautiful and in a great location. It was quiet but still walking distance to anything you could need. The pool was the most amazing pool for kids! We will definitely be staying here again. The staff was great and helpful too.,50,1085
"We recently returned from Sayulita and another wonderful, relaxing stay at Los Almendros. We have stayed at a few other places in town, but Los Almendros consistently makes our vacation easy and enjoyable. I think this was our 8th stay here because it provides everything we could want: well maintained grounds and buildings, big pool, friendly staff, security, well-appointed condominium with amazing housekeepers in a very quiet part of town.",50,1085
"Beautiful place with a beautiful view. Lovely staff, very friendly and helpful. Perfect place for family or friends. If you like to listen to music, be sure to bring a Bluetooth speaker. Just remember you have neighbors so don't play it too loud.",50,1085
Everything was great with the stay. The location is great as it's close enough to the main strip and the beaches but far enough that noise isn't issue. The rooms and grounds were very clean and safe. Staff all super friendly. Wouldn't hesitate to book again.,50,1085
My family had an excellent time. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Our accommodations were more then what we expected. Very clean and never felt unsafe.  Beautiful area and would love to return again someday.,50,1085
"This is a residence, not a hotel. Well maintained, secure, and geared to quiet family retreat. The staff are extremely helpful and very pleasant. It felt like a community and we could not have found a nicer condo environment. It is close enough to walk for amenities and the beach. The kitchen is well equipped except for a tea kettle,but I have learned to travel with one through experience. Wifi is 10 by 10. I don't hesitate to recommend this property for your next visit to Sayulita. See you next year!",50,1085
The place was perfect to host several of our wedding invitees. Very spacious rooms and great amenities. Clean and well maintained. Very friendly staff. Great pool and common areas. We definitely recommend it.,50,1085
The rooms were spacious with king size beds in each room.  Patio off each room.  Nice jungle view. The bathrooms and kitchen were very clean.  It would have been nice to have a broom in the facility as sand was easy to track in on the floors. Maid service was excellent.,50,1085
"We were in Villa Heidi. Everything was perfect. Condo is well stocked for cleaning supplies, paper goods, and cooking equipment. So many times we've walked into a condo with a coffee maker and a washing machine with no coffee filters and no detergent. Here that was not the case. Visiting with other guests around the pool was also a bonus. Only negative was from our adult guests staying in the second bedroom. The twin beds are on wooden platforms and creak loudly when you move. Los Almendros is well located for a 10 min walk to beach and 15 min walk to town. Town is pretty lively so that is close enough for us.",50,1085
"Las instalaciones del lugar están bien, la vista de algunos cuartos está espectacular, asegúrate de cuando haces la reserva pedir uno con vista al mar, por que de lo contrarío te van a dar un cuarto sin vista y no vale la pena.  El restaurante tiene vista al mar, lo cual te da una calma y atmósfera envidiable, sin embargo la relación precio-calidad de la comida está fuera de la competencia, estoy de acuerdo que cobren lo justo por ser playa y el tipo de hotel, pero cuando te llega una comida que te deja mucho que desear te desilusiona mucho.  Lamentablemente tuve la mala suerte que durante mi estancia estaban cortos de perdonal, por qué el chef del restaurante era al mismo tiempo mi mesero y recepcionista, que aunque se esforzaba mucho, lamentablemente la experiencia en tiempos,",20,1086
" servicio y atención fue muy pobre.  Si estás buscando un hotel con playa a la orilla, está no es tu opción, la playa está a varios kilómetros en terracería donde pasan los vehículos y después te tienes que meter a una brecha de selva de 200 metros para poder llegar a la playa, si no te incomoda hacer esta travesía, créeme que será reconfortante por que la playa está espectacular.  Por último el administrador del hotel el Sr. Ignacio que se dice ser el hijo de la dueña, te da un trato poco colaborativo al grado de acoso, donde según el todo está bien y si no te gusta, tu eres el que estás mal. Podría decir que da un trato con mucha soberbia en especial al turista mexicano.  Exploraría otras opciones antes de volver a ir de nuevo al mismo hotel.",50,1086

Tiene una Excelente Ubicación, a unas cuentas cuadras de la terminal y muy cerca de la plaza de Sayulita, con muchos puestos de comida alrededor, en las tardes justo enfrente venden comida. Llegamos como 25 min antes y el check in es a las 3:00pm, tuvimos que esperar sentados en una banquita con techito sudados y un poco cansados, en ese aspecto no tuvieron consideración, pero bueno se entiende que NO es un hotel.  Te explican las indicaciones al darte la habitación y tu llave, tienen una pequeña alberca en la parte de atrás que cuenta con horario.  La habitación pintoresca cuenta con lo básico necesario, mini refri, ventilador de techo, aire acondicionado,",30,1087

No hay estacionamiento. La Zona se veía segura y tranquila, en ese aspecto no tuvimos problemas por el ruido. En pocas palabras si recibes por lo que pagas.  Solo estuvimos de paso en Sayulita, es pequeño.  Recomendable para estancias cortas.",30,1087
"I took two yoga classes here, with Ita and Adrian, and they were both the best classes I've ever taken. Both instructors gave their all and incorporated asanas and techniques I've never encountered in 20+ years of yoga. I also did a by-donation sound healing with Adrian and was so moved. The facility is one out of my dreams -- airy outdoor studio in the trees where roosters and tropical birds provide the soundtrack. If I come to stay for a long period I will definitely spend a lot of time here.   The only drawback was that the person working the desk couldn't provide any info to my cousin about the surf lessons and the owner never bothered to return her message, simply telling the staff to tell her all the info was on the website. Well, it wasn't, or my cousin would not have",50,1088

I’m new to yoga and decided to get a month membership while in Sayulita. I had the best experience here. All the teachers are amazing and very skilled. Being new I felt shy going in but the instructors made all levels feel welcome. I even took Jason’s power yoga class a few times and got my butt kicked but in a good way. I would highly recommend taking a class or 10 while in Sayulita. I now feel way more confident in my yoga skills and will miss this piece of heaven.,50,1088
This is a beautiful space with the main yoga area upstairs amongst the trees. It’s peaceful (despite the roosters) and the teachers are amazing. I left my earrings after class and left a note for them to call me if they were found. They sent me a WhatsApp message within the hour of dropping off the note and I picked them up the next day. My good friend did YTT here was well and loved it.,50,1088
"Studio mágico! I have been coming to this studio for years. Sometimes solo, sometimes with my husband and/or daughter. The enchanted garden leads to a breezy palapa. Many different styles of yoga are explored here - I’ve never had a teacher that didn’t provide a fantastic experience. A very special place built with care and love in the Sayulita spirit.",50,1088
"Wonderful place, the most beautiful peaceful garden! Great yoga area with awesome yoga classes, a great variation and fully equipped. Paraiso yoga is just a lovely oasis, that feels calm and its also close to the beach and close to the centre!!",50,1088
"While I was visiting Sayulita in Feb I had wonderful experiences with full hearted yoga teachers Tanya and Henry! They brought fun and light hearted elements to class and as a yoga teacher, I even learned a few new tricks from them! They were very attentive to the students and even offered some classes in both English and Spanish! Thank you both Tanya and Henry!! ",50,1088
"My friend and I took a morning Vinyasa class at Paraiso and absolutely loved it. The space is beautiful, and the teacher was very knowledgeable and kind. I can't wait to go again on my next visit to sayulita",50,1088
We had Enrique from Paraiso Yoga come to our villa for a private yoga class. It exceeded our expectations. Enrique taught a very thoughtful class that was both challenging and encouraging. Nara was also very communicative and accommodating during the process. I highly recommend this studio and their instructors. Thank you for the unique experience and a great way to start off our trip in Sayulita!,50,1088
"First, I have to state that the staff are nice. That’s about it for the pros.  This was our worst hotel experience ever (if you can call that place an hotel). I’m shocked I booked it.  We have booked two rooms. One for the kids and one for us. The kids room had no washroom and they were expected to use a common one. We immediately upgraded to a “normal” room.   The “normal” rooms looked like monastery rooms with terrible facilities, old beds with old covers, leaking shower, we had to ask someone to get hot water, wifi that goes down every minute. I can’t really describe it with words. It was just awful, and we are not a spoiled family. This place is not by any standard and is not qualified as humans accommodations during a vacation.  Also, the pool was dirty with too much",10,1089
" chlorine.  Although the location is good for the day and evening, it is crazy noisy at night. The music from the nearby bar didn’t stop until 4 am (like sleeping in a bar) after that came the roosters which were unbearable even with ear plugs (like sleeping in a barn). It was a nightmare. We all didn’t sleep the whole night.  We came for one night and wanted to spend the 2nd day on the beach but were too exhausted to stay and just took the bus back to PV to our condo.   Learn from our experience, do yourself a favour and just stay away.",40,1089

It was New Years week and there weren't a lot of options checking into a private room from a hostel. Luckily we found David and Hotel Las Graditas. Great location in town and had everything you need. We were budget travelers and got a great deal on our room as well as such helpful accommodations from the staff. Would definitely stay there again. Great views from the pool.,30,1089
"Un increíble hotel boutique con un diseño impecable. Desde el dinamismo de los balcones en fachada, el lobby a doble altura, los acabados en concreto crudo, alternados con maderas cálidas y un excelente gusto para el mobiliario e iluminación. Un roof top con alberca, camastros y un bar increíble. Caminando de la playa, el centro y absolutamente todo lo que hay que hacer en Sayulita. Super recomendado. ",50,1090
"Absolutely wonderful stay. perfect spot, a quick 5 min walk to town but away from all the noise. The place was very clean, staff was so friendly. The rooftop pool was the perfect relaxing luxurious spot !! They have cold, clean filtered water on each floor which was super helpful. Thank you to the Ximena team!",50,1090
"Excelente opción para hospedarse, la atención, el servicio del personal es increíble!! Las decoración y las instalaciones completamente nuevas, el área de la alberca está muy padre y privada. Yassem y Eker excelentes anfitriones!! Súper recomendación!!",50,1090
I booked three rooms for a night and they were all great. The location is right on the beach in the main area of Sayulita. I'd definitely book here again. The view from our room was incredible. Waking up and seeing the ocean is one of my favourite things in the world!,50,1091
"I'm truly sad to write this review, as there are some great things to love about Casa Love. Xiomara who greeted us and the two women who come to clean each day are very sweet and helpful! The view from our room, Reina, was beautiful. We could wake up in the morning and watch the surfers, and watch the clouds change color in the evenings. We had a comfy couch on our patio and a hammock inside the room, so plenty of places to lounge. Also, there was hot water, contrary to another review on here. The bathrooms were roomy and functional. The hotel also provided beach towels, which is a nice touch.  The common room is also very nice - lots of places to hang out, and a kitchen that's fairly well stocked (although almost no spoons, which was sort of weird). The wifi was also really",20,1091
" good!  The negatives: There is no full-time front desk. This isn't a huge deal, but if you're someone who is going to have lots of questions, etc., this probably isn't the place for you. Also, make sure you email or be in touch with the staff in advance of your visit - there is a code to get in off the street and no other way to enter once you arrive. Also no guarantee staff will be there at the time you arrive.  The place had a bit of a hostel vibe - which is to say, folks would hang out in the common room drinking and leave the place dirty for the morning (and, I guess, expect the cleaning women to pick up after them). The fridge, which is nice to have, was also full of what seemed like old food and just need a good clean out.   However, the biggest problem was definitely the noise. The rooms are open air, which is generally nice but Sayulita is a LOUD town with several different bars around the area that blast music until as late as 3 am. There was also one night that the restaurant across the street was doing construction until maybe 11pm. The hotel can't help these things, but it was just really hard to sleep. Maybe a great place for you if you are one who is out at the bars until the music goes off. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",50,1091

"I absolutely LOVE staying at Casa Love or Pachamama as the head locals seem to call it whenever I'm in town. First of all the location is unprecedented - right off the beach, beside the best locs spot Aloha for chill eats & drinks, easy stroll to the plaza at night plus the nicest family owners you cold imagine. I always feel so welcome here in this beautiful artsy eclectic casa - I would give Casa Love Pachamama all of the stars in the sky if i could .... lucky they are easily stolen after Sayulita sunset instead - go enjoy a magic experience! Everything here is off the charts xxxxx",10,1091
"The good: Casa Love is literally one building away from the beach, right on the Main Street off the town square. The views are beautiful and the place is very well decorated.   The bad: After finding Casa Love and booking it, I had a few questions about the hotel, and the town. My emails were never answered. Phone calls had the same fate. When we got there, the guy who showed us to the room was either drunk or high. Not a professional look at all. Customer service was non-existent as we came and went without being greeted during our whole stay.   The iffy: The rooms are open, and it’s a cool concept. But as we found out, the same concept contains very little. if you have “loud” neighbors, you may be greeted with amorous sounds at some point during your stay. Not kid-friendly. ",50,1091
"I stayed at this hostel from March 7-13, 2022 as a solo traveler in the 4 bed dorm. It was comforting to stay in an all-female hostel and having the support of other women during my stay.  The dorm was a separate room off of the main 8 bed dorm. It was quiet and the bed was comfortable. There are lockers with keys provided in the room for your valuables. There is a fan in the room but no A/C, which was fine with me, as it typically cooled off during the night. There were three showers and three washrooms and I never had an issue accessing any of them during my stay. The water in the shower was never hot but it was usually lukewarm or cooler.  The hostel was small and intimate and I loved the decor and vibe. It was very relaxed and not a party hostel. I also liked the location as",50,1092
" it was situated on a main street in a quieter area of town about 5 minutes walk from the centre of town where all of the bars and restaurants are. The hostel had a nice patio on the main floor overlooking the street with a couch, tables and swings and a small kitchen area and fridge. There was also a rooftop patio where events and yoga classes took place and it was a nice spot to relax in the sun as well. I loved the tropical trees overlooking the deck and on the stairway going up to the deck.  The Wi-Fi was on and off and worked well in the mornings when not a lot of people were using it, but sometimes really slowed down in the evenings.  The staff and other ladies were friendly and welcoming. I attended one morning yin yoga class and it was lovely and very relaxing. All of the yoga classes are by donation and anyone can attend. In terms of security, there is a gate at the hostel entrance with a code given to guests (the gate locks from after 6 pm until the morning).  Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this hostel and really liked the relaxing vibe and being around other women. It felt like a very safe space and I would definitely stay here again.",50,1092
"I booked an 'apartment' in this block through Air BnB and on arrival was shown a room far inferior to that which had been shown on the listing photos. The property on the listing had separate kitchen and sofa seating areas and outside space with table and chairs. The property I was shown was a small dark bedroom with a kitchen unit along one wall - no separate sitting or kitchen space, no balcony or outside space. I pointed this out to the guy on site who spoke no English and he indicated I should contact Brian at the property company (the Air BnB host).   I suggested a call with Brian but he refused and instead we communicated through the message function on Air BnB (thankfully this meant I had conversation recorded). He suggested the problem was with me and I 'did not like'",10,1093
" the room, I pointed out to him, that was nothing to do with it, the simple fact was it was a completely different and far inferior property to that shown on the listing. He then tried to find me an alternative in his property portfolio - it was a room in a different building but again only one room with kitchen unit, no separate space, so I said it was not what I had booked and would need to look elsewhere.   At this point I realised I was dealing with someone dodgy and tried to ask the guy on reception to let me back up to the room to take photos as evidence. He either didn't understand or just refused, which meant I could not take photos.  I asked Brian for a refund as the room was not as shown (false advertising), which he refused. I then had to quickly book alternative accommodation in Sayulita for the duration of my stay. The cancelation refund was then escalated to Air BnB who investigated and refunded me after a few stressful days of back and forth.   The host Brian has since left a very unprofessional Air BnB review with lots of false information which I have picked up with Air BnB to get removed.  A thoroughly stressful and unpleasant experience. This guy is a conman. Avoid at all costs.",10,1093

After 2 hours of discussing they provided me with the room which was humid, dirty and had a small bed although we had booked a Queen Size. Next to the room there was a common area w kitchen (dirty!!). At 9:30pm a group of 6 drunk people started to cook, scream and put their music on maximum volume.

The rooms are great! Well equipped with kitchen (big fridge), TV, SUPER COMFY bed and warm water. The pool area is just what you need to relax, and the warm jacuzzi is just what you need when you come back from surfing. Don´t forget to try the chilaquiles for breakfast! Special thanks to Martin and all the staff for the wonderful hospitality.",50,1094
Big thanks to martin and his staff for making my stay at ballena comfortable -  Idyllic setting near enough to the centre of all but far enough to be able to totally relax.  Breakfast was a nice touch (unusual in most Mexico properties) and the whole place spotlessly clean.  But for me the music that they play around the pool area was the best bit - never had to use my headphones once such was the quality of the playlists.  Will be back .... soon hopefully! ;)  ,50,1094

"I really DON'T want to leave this place a good review because I want to keep it all to myself... this place was exactly what we wanted! Perfect walking distance to downtown-maybe 3-4 minutes. But yet far enough away from all the noise and craziness. Beautiful tranquil pool and small property so that it's never too crowded. Martin and his two dogs are the best and the small gym on the property was all I needed for my morning workouts. The rooms are AMAZING and come equipped with full kitchenettes so we stocked up on snacks and drinks on our way into town. Also breakfast was included and I dare you to find a better breakfast anywhere! I had the chilaquiles every day. wonderful staff, excellent property. Don't stay here ;)",50,1094
"We had the pleasure of staying here recently and we already want to go back. This place is quite a find. We were here for a family wedding, with guests staying all over Sayulita and everyone that saw our place wanted to come stay here. It is a small group of rooms (maybe 9 or 10?), so it is very intimate, while also spacious. The rooms are huge and beautiful with modern concrete floors, complete little kitchenettes and a beautiful bathroom. The pool and jacuzzi in the center of the courtyard was perfect. Martin, who is the property manager was there for anything and everything we needed. The free breakfast everyday was an added bonus. Defintely consider this for your stay in Sayulita, and we are lucky enough to come back we will definitely be staying here.",50,1094

Our shower was having draining problems and we didn't have hot water. We alerted him to the fact that our shower was flooding our hotel room and we had no hot water, and he acted so annoyed that we woke him up at midnight. He told us the shower is not intended to be used for a long time, and there is only a limited amount of hot water per room. There wasn't even enough hot water for one person to take a shower.We had also asked for the hot tub to be turned on, which is an amenity listed on the property. They will only turn it on when you ask them to, and it cant be when they are asleep. They seem to be more",20,1094
" concerned with money than making guests stay comfortable. It was MLK weekend and Sayulita was packed, and we were the only guests of the hotel for the entire long weekend. They treated us like they were bothered they had to work for our stay. They constantly acted annoyed with every request we had. We had 1 guest come back to the property at 5pm, for sunset, and the guest didn't know that there was a no smoking policy. Instead of politely asking the guest to go outside, they yelled at him. They were very disrespectful. I always recommend this property to my friends that travel to Sayulita. I would NEVER recommend this property again based on how we were treated. You can find properties that are price equivalent in Sayulita, and I am certain that they will not treat you like you are annoying them for asking to use the hotel amenities.",50,1094

"This place is awesome, 2 blocks from the beach, tons of stuff around it. the courtyard is beautiful great place to enjoy your meal and have a few bottles. There is a shared kitchen, and shared refrigerator if you want to cook and be healthy. I stayed in a private room, which was perfect, had a bed and a bathroom and a shelf. All you need. The staff is great and friendly and attentive. I stayed there for 9 days and couldn't have been happier. ",50,1095
Please try your best to speak a few polite words in Spanish. These guys will watch your back.. great kitchen too. i slept in the large dorm in the back. Much cooler than the smaller front rooms.  Clean bunks. 6 burner gas stove. Professional firidge. Shop in the local markets to have dinner and invite the folks who work there to join you for a meal. it goes a long way. Everyone speaks spanish. No frat kids please. They seem to piss off the workers if you come home and make noise.. haha Enjoy,40,1095
"We stayed at Lola for 3 nights before we moved into a house with friends. The staff was ok. They were able to help when our key was left overnight at a surf shop. The online reservation system did not work well. I think we booked via priceline and nobody had any idea where our reservation was. This ended up being very confusing even knowing decent spanish. If you don't know much spanish then good luck to you. We got a private room and it was pretty basic. It had a couch, bed, bath. The room was pretty big and had a fan however did not have a mosquito net. I would have felt a lot better having a mosquito net considering the walls were open air and huge gaps underneath the door. We also found a fair amount of wildlife in our room. This included a decent sized scorpion on the",20,1095
 bathroom door and at least 5 real big cockroaches in the room at all times no matter how many we killed. After finding the scorpion I would have slept a lot better with a mosquito net. The bathroom was pretty old and used up. I don't think dirty is fair but I have seen better. I guess the bottom line is for $55 dollars a night I would expect more.,50,1095

"Wow.... This place is FANTASTIC!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 weeks and had the best time. Rodolfito, Alejandro and Paula were the nicest people ever. We went on a boat trip with Rodolfito and Paula to the Marieta Islands and it was wonderful. The rooms are clean and really spacious. We especially liked the smoothies and food you can purchase, it's all fresh and very good value it was lovely to be able to have breakfast and chill before going about the day.  The location of Lola is perfect, it's about 2 mins walk from the bus station so very convenient if your busing it from the airport which we did as it's only 35pesos which is about £1.60. Your also only 5 mins from the beach and the square here where you can enjoy surfing, great food and meet wonderful people.  I'd",30,1095
" recommend taking the bus to San Pancho too, it's only 15 mins from sayulita and costs 15 pesos, it's a great little place with a gorgeous beach. If you skate there is a small mini ramp too. We loved our time in Sayulita there is so much to do and explore and a beach you can reach by walking through the jungle for 15 mins, this beach never has people on it so take a picnic and a cool box and enjoy the privacy and beauty.

"Amaia Boutique Hotel has the perfect location in Sayulita - right in the main square and less than 2 min walk from the beach.  The receptionist was incredibly sweet and friendly, we were treated with so much care and kindness. The hotel is beautiful, with a lush garden and a small heated pool, so nice! Our room was lovely and the bedsheets were the softest we have ever slept in. We also loved the smell of the conditioner. Thank you Amaia for a beautiful welcome and a great stay.",50,1096
"The hotel is directly underneath the Amaia club which blasts music past 3 am most nights. Sometimes people were directly above us, talking loudly, until 5 am. Even when the Amaia club was not open, nearby clubs would play music till 3 am, making it very difficult to sleep (even with earplugs/headphones). Even if you could drown out the noise, the bed would be vibrating from the music. This was not mentioned on the website. The hot water in the shower would only last for a few minutes at a time, becoming lukewarm but hot again if you left it running. The water pressure was not great. There are no windows in the rooms. Two of the rooms are connected to the reception area (people always talking outside your door) and not the cute little courtyard.",10,1096
Hotel had no water for toilet or shower. We were booked for 4 nights but first night we had no water . We would have chalked it up to a temporary problem but other guests said they had no water 3 nights in a row. Two other rooms checked out in addition to us. Hotel refused to refund our payment for the 3 nights we had to stay elsewhere,10,1096
"Rooms right under a club with very very load music playing everyday  - impossible to sleep until the club closes at 4:00. No windows, stuffy and humid air. No refunds. Very central constant car traffic. Charming staff.",10,1096

"This resort has everything that is described.  Boutique/Prime Location/Clean/Strong Wi-fi/Cold AC/Perfect for Couples or Solo travelers.  You'll love it!  It was the service that surprised me and exceeded my expectations.  Joaquin stepped up to help me out without hesitation.  He didn't have to but was eager to assist.  He made several phone calls, translated, and worked to troubleshoot my unique situation.  I couldn't have done it without his help.  Hope to make it back soon.",50,1096
"My husband and I took a weekend trip to Sayulita and stayed at Junto al Rio in one of the beachfront palapas, Mangle 2, which I would recommend. It is nothing fancy, but nicely appointed and very relaxing with the sound of the ocean waves crashing throughout the night. The facilities on site were great, too. La Isla bar offers delicious food and drinks served by very cool waiters and bartenders. We also had breakfast at the little restaurant staffed by the hippest Mexican kids in town, and in addition to amazing huevos rancheros, we got to play with puppies and a bunny. We recommend Junto al Rio for the warm service, the accommodations, and the location - easy walk to the center of town, but far enough away from the noise.",40,1097
We had a wonderful Stay at Junto Al Rio-The room which are basically Ovean Front Where very comfortable-Cleaned daily and the shower was always as Hot as required. The little basic Kitchenette was adequate for our needs of Breakfast and the odd home cooked Mahi mahi Dinner to the Fridge that worked great to keep our Beverages. The Restaurant out front which is part of Junto but open to the public as well is True Oceanfront and the service and the food was Excellent-Moses and Jenny and all the others looked after us extremely well! -Thanks to all of ya--Always there was purified water available for us to take to our rooms 24/7/ The beach was First calls and you could walk a long ways-Top oit off we had Perfect weather-26-28 and sunny everyday for 2 weeks-Highly recommend this Spot,50,1097
"For all future travelers, I personally did have a great experience as it's written from past guests at this location, yes location is right on the beach. Which is the only positive and staff members were ok, but they also withold information act as they don't know. Upon arrival a young man Marcus made us sign a waiver stating they're not resposible for anything and everything that belongs to you (this includes your personal belongings the hotel or your rental car that allows to park, they are 0% responsible should anything happen, its their resposility to disclose such terms at time of booking on their end. Marcus walked us to where we'd be staying and try to show the safe box functions execpt was non-functional, he said would send someone to fix it next day (never happened) we",10,1097
" were forced to carry all of our valuables at all times, since their waiver stated wouldn't guarantee to keep any of our belongings safe.  Puerto Vallarta is knowingly humid, in which we expected to have proper ventilate and screens outside etc. to keep the bugs and rodents outside. This was not the case the door & windows are made of bamboo which you are expose to noise and creepy things crawling in, (never read any of this information on their end) we only had one ceiling fan to cool the entire room, did not keep us cool! This is not a place for small children, anyone can or could simply walk into room, they don't have much of a lock. The absolute worst thing was the following: WARNING: don't ask for transportation at all, I was scam by getting a fare fee for 4-5 times higher than the normal fee of $500-$600 pesos one way from airport to location or vs. Just take uber or taxi, I got taken advantage for a total $2625 equals approx $130-140 US DLS, Beds absolute hard as rocks, No A/C. The icing on the cake was the massive roaches, had be so on edge throught the nights, woke up with some under my sheets, was so awful, brought this to their attention and got an ignorant response, (ok will see how we can do that after suggested they need screen protection) as we were walking to our room one night we ecnounter a large rotten (RAT) next to the beach there a river where water end up on the beach, unfortunately they discard trash and that goes righ into the ocean, this establishment needs to take resposibitlity to be able to manage issue, they don't charge cheap.  Last, they offer a restaurant/bar but not for me becuase all people who stay here are smokers and was not a great experience having a meal. Stayed 3 nights were the most stressful ruin my vacation and did not rest. Next time skip the jungle theme and get a indoor with pool and A/C was not worth location on the beach.",50,1097

"After reading a few negative reviews I was actually surprised to read them.  I love this place.  The staff is very friendly both the women at the front desk and the guy who does the afternoon and the Wednesday shift (on her day off).  They are both very professional and on point.  They are very straight forward about the price and fair.  JP one of the servers at the bar we had for a few days was also very professional and friendly.  Everything about this place is to love.  I like the grounds as well.  Everything is well kept and swept up in the morning.  It’s rustic but you know what you are getting so those who have negative reviews don’t travel and understand the idea of bungalow.  Anyways,  I was happy with everything about this place.

"We booked this place based on the photos - we should have read the reviews.  When arriving we were greeted with an overwhelming stench of sewage.  We were told that a pipe had recently broken, but from looking at these reviews the same stench is noted back in 2017.  Not exactly recent.  The woman who checked us in was not at all welcoming and made us feel that we were interrupting her day.  Wifi did not work and we were given no answer as to why, just ""it's off"".  The room was FILTHY with sand on the floor, thick cobwebs on the ceiling and stained towels.  Every time we opened the windows we were overwhelmed again by the sewage smell so we had to keep them closed.  The bar staff was just as unpleasant as the reception, ignoring us completely while we tried to enjoy the",30,1097

"We never felt safe in this property, I was suspicious that they looked (or even tried) into my clothes and personal things.  It is terrible not to be able to trust the place you stay when you are looking for relaxing vacations. Zero problem solving.  Also, the staff never used masks or any other safety measure, they just smiled and did nothing.  Do not stay here!",10,1098
"I always research hotels before booking.  Being an experienced traveler, I understand the importance of having a relaxing hotel as your sanctuary to rest up for your next adventure.  Oz Hotel in Suyalita is superb.  Excellent location.  It is on Revolution avenue just a minutes walk from the center of town.  It's steps away from highly rated restaurants like Alquimista (best breakfast) and Aaleyah's (best shrimp tacos).  It's about a 15 minute walk to Playa De Los Muertos.  Well worth the trek.  It even has an urgent care style facility across the street to get your COVID test done before returning back to the states.",50,1098
"The clients of my travel agency stayed only 3 nights in this inn-hotel and found it strange that some employees were in front of the doors of some rooms, in the hotel corridors. On the last day, when they went out for a walk, they decided to return right away to get more money from the safe box and saw an employee in front of their room, and then another one leaving the room, saying they were tidying up; when they opened the safe there was USD 220.00 missing, that is: employees had access to the hotel safe box with a Master password. My clients complained to the hotel manager, who said he would investigate, but his response was to offer 2 nights as a gift for future use as compensation, knowing that the guests would never return to Puerto Vallarta.

"Stayed in a double hotel room. All was up to standard and service was excellent. We had to ask for additional towels as only two were provided and we were a family of 4, and they were brought to us immediately.

It was really discouraging on the check out staff did not give back deposit! It makes one wonder how many visitors had been cheated like this.   When I called back to retreated the deposited - the person was not proactive to offer the solution and only said someone will call back.  Ono one did! I would strongly discourage foe people to stay there.,10,1099
Really sorry to have stayed here and become a bother to one particular blonde who felt that I was acting as the most important person. Honestly I was thankful for the help to get connected with my work online. The one staff was unfriendly and self-centered most concerned with her task that did fine after my insisting to turn on the AC with so many computers and peripherals running in the tiny office at the entrance. WiFi wasn’t possible but a wired connection was necessary for the video conference for work. Other staff were friendly and helpful.,10,1099

Even though everything is hand written and all the other notes said others gave deposits, because he forgot to write down that I gave a deposit they refused to give me one.   Other minuses: My bedroom window curtains didn’t shut all the way and were pretty see thru so all night I was afraid someone could look inside me room.

Staff were amazing, Salvador was such a help! The pool was great, breakfast was included and there was also a little kitchen in my room. Own private bathroom and hot water.

The rooms were comfortable with great AC and convenient for cooking in the kitchen. The roof top pool was an amazing place to hang out. The pool is heated and  the water inviting to go for a swim day or night. Lots of chaise lounge chairs to relax plus a pizza cooking oven on a higher roof top deck we used to make some baguettes. The staff was friendly with smiles on their faces and very helpful. Marisa the owner was also very helpful, warm and friendly. We met other guest as well which was a bonus.

"Great new property outside of the downtown area, on a hill about a 5 minute walk away. The rooms are simple yet functional, and everything worked. The actual bedroom area is on the smaller side, but I can't imagine travelling to Sayulita just to sit in your room all day. It was really nice to have a full fridge and a functioning kitchen. Good water pressure in the shower. AC worked very well. Pool area and terraces have great views.   We were fortunate to have the entire property to ourselves and were provided with excellent service from the staff, who we could contact at any time via WhatsApp.  They texted us on our day of arrival to verify our arrival time and indicated that we could contact them with any questions or requests.  We will definitely stay here again for future",50,1100

If you love to eat tacos, surf and have a few drinks this is a great place. I would come back for sure.",50,1101

You will be after you sleep on their incredibly firm and comfortable mattress. Beach chairs provided by the hotel. I’ve heard the restaurant is fantastic. And the location ?

The folding door on the balcony was missing hardware so it didn’t lock. Big bathroom and closet area which was good, but no coffee maker. The walk is long, unless you have a car or rent a golf cart from the resort for 1200 pesos per day. The people running the place are very nice and it feels like the are trying.

Unfortunately this was absolutely not true, the room had no proper balcony monks and was in a run down condition. They just have been super respectless.

After two weeks, the money was still not on my account, after countless Whats App messages; mails and phone calls I got a partial amount back and they told me they would not transfer the rest, because that would be the Booking.com fee.

Conveniently, there was no camera with a view of the far side of the property leaving the Master Suite completely vulnerable to entry via the balcony.

I would also like to believe that no other",50,1102
" members of staff had conspired with the rats, but only the police report and phone records will tell us for sure.

Sadly, I now appreciate that many of the other sub-par reviews on Google were accurate and that Customer Service, menu options, and management are mostly lacking. I will repeat what others have said, I really wanted to love this place! The views are very good, and the bungalos are comfortable. However, guest secuirty and safety should be the priority, and I cannot recommend anyone stay at Siete Lunas and specifically the Master Suite until the rat problem is fixed.

The chef (Manuel) and Tere made us delicious authentic meals, while Lucy and Yadira",10,1102
"The only complaint is that we didn’t stay longer! We loved everything about this place. The decor, the location, everything was amazing! Aaron was super responsive and made our trip that much better. It’s a short walk to everywhere you need to go.  We will definitely be back!",50,1104
"All the reviews for this place are 100% accurate.   Aaron was a very helpful and responsive host.   Cannot beat the location.   Even tho the town was bustling and busy, the unit could be sealed tight so no outside noise came in.  Add the black out blinds and the result was an epic nights sleep.   Furniture was cozy.  Place was very clean. Kitchen was stocked.   Pool and our patio was amazing.   The YahYah cafe was conveniently located right out front so great breakfast awaited us every morning.   We stayed in a couple other places on this trip and everything squeaked or wobbled or rattled or leaked.  But Casa Makawe was properly maintained.  We very much appreciated how whisper quiet it could get.",50,1104
"Casa Makawe was excellent. Comfortable, quiet, yet only a couple minutes walk from the square. The units facing the street (larger units) are on each floor separated from one another by a hallway, so no adjacent walls. Also, Aaron the manager/contact person was always responsive to questions, communicated clearly, and great to work with (especially nice if it's your first time to Salulita).   Full recommendation!",50,1104
"We loved our time at Casa Makawe! Aaron and the team were very accommodating and made sure we had a great stay. We stayed in one of the Queen Studios for the first part of our stay and loved the simplicity of the room and added kitchen area for making coffee, breakfast, etc. The room was a little dark, but it was one of the ones facing the back and on the plus side was incredibly quiet even though we were there over the busy and loud New Years holiday. We extended our stay and moved to one of the King Studios and loved it! Nice and bright with 2 patios, a huge kitchen, and a great sitting area. Also loved the rooftop pool and close location to town. !Muchisimas gracias Casa Makawe!",50,1104
"We had the top floor lofted apartment at Casa Makawe and we loved it. The loft is approx 850 sf with 180 degree views of the town and hills of sayulita, private balconies and an indoor / outdoor vibe with sliding doors that open up all the way. We both worked from the apartment and didn't feel like we were missing out on anything because the apartment gave us incredible light, bird song, views, and breezes. The wifi is excellent - no issues and easy to do any type of downloads etc. The rooftop infinity pool was a perfect end of day respite after a day at the beach or exploring town.  Aaron is a responsive and accommodating host and we highly recommend Casa Makawe.",50,1104
"We stayed at CasaMakawe for a full month and couldn’t be happier. My partner and I had been traveling for a couple months, and casamakawe was the perfect place to enjoy sayulita and soak up Mexico. Modern vibes, great room, roof top and pool vibes- we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. 10/10",50,1104
"We spent 5 days at casa makawe, and enjoyed every minute! The rooms are very comfortable with everything you would need.  It has a great location, under 5 minutes walk to get anywhere but it is just far enough to not hear all the amazing party spots bumpin at night. The pool was wonderful to relax in during the day and the bar had many games to play with other members staying in the building!  Highly recommend staying here! Aaron was a great host!",50,1104
"Perfect location just a short walk to the town which has many restaurants and bars. The rooms are modern with working and effective air conditioning. The kitchenette is well equipped should you wish to do some cooking of your own. Parking is available but limited. At the time of our visit the parking area was under construction. Should be available soon. Host is very friendly, speaks English and is always available. Rooftop pool is very inviting overlooking the town. Perfect for that evening sundowner. There is no cleaning service but I'm sure this could be arranged with the host.",50,1104
"A modern, newly built place. Super clean and spacious. Great location, a 5 minute walk to the main square or to the beach, yet far away enough from the noise of the bars.  Room had  a nice king size bed and Large shower which was nice after a day at the Beach.  Air conditioner worked great and the hammock in the room was a nice touch. Enjoyed the balcony in the evening before heading out. I would definitely stay here  again. ",50,1104
Aaron was very responsive and quick to reply to any questions we had. The roof top pool is a great lounging area. Location is perfect for access to beaches and the activity of town. Nice modern units with fully equipped kitchen. Note there is no oven. Gas cook top only. Filtered water as well.,50,1104
"This is not a fancy hotel but is quite adequate although you want a room with a view of the square. The location is excellent, rooms are clean, and it is a good value. Just what I expected.  The restaurant is good but we ate at lots of different places. We really like this small town",50,1105
"Hotel Tajin is conveniently located, right off the square and near the church courtyard where the voladores perform.   We stayed in the cheapest room on the main floor (which may have been a mistake) for 2 nights. King sized comfortable bed, AC, 1 bottle of water provided per day, lots of hot water, good wifi. The room showed lots of wear and tear, felt very humid  and was in need of an update. Being an old room, power outlets we high on the wall, making it difficult to charge our phone.  There must be nicer rooms because their pool area is beautiful!   There is a restaurant attached to the pool with very good food, La Parrochia. We much preferred it to the restaurant within the hotel.",30,1105
"The price didn't suggest luxury but the Tajin was very satisfactory with a comfortable, spacious room.  My room, being at the front of the building, offered a considerable view of the street life, with a distant view of a traditional ceremony (although the voladores might be out of reach).  The hotel staff were courteous.  Breakfast was not included in the price but what was available was more than enough; dinners were decent too.  With a small choice of accommodation in Papantla, I see no reason to stay anywhere else.",40,1105
"If you are looking for a clean, friendly hotel, with comfortable beds and a great location,  you have come to the right place!  This is not a hotel for people who expect first class accommodations.  There is no elevator (although there are people to carry your bags, if necessary), and the rooms have no safe, nor are the furnishings elegant, but this is a very clean, relaxing, pleasant place to relax after a day seeing the sights of Tajin and the darling town of Papantla.  There are verandas on each floor, a swimming pool, air conditioning, restaurants, and most everything you really need to unwind.  I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely return, especially at the low price charged for accommodations and the fact that it is right near the center of town.",40,1105
"20°26'45.66""N  97°19'15.80""W  To start with, you have to go up a flight of stairs to enter the hotel. With a heavy suitcase, this is not the best of situation.  However, once inside, you are greeted by a nice receptionist.  Normal time to get a room is 15:00. I got there at 13:30 and got my room immediately.  The room does not have carpet which makes for a cleaner room. 2 queen size beds (I was supposed to travel with my wife but she had some business to attend to so did not come with me. Furniture was totally adequate for my needs (4 TO 5 DAYS). The room has air conditioning which is a must (normally) for Papantla. The beds are comfortable although a little soft (for me). The TVs are old sets but perfectly adequate. There is cable.  The Internet works perfectly in the room.",40,1105
" Probably in all rooms since there are multiple routers on every floor. This is a big plus for me. View from the room is the pool. Also you can see the Voladore statue on top of the mountain just out of your window.  The shower head needs to be replaced but the pressure is very good so showers are fine. Plenty of hot water. Amenities are perfect, there is even a movable round mirror with 2 different mirror magnification. Shampoo, body cream and soap are supplied. There is a hair dryer. There should be a better attention to details. For example, there is paint missing on the wall under the window. Minor but should be corrected.  The situation of this hotel is perfect. It is one corner from the Zocalo or historical center where everything happens.  I usually get a hotel near the historical center because this is where you will find restaurants, boutiques and much activity. Also, depending on the purpose of my visit, I like to be there during the weekends since this is when you will encounter a lot of Mexicans.  There are 2 restaurants in this hotel. Neither is wow. The restaurant La Parroquia is a no go. I ordered shrimps in a butter sauce. There was no sauce. I told this to the waiter. He left and never came back to me. There were no excuses, nothing. Also, service was slow. There was only 1 waiter and he was swamped. I will obviously never return to this restaurant.  Service at the other restaurant (Totonaca) was much better. I only had breakfast there which was ok.  This was room 40 on the second floor. I then switched to room 52 on the 3rd floor.  The room itself was perfect, basically a little smaller but just as comfortable as room 40. However, it is situated under the washing machines so naps in the afternoon are impossible. Also, people walk with their heels and that makes noise as well. There are nets to prevent pigeons from sitting on window ledge but they need to be repaired so, in the morning, you will be woken up by the pigeons. The view is, well, keep the drapes drawn.  I definitely will return to that hotel but not in room 52.",40,1105
…,40,1105
"Reading other reviews it sounds like the hotel has had some needed upgrades.  Our bed was excellent and huge (we requested a King).  The room was #63 and called a Junior Suite, but was just a room, possibly larger than a standard.  The room looks out over the street and main plaza.  There was always music playing outside during the day,  but it quieted down completely at night. Someone wrote that Hotel Tajin is a few blocks from the central plaza; it is actually a half a block away.  Driving into Papantla?  I wish you luck!  Lots of one-way streets and screwy intersections!  Map your approach carefully beforehand. ",40,1105
This hotel is in a great location  - just a few blocks from the central square and cathedral - and an excellent view of Papantla. The room was clean and comfortable. The food in the hotel's restaurant was the best I had in Mexico.,40,1105
A quaint hotel located in the heart of the central district! Would definitely stay again. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 is because the towels were really hard and scratchy  Need to use suavatel Breakfast was included... huevos rancheros Were excellent as well as the coffee! 2 really nice restaurants to choose from to eat. We did have a slight problem locating the hotel as it is on a hill and the parking was at the bottom of it. Loved the town especially  On Sunday!!!!,40,1105
Great location.  Very clean. Wonderful staff. Nina was always helpful. Good continental breakfast included.  Our room #8 was very small 1 double bed.. try for a bigger room.  Very nice common areas and a pool.,40,1106
Beautiful place and super clean. Just stayed one night. Just outside the gate you can view the ocean. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows. There is a communal refrigerator to store your drinks. The staff made it 5 stars.,50,1106
"My wife and I stayed here 2 years ago before COVID.  It was so nice we came back again.  The place is exceptional.  Nothing fancy, yet very reasonably priced rooms only a block from the beach.  An easy bus ride from the airport, just walk across the bridge and catch a Compostella bus to Sayulita.  50 pesos.  It drops you off literally around the corner and a 5 minute walk away.  A lot of the downstairs rooms are small and spartan, no TV, microwave or fridge.  Yet reasonable.  There is a nice upstairs terrace that overlooks the street.  Every morning the owners, Theresa and Andres put out lots of great coffee, yogurt, fresh cut fruit and sweet cakes and breads.  They upped their game this year and have lots of great granola as well.  Fridge and microwave for guests in common",50,1106
" area.  Nice refreshing pool in the courtyard.  And clean.... they and their staff appear to be cleaning all day every day.  The place is spotless.  It is one of the few places in Sayulita you can actually use and practice your Spanish.  They do not speak much English at all yet they really try hard to communicate in such a way that the differences are minimal.  I cannot really recommend this place high enough.  It is a hotel that lets you feel as if you are experiencing Mexico while in Sayulita.  Very safe, secure and plenty of great restaurants nearby.  Oh yea..... the beach is just a short block away.",40,1106
…,30,1106
"Hotel Diamanté is a great economy stay on the north end of Sayulita. Only one block to the beach, and with a great pool to float or read in. Rooms are simple, clean and comfortable. The hotel felt very safe and I appreciated seeing the hotel owner Theresa every day.  Basic breakfast and coffee offered every morning (but one of the best breakfast cafes is right next door). I wish they had in-room safes but otherwise my stay was great. As a female solo traveler, it’s important that I’m safe and comfortable and I felt very safe here.",40,1106
"This hotel is still a good choice, but services have been cut back. The kitchen is no longer available to prepare your own meals, but the hotel provides a minimal breakfast: sweet loaves from Costco, fresh fruit, yogurt w/ sugary cereal for garnish and coffee from an ancient percolator! All sugar and mediocre coffee. The upstairs kitchens are closed and the outside sitting areas are open to smokers, so bad luck for you if guests in the adjacent rooms are smokers. To add to the dreariness of the dark furnishings, the managers have covered the open walled areas upstairs with ugly tan-coloured coarse cheap material more suitable for ground cover on a utility vehicle. Simple white bamboo blinds would be so much prettier so guests could choose to open or close them. The hotel is",50,1106
" still spotlessly clean, the managers are friendly, and the dipping pool w/ fountain is relaxing and refreshing.",50,1106
…,50,1106
"Our stay at Hotel Diamante was cozy, and personal with hotel staff (Theresa who runs the place).  Except for the second night when I was awakened by the neighbors in the next room, which were laughing and having a great time at around 1 am.  I had to turn on the A/C and ceiling fan to make some drowning noises.  The following day a complained to Theresa and she said they were checking out that day, and told my I should of knocked on their door.  Later that day, I found out who was in that room and it was one of the cleaning ladies, I guess with a boyfriend !!  So I found out that the cleaning maids stay on grounds.  My findings without asking, by observing the guest that were coming and going from their rooms.  No one came in or out of that room that was a guest except one of",50,1106
The staff was VERY nice. We arrived early and left late and they were very accommodating. Hotel was close enough to the action and beach without being right on top of it. The pool in the middle of the hotel was AWESOME!!!! We could watch our kids swim right from our hotel room. The kitchenette saved us a lot of money from eating out every meal.,50,1107
"I would stay here again! Gorgeous decor throughout the hotel and guest rooms. The pool is beautiful. The back lawn and patio are lovely. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Very clean and well kept. The rooms are very spacious and include a kitchenette. The bed was very comfy, as well.",50,1107
"My family stayed here and were very impressed with the hotel and staff! The rooms and property were very clean and tidy. The hotel is the perfect distance from the downtown area and the beach, only 5 minutes walking. I would strongly reccommend anyone coming to sayulita to stay here! I can’t say enough about how great the staff was in accommodating us! Stay at the Riviera Sayulita Hotel!",50,1107
"We’ve been a couple of days here. We got Del Mar Villa and everything was awesome. The room is front beach, air condition, espacios shower, small living area, kitchen area… and the most spectacular… an awesome terrace where you can sit, take a coffe and see the sunrise.   You can order room service or go down to eat something at the restaurant. It could be for breakfast, dinner or lunch. A quick option to have a meal.  It’s a walking distance from downtown… almost 3 minutes, but that’s great because you rest in a quiet place, calm …  Another great thing, is the pool. It’s climatized, so you can spend many hours on it with a great temperature.   I totally recommend it!!!",50,1109
"First, the grounds are gorgeous and each room is so unique and beautiful. You honestly can’t go wrong. HOWEVER, the stairs are no joke!!! We were lucky and stayed in the Cascadas room which was right near the pool and the front of the hotel and restaurant. A lot of other people in our party had to basically climb a mountain to get to their room.   The staff was fantastic. From the front desk to house keeping, everyone was welcoming and friendly. Ivan and Fran at the bar were our favorites though. They always remembered our names and greeted us with a huge smile. These two helped make our Sayulita experience more memorable than I could have hoped for!",50,1109
"Overall I’d give this stay 3.5 Stars. The view was top notch, the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating but a few things caused our stay to be less amazing than expected. We were excited to be able to book a last minute trip to Sayulita and stay in the Mi Amor Villa which boasts a beautiful view of the beach, a private balcony with an outdoor tub overlooking the ocean. The website does state that you must climb stairs to reach this room/view. Being healthy and fairly fit we underestimated the inconvenience this steep task would be on our relaxing vacation. These stairs are not for the faint of heart. 160 steep uneven steps will get you up to your room. Pause midway for a breather and by the time you reach the top you’ll be ready to lounge in the room and never leave",30,1109
 again.  It really isn’t a huge deal if you plan on staying in your room for the whole trip. We were excited to go swimming at the beach and into town for breakfast and dinner but that had us traipsing up and down those stairs 4x a day and it wasn’t fun. It was daunting and exhausting. To top it all off the week we were in Sayulita was over crowded and excessively noisy. The town was filled to the brim with partygoers celebrating the Holy Week of Easter. Mi Amor villa has zero soundproofing. Expect to be able to hear everything your neighbors are saying and doing. We couldn’t sleep at night because an awful beach nightclub was playing incessant techno music from 10pm to 5am every night. The sound somehow magically travels up into the room as if you are actually on the beach at this club. If you want peace and quiet relaxation go to Punta Mita instead.,20,1109

"This is a tough review to write because the experience here has been so uneven. Ricardo at the front desk is fantastic, while his colleague Judy is rude and unpleasant. Some of the rooms are fabulous with amazing views, while others have beds that are so soft it's like you're falling into a waterbed. Bonus: we had one room that had a broken pipe in the ceiling above and water was dripping on our faces the entire night. While they upgraded us to a better room - which is the default when there is a dangerous leak like this - they didn't comp us the night we spent in that room. Overall, Villa Amor next door was a much better experience for us last year. Again, very uneven experience here with the rooms and the service, so it's a lottery. Our gratitude to Ricardo for his great",10,1109

"Great location/staff. Some Villas in better condition than others. On site restaurant and bar convenient, but expensive. Poor value for price. Once you get past the initial “wow”-this emperor has few clothes.",10,1109
"Don’t stop on this one. When renting a “Villa” one expects a few amenities such as some artwork on the walls, clean sheets, a plug close to your bed, and a full kitchen. One does not expect dirty sheets, one tall glass in the kitchen, a small blender, no placemats , no platters, aweful coffee and cups for your coffee one would see at a motel six. The place has zero charm. The owners clearly want your money but do not wish to expend anything above and beyond.  There are also only two lounge chairs for the two bedroom unit. To top it off, you need to hide all food at night, because the kitchen is open air and there are large mammals which crawl on the kitchen counters.  You are also asked not to put any toilet paper in the toilets .  If you enjoy paying a lot of money to camp out,",10,1109
A place to meet really lovely people in the best location in Sayulita—less than 5 min walk from the beach and plaza yet far enough away that you can’t hear the all-night parties going on. Can’t wait to return.,50,1110
"Wish I could leave a zero star review. Stayed here with my girlfriend in one of the private rooms, room was good just didn't get cleaned during our 3 day stay. Never given a towel on check in, got it at 11pm when we came back from dinner and a few drinks. Was never given the WiFi code which didn't matter as it was non existent in our room.  The worse came on the morning of check out, the owner came and woke us up at 9am saying to come to reception to pay even though we paid online and had confirmation of this. He then started saying that he couldn't access the money we had paid so we would have to pay twice. We refused as we had proof we had paid the money so he threated to call the police, so we left. Don't stay here as he is a scammer",10,1110

This is my second time at Amazing hostel. I stayed at other hostels before but I knew exactly where to go when I needed someplace quiet to relax away but still walking distance from the beach. The atmosphere is is great! I've met so many friends here. The rooms are always clean. The restrooms are always clean. And showers with hot or cold water. The volunteers are above excellence. They really care about their work. And are always there if you need anything. The Owners Suzy and her husband Anhuar are super kind. They really care about the place and always make sure the place is top notch. I really enjoy laying by the pool and reading a book and using the kitchen to make my meals. They have everything you need to prepare your meals. I also recommend taking Spanish class with,50,1110

You can even walk to the sister property's scenic rooftop pool and bar to be treated like a special guest. Breakfast and happy hours are a must! We have no regrets about booking this hotel rather than our typical bigger resorts. Etzel, Martha, and Jerry will ensure your stay is perfect!

"Our goal was simply to choose a place to stay in the middle of Sayulita. We didn’t set very high expectations. El Pueblito Sayulita exceeded expectations. It’s like a small community in the hotel- everyone eats an awesome breakfast from their amazing staff and then hangs out by the pool throughout the day. The rooms are like mini two story condos. The big surprise was the staff’s ability to handle concierge-like requests. Amparo at the front desk was amazing - she scheduled boat trips, rides, ziplines. She called venues on my behalf to ask questions etc. Amparo’s help made my family’s trip.   I left my phone in the cab to the airport. Who did I call to help me solve it? Amparo - she called the cab and made a deal to have him come back. So awesome.",50,1113
"This is a totally adequate hotel but be sure to confirm what you booked when you arrive, as it felt like they deliberately tried to scam us. We booked a Master Suite Premium online (2 floors, 2 bedrooms, kitchen, balcony w/ view of pool)  but when we were arrived we were put in the worst room in the hotel: last room on the bottom floor, dark, behind the bar, next to storage closet, no view, no wifi, shower didn't work properly and a light from hallway shone into the room all night.  When we asked why we weren't in the room we reserved, they said there was nothing they could do but would  move us to the correct room the next day and would include breakfast. We asked for a refund for the difference and they said someone tomorrow would take care of it.   They called us the next",30,1113
" afternoon and we moved to the correct room which was a huge improvement, plenty of space. We asked for a refund for the difference in room price and again were told someone would refund us the following day. This continued our whole stay and we were never given a refund, which is why I am giving a lower rating.  That being said the location was excellent, easy walking distance to everything. The breakfast was decent, we only ate there once. The suite is the way to go, nice to have the balcony and 2 bathrooms. The pool was nice. Pool/beach towels were not available the majority of our stay. There was a festival going on one night which was quite loud so if that is a priority you may want to stay further outside of town. We did not find the front desk staff very friendly or helpful. I would recommend this as a good location,  but be careful they give you the room you booked.",50,1113

"My wife and I spent the last 8 days at El Pueblito Sayulita.  I highly recommend this hotel for the following reasons: value, rooms, restaurant/bar, service and location.  All of the service was fantastic including Patricio, Amparo but especially Jonathon who served us breakfast every morning by the beautiful pool and rented us a golf cart we used to cruise around town and adventure through the jungle.  The location is perfect as it is a 5min walk to the plaza and near north beach which is less crowded & less rocky.  I work remote and the internet worked well.  I did notice a little slow down in the afternoons probably as folks returned from their day trips and logged on.  A couple of nitpicky suggestions: wash clothes would be great and coffee available from 7am.  Maybe a",40,1113

"The property is lovely. The stone steps and tiled hallways are beautiful and we loved the balcony overlooking the pool. The staff were helpful. The restaurant has a nice breakfast outdoors. The location is close enough to take a short walk to any restaurant in town yet far enough from the hubbub in the evening to be quiet.   It is so close to being a great property, but the cold hot tub and unheated pool make it prettier to look at than to use. More importantly, the furniture is right down uncomfortable. There is no proper couch and the chairs are hard. It makes relaxing difficult because spending all evening in the room is not inviting. One of our showers worked and the other had a weak water flow. There are no kitchen towels or knives. In fact, towels are in short supply and",50,1113

I have stayed in four different rooms and they are all lovely and inviting but they are all different and unique in their own way with stunning decor from local artists. My visits have been both as a guest when others are staying and it operates as a boutique hotel and twice as the leader of a private group to buy out the entire property for 5-6 nights. Logan, the manager, is absolutely a dream to work with in the planning process for the groups, as well as on-site with coordinating everything from airport transfers to in-villa massages. Ellie and Rosa who make the elaborate breakfasts and do all the housekeeping are just the most lovely people. The entire staff",50,1114

All the guests I've had for my private group trips have absolutely fallen in love with all things Villa Lola and the neighborhood (Zona Romantica). You cannot do any better than staying here and I am always incredibly sad to leave and eager to come back. The staff and the owners' pride in the place shines through everything they do... And the rooftop pool and seating is my happy place. ,50,1114

You can even walk to and from downtown, which we did several times.  Sam, the owner, is welcoming and so accommodating, bringing in a masseuse for our visit, as well as a Covid testing service prior to our flights home, so we didn't have to search one out.

The owners, Sam and Xeno have been on the property for over two decades so they know Puerto Vallarta.  The same chef and staff were there from my original trip.  I think that speaks highly of HM.

Full disclosure this was one of the most expensive places we have been in Mexico but I think is well worth the price. They have eight rooms (could be the only couple there or fully booked) and we were lucky enough to meet some great people from all parts of the US. Staying at the hotel is the best part but we did enjoy, walks on the beach, messages on the beach, and a day trip into Sayulita.",50,1116

They are all great and accurate adjectives but not even all together can they begin to describe the way guests feel about Casa de Mita. You want great food? Check!

The rooms are amazing, the dining areas are beautiful, the pool is perhaps the most comfortable pool I’ve ever experienced (complete with swim up bar) and there are lounge areas perfect for reading.  3) This is the most important part: the people are wonderful.

" family. They truly make the experience.   Some additional thoughts, in no particular organization: - The food is really good. Wide range of options at each meal, and the kitchen is very accommodating if say you can’t choose between two dinner options and they make you a mixed plate of both.  - The drinks are perfect. Go with the staff recommendation wherever you can — they make some excellent original house cocktails.  - There are some attractions nearby like the town of Sayulita and Punta Mita just to the South, but really the best thing to do here is to stick around the casa and relax.  - The place is small and we have been lucky to be able to socialize with the other guests during our visits. Everyone is nice.  - Do the tequila tasting — it’s a lot of fun.  - Re: COVID, the staff is very safe (they wear masks 100% of the time) and they make getting a COVID test very easy. You are required to get one for reentry to the US, so they actually get some clinicians to come to you at Casa de Mita a couple days before your flight to administer the test. Could not have been easier.   To reiterate: we will be coming here every year for the rest of our lives. Everyone should aim to stay here at some point, for the beautiful views, experience and wonderful people.",50,1116

" the tacos. Ever and his staff are amazing. Great and getting everyone involved and really fun. Pool volleyball, basket ball 21, it was all fantastic. (Hi From ESPN and O!)   Food is amazing. the steak tacos in Fridas, and the tableside guacamole. SO GOOD. We would have an extra dissert at Fridas almost every night. The churros. Ther manager there (Eulises)  was so great. Also made room for us and also on my husbands birthday made him a big steak, not on the menu. My daughter loved the noodles at sin lin. She asked for the plain. The chef came out 2x. Once making sure she really wanted them plain!? and the other to see if she really wanted them plain after she was served them. She LOVED them, and he thought it was so funny she loved them. He then delivered them another night to a different restaurant! So fun!! Also the popsicles- might be the best kept secret. They must have brought her 15 a day. Also the kids picnic programs looked fun! At 14, mine did not want to go to them, but did go to the animal show and LOVED IT. The night time shows were also very good!  Covid precautions were great. The Hawk is amazing and fun to watch.   A few things I think could be improved- these DID NOT impact our trip We stayed 10 nights. With only 4 restaurants whose menu's don't change (Azul not open for dinner) by about night 7 we were board. We are solving this by next time in April staying only 6 days.  Azul- this is the only place I was not impressed with. Dirty plates on tables for long periods of time, they even sat us at a table where the floor was covered in food. I also saw people getting food I did not see at the buffet, so I think you can order things there, but no one ever stopped at our table whom we could ask.   Teen club did not open until 3- would be nice to open at lunchtime  Do yourself a favor- book this resort. It is as amazing as ALL the reviews say.",50,1120

"We have been visiting the Grand Velas since 2009, about once a year. We have never been disappointed with the service, from check in to check out and everything in between. The dinner restaurants are absolutely incredible, and the staff all around the hotel is as good as it gets. We hope to continue coming back for years to come.",50,1120
"We had the best time at Grand Velas. The location was stunning, the food was incredible (as was the service) and the spa really made it a once in a lifetime experience! I got a massage and loved the water therapy experience beforehand. Sen Lin has incredible Asian food. Can’t wait to return!!",50,1120
"This hotel had wonderful food and options for the entire family. The dual Mexican and Continental Breakfast options were always on point and a great way to start the day before heading to the pool to relax (the brioche French toast, pastries and chilaquiles were a must!).  Grilled octopus and tacos were wonderful in the afternoon and at night, guests had a choice of 4 brilliantly crafted restaurants to choose from (Mexican, Italian, Pan-Asian/Thai and French).  My personal favorites were the Mexican and French restaurants. The wine list and signature cocktails on offer were a home run. The French born Head Chef, Guillaume Morancé, really understood the flavors of Mexico and offered up Oaxacan and Mayan inspired dishes in a very sophisticated way (be sure to order the Mayan",50,1120
 Panucho with Cochinita Pibil !! The variety of food and quality far exceeded my expectations for an all inclusive resort. I easily give the culinary experience five stars for adults and it is very family friendly too (my 3 year old niece had just as much fun sampling the kid friendly options). Would recommend !!   - Chad from New York,50,1120
"I can't add much to the previous reviews - Hotel Casa Chacala is a very nice little hotel, clean, well-kept, and conveniently located a short walk (maybe 200-300 yards/meters) from the beach and the local amenities, with friendly helpful staff (with some who speak English, which is very helpful for those of us whose Espanol is basically non-existent).   Most of the other guests during our stay were families out for the Easter and Santa Semana holidays weeks.  There was a bit of noise from the pool area sometimes in the afternoon or evening - children playing, young adults being young adults, but nothing too raucous, and it died down early.  And, of course the sounds from the town can't be avoided, but that too did not run too late even on the busy holiday weekend.  After the",50,1121
" holiday passed, it was pretty quiet all over.    A simple but adequate common area and kitchen is downstairs next to the pool area.  Room had a small refrigerator and microwave, and we used some of the flatware and dishes from the kitchen.  You can get in-room coffee in the morning, but we elected the coffee maker option to brew our own, and got an electric kettle and french press, which we greatly appreciated.  Fresh, hot coffee on the balcony in the morning:  priceless!   (Pick up some Cafe Arisan at the market in La Penita).    Views are obscured a bit by some of the newer hotels in front - some of which may also be nice but, for the price, you can't beat Casa Chacala.    COVID precautions were adequate, and easy to deal with since just about everything is open air except in the rooms.    We were advised that making reservations directly with the hotel by phone or email - instead of through online booking services - will get you a better price.",50,1121

"We spent a week as guests of the wonderful folks at Casa Chacala. Valentine, Lupe and Rosa made sure that all our needs were met. The room was always clean and well-kept, and the view from our balcony was beautiful. The  amenities included a nice pool that was cleaned daily. There is an outdoor kitchen facility, with sodas for purchase. Coffee was always available at 0700, and refills were promptly provided. Bed was comfortable, and towels were large and fluffy. Highly recommend this property!",50,1121
"After little more than a year we decided to go back to Chacala and our hotel, Casa Chacala. It felt as if the proprietor, Valentin was an old  friend.  He did everything he could to make our return visit even more pleasant than the first. In addition, a mutual friend from Mexico City made the long bus trip to join us.  The rooms are very clean and reasonably priced and the location is a short block from the beach.  We are already thinking about our next visit.",50,1121
"Very comfortable spot to stay in Chacala! New and comfortable bedding, towels and curtains. Followed suite from other reviews and asked for a coffee maker for the room which was helpful and handy!  Very helpful and accommodating hosts as I had to make a couple of changes to itinerary and nothing was too much trouble. Would highly recommend. Thanks for looking after us - Sonya and Gary - New Zealand",50,1121
"We spent 2 nights at casa Chacala and had such a great time that we are going back with friends at the end of the month! Everything at casa Chacala was clean and well run, we had a comfortable king size bed- hard to find in Mexico a lovely balcony with a table and two chairs a fridge as well as free reign of the outdoor kitchen and common areas which included a sparkling clean pool, outdoor tables & chairs( great for playing cards) and hammocks, the parking was under cover and secure everything needed was provided including complementary coffee each morning. The best part was Lupita & Valentene, the owner & his niece, they were so warm and friendly that they really made our experience outstanding! We will be going back many times in the future!",50,1121
"We stayed here recently for 10 days in room #4 on the 3rd floor. We had a very comfortable king size bed, fridge and coffeemaker (requested) with delicious coffee supplied. The view over the bay from our patio is lovely and a small table and 2 chairs are supplied. There's an immaculately maintained pool with a couple of lounge chairs, a common area kitchen and patio area, and a fridge there with refrescos and beer.  The facilities are well-maintained and housekeeping is efficient and thorough with towels and sheets changed regularly. The hotel is easy to find; it's right on the main road as you enter town.  It's kept secure, but we never felt unsafe anywhere in town anyhow. The family that operates the hotel as well as the housekeeper are just wonderful people, very",50,1121

"The hotel was great! Like an American hotel, with great working AC. In the heart of Tepic, Nayarit. The room service was great and they cleaned every day without us asking. The breakfast that was included was really good. Different options of meats /sides every single day. The only thing I didn't like about the breakfast was the chef. His food was great but is SUPER rude. Not once did I receive a ""Buenos dias"" back from him out of the 4 mornings that I ate there. I didn't eat breakfast my last morning there because I didn't want to deal with his rudeness. He either doesn't like his job or doesn't like people in general, but aside from that I would definitely stay here again. And plan on it every time I visit Tepic. ",50,1122
I don’t recommend this hotel while it’s decently clean all the rooms have vents that connected to eachother. In the morning I could look up into the room above us. There was a man coughing wry loudly and with the current health situation it was difficult to be in the same living space as someone else. The cathedral bells also go off every 15 minutes starting at 6:30am. If you plan on sleeping past 6:30 it will most definitely not happen at this hotel. ,10,1122
"Hotel is nice, Clean, new. Some of the waitresses are not friendly. But the biggest problem is almost no one speaks English. While we were there, almost all guest were American or Canadian, and one could understand because the staff does not speak English.",40,1122
I was just passing by and I had to book a last minute. I was there for only for 1 night on Friday November the 5th.  Great service and value. the room was spacious with a great view and what I liked the most was the complementary breakfast  and the people who served us!!!,50,1122
"There is nothing to say the place is perfect, it is elegant as well. It is in the center of Tepic. It comes with free hot breakfast buffet.  The restaurant has great real Mexican food full of traditional flavors, It also offers continental food. ",50,1122
"Great staff, huge room, best showers in Mexico! Underground parking was a bonus.  We walked all over Centro historic and enjoyed the accessibility to everything. Clean, quiet and great breakfast. We had a lovely park outside. We will be back! ",50,1122
"The Hotel has a very good location in the downtown, nice building & excellent quality, the Master Suit is amazing! and the price the best! The personnel is very kind! the effectiveness of the service is a an opportunity, My family and many friends of the group passed special situation that expected the Hotel´s personnel react in a better way in spirit to solve situation and provide help to compensate unfotunatelly situation, but it was not; Late in deliver the room, late the maintenance of the room, more than 3 times asked to the desk for support but it was late response and /or not performed. mistake on invoice, but in general very good experience! I fully recomend this place.",40,1122
The customer service was more than exceeding expectation as for the room it was very clean and comfortable.  The housekeeping staff were very nice and did a good job.  The breakfast is one thing I will miss food was delicious. ,50,1122
This is the best hotel in downtown Tepic very popular with visitors for events etc. The restaurant is good and not too expensive. The breakfast is so-so. Rooms are nice and the ones on the upper floors have good views of the city and surrounding hills.  Staff is friendly.,40,1122

"We just got back from a week-long stay at VV and are still over the moon.  When we were enjoying ourselves at the house, we were waited on hand and foot by the amazing staff! The food was wonderfully prepared by Franko and Nestor for all the meals we had (often breakfast and dinner)!  We enjoyed days in the pool and nights on the veranda capturing all of the views that this place has to offer.  We were never without entertainment and the fabulous service of Manny, Freddy, Eddy, and Tony! They took SUCH amazing care of us ALL DAY.   The whole team of the property does a fantastic job keeping the place immaculate and this includes all of the housekeeping (Maribel and Hilda), as well as the gardeners (Julian, Fidel, and Noel)!

Jose was always checking if everything was ok. Bartender Freddy a shot ready for you , Eddy was always curious if anything was needed and would be there with in a flash, Manny was always flashing those pearly whites and a great laugh. I never saw the chefs (Nestor and Franco)work harder on making you go to heaven than in this place. The food blew me away. Most hotels the food okay at best. Villa Verano iv never had food so amazing. Even the maids Hilda and Maribei always a smile with good morning attached to it.

Delicious meals, fabulous desserts, and always beautiful flowers and place settings. *Jose, Head Houseman - the awesome manager of this villa.  Always good to see his welcoming smile.   *Lenor, Concierge - she's not seen, but the results of her time with Sherry MacKinnon arranging accommodations for our perfect vacation is obvious.   *Freddy, Eddy, Manny and Tony - Assistant Housemen - these guys are so much fun and really",50,1123

"THE GOOD: Hotel San Jorge is located 1 block from the Centro Histórico plaza and Cathedral. There also many historical buildings, museums and art galleries with their architecture spanning the 16th thru the 19th centuries. The hotel is attractively decorated and has free parking, The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean with comfortable beds, good shower facilities, fans, air conditioning, strong WiFi and excellent TV service. The restaurant has simple yet tasty fare, and you can have an excellent breakfast with coffee for less than $5 USD. Lastly the price for my room was inexpensive considering the quality received (~$42 USD per night).  THE BAD: No bad. For the price this hotel is definitely on the higher end of the scale. The only issue for me was there is no",40,1124
" upper end restaurants in this area which require a taxi to reach. The restaurants that are close by are few and with simple limited menus.  THE UGLY: Definitely no ugly, but to get 5-stars the hotel is dated and needs a renovation, the restaurant menu needs to expand and a hotel bar would need to be added. BUT this is a hotel in Tepic, México that serves mostly the Mexican business class. To do too much renovation would cause prices to rise and affect their bookings unless they took the renovation to a 5-star standard which then might draw a more affluent clientele. My personal opinion is they already have a recipe for success. If it ain’t broke . . . etc.  The was a most enjoyable hotel, and the price made it most enjoyable indeed!!!",30,1124

"8-9/5  We three British middle aged guys had spent many daytime hours travelling from Guanajuato in a combination of buses, coaches and a taxi to the hotel.  We arrived at 7:25 Tepic time and were greeted in reception and  Room 201 was in the far left corner of the large hall space. Medium size bright white room. A fitted wardrobe with four coat hangers on left as you walk in.  Two double beds (English double but American single by the sounds of some complaints) with a single long wooden headboard and bedside table between the two. An adjustable central reading lamp with a loose lampshade was between the two beds along with an electric socket and control for the central fan (no A/C) and the central light.   Only to towels and glasses were provided along with a jug for topping up",30,1125
" from the hall water dispenser.  A wall mounted wooden dressing table with a drawer and shelves and a mirror above. A wooden table with two wooden dining chairs.  Diaphanous white curtains covered the large metal frame grid windows looking onto the Main Street and HFJS. I thought we might be able to hitch the strong WiFi from that hotel but the passwords had changed since!   We went to the Capistrano Restaurant in the Hotel Fray Junipero Serra for an evening meal and La Gloria next door for a drink and returned around 11:20 and to our surprise a doorman saw us coming and opened the door for us (we are not used to that service since HFJS thirteen months ago when we passed through Tepic before).  After an hour in the quiet hallway catching up with social media and writing TA reviews (using the better WiFi) we went to bed.  Despite potential noise from hall and street it was survey quiet and we slept well on the (big for us English) double comfortable beds. We did not have to cuddle up or spoon.  The showerroom had a towelrail, floor towel and a flannel as well as toiletries. A central fluorescent strip light above a diffuser lit the room and I added my electric socket LED lamp to the side to help shaving. The water pressure was very low (a common complaint along with the WiFi) and it was difficult jetting out my shaver. The shower water pressure was also low and the shower tepid as a result; I suppose this is one way of conserving water! If you are expecting a power shower you will not get it!   The WiFi in that (and other rooms according to reviews) seems to be a problem. The location of the transmitter router should be relocated close to the stairwell so it can spread the signal and penetrate the doors opposite. In the morning my friend sat under the router but still could not get online despite a connection. I tried too with no result. I tried 4G too with no results!! The whole town’s internet was down! This is a real problem for a city based on business (not tourism) and is a national infrastructure problem. Luckily San Blas is full of hotels you can just walk into to get a room (as we did today - posting from El Bucanero now).  ",50,1125

"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. My wife is Mexican and she was very happy. As an American I'm used to more luxury...especially in a downtown area. But the building was charming. The hot water in the shower didn't work but staff told us to just let the hot water run for 5 minutes and eventually we'd get hot water...and we did. We checked out the hotel across the street. Very elegant but twice the price. All in all I was happy with our 2 day stay and when we go back to Tepic, we'll likely stay here again.",30,1125
"If you are looking for a mediocre room for about $750 pesos per night (2 people) this is your hotel.  Three floors, no elevator so if you have trouble climbing stairs, you should ask for a lower floor......we got ""the master"", the best they had. It came with two full size beds only. Very plain.  They did have water in the hallway with a pitcher in your room with glasses.  Our room had WiFi, but could not get a signal our whole stay. It also had a flat screen TV with cable but our second day the cable was out the whole day.  We had air conditioning that worked very well. Typical mini bars of soap and really bad shampoo, but we had our own so no problems there.. Towels were generous size but no wash clothes.  Water pressure and hot water were none existent.  ONLY Spanish spoken so",30,1125
 if you don't know Spanish good luck. Good news is that is right at Historico Centro within walking of the best of the city.  Cabs are cheap if you want to go further. We took a Combi to La Laguna at Santa Maria Del Oro for a day trip and it was also very economical.  Beautiful Volcanic lake so if you like swimming or boating the place to visit.,40,1125
"If you don't want to sleep, don't want to have coffee or food, this is the place for you. I have NO idea how this hotel stays in business......It says there is a restaurant....maybe in the past, but not as of late January 2018.

The door on our closet was broken and the shower leaked onto the floor in the bathroom. The internet did not work very well.",10,1126
"This hotel is badly in need of a remodel. The a/c did not cool. There was no hot water in the bath room needless to say there was also no soap. The bed linens were old and well worn. And to top it off the free breakfast was not very good, then they charged us $180 pesos for it.",20,1126

I would of been raging in anger if I paid full price of $1,200 pesos.  There are no drawers.  The only closet space you get a is a 2 foot tube in the bathroom with 2-3 hangers.  No fridge. No coffee maker. No washcloth, what’s up with that? No pool.  No phone to call receptionist.  ",30,1128
"Unless you look & speak Spanish don't bother! Very rude, ignored us and spoke to another couple who entered after us. No service at breakfast! Although the waiter was falling over a couple of older Mexican ladies. Terrible hotel. Breakfast was an extra charge too, which we were not told when we checked in.",10,1128
"I have to say this is one of the worse hotels I’ve ever staid at. The gal at the front desk was rude. They didn’t have my reservation in the system AND to top it off I got a terrible room on the 1st floor next to the cleaning supplies, which meant I had NO privacy since there was constant movement outside.

"Even that the hotel is located right in Tepic downtown and we had a street view room, we had a lovely rest night, I assume it was the bed, the mattress, great temperature, nice windows and proper curtains. Since we arrived the bell boy (Brayan) gave us a great service. I was out all afternoon but my wife and soon stayed and enjoyed the time. Both of us ordered to room service and it was SO good for a hotel, next day we took our breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and was delicious, great service too and full of local people, which means is a good options.

"While I was staying in San Pancho in Nayarit, Mexico in late October 2015, I received a pre-sunrise phone call that began with, ""Pack your stuff and get out RIGHT NOW. Hurricane Patricia is a category 5 and headed straight towards us. Drive to Tepic and get a hotel."" Gulp. I had never been to Tepic, did not have a map, did not have any hotel information, and only spoke a little bit of travel Spanish. Not having any options, I indeed packed my stuff pronto, loaded my rental car, and got on the two-lane highway that goes to Tepic. As I reached the outskirts of the city, I had to make a quick decision on where to turn off. I chose ""Centro"" since that would be where the main church was, and therefore the main town plaza, and hopefully a charming hotel. Sure enough, within a few",50,1130
" minutes, there was the church, a large plaza, and -- thank goodness -- a hotel oozing with charm. Hotel Real de Don Juan's front desk staff welcomed me and my frazzled nerves, kindly tolerated my poor Spanish and produced an English speaker, pointed out their restaurant, parked my rental car for me, and led me to my room. Spotless, comfortably furnished, and with a view of the hills from windows that opened. Whew! After settling in, I ate a late lunch in their restaurant, which was delicious and served by kind and competent wait staff. When I finally crawled into bed and felt how wonderfully comfortable it was, I knew that I had found the ideal haven. We now know Hurricane Patricia chose a different path, and I was able to return to San Pancho the next day -- after enjoying a splendid and beautifully presented breakfast with cappuccino.",50,1130
…,40,1130
"At every visit in Tepic we usually end up staying at the Real de Don Juan for at least two nights. You want a garden side room, because street side can be a little noisy. Rooms are spacious, elegantly decorated, and clean. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The attending restaurant is excellent and very affordable. If you like beeing catered to, you will love the restaurant and its waiters. The service is amazing and the food is delicious. The only negative point is Wi-Fi access that seems unstable and beds are european style, so very soft mattresses. I definitely recommend this hotel and its roof top pool in the warmer months.",50,1130
"For $50.  Dirty noisy and NOT close to downtown# I think trip advisor has been bought off. Until this trip we could rely on t.a. but not so much any more. Plus! Their new web page is too difficult to navigate. Take the bus to Centro. Across from central de auto bus is burger king, the city bus stops there. Whee! What a ride! I love mexico. Hotel los Girasoles is nice and close and 250 pesos less! It is half a block from old centro. Local busses leave from here.",20,1131
"Two-minute walk from the bus station. I paid $31/night, credit cards accepted. Room was small. Good A/C. Clean. Shower was fine. Wifi worked. Outstanding restaurant onsite--truly a pleasant surprise. (Didn't care for the included breakfast buffet, though--the options were not geared for gringos.) Perfect place to break up a long bus trip. If you want to hang out in Tepic, there are hotels directly adjacent to the Plaza Mayor...",40,1131
"The hotel is literally behind the bus station, and a 25 peso taxi from the center. Our room was on the side street, so we did sleep with earplugs. The rooms on the street were much bigger than the inside ones however, so we didn't mind the compromise.  The rooms and bathrooms are very clean and well-maintained.  Breakfast included is excellent- a buffet with many options and eggs made to order. Great coffee :) The downside for me was the street noise and a group of teenagers on a school trip who had absolutely no consideration for yelling in the hallways. The hotel staff is very kind and accommodating. Recommend if passing through Tepic by bus. ",40,1131

Too many relatives showed up at the same time, and some of us had to go to a hotel, this was our pick, really, based only on Tripadvisor.  I was impressed right out of the gate, the desk had our reservations no problem and they gave us suggestion about the better rooms, very friendly and professional. The rooms themselves were not the epitome of luxury, but they were clean and functional. And given the price, a real bargain.    I travel often on a motorcycle, although not this time, but if I had, I would have enjoyed the fact that the parking is enclosed and in sight of the rooms. At night there is a gate that closes making it even safer for the bike.   Technically the hotel is in the historic",40,1132
" center, but that's a stretch. However, a 10 minute walk does put you at the edge of the REAL historic center. Which, BTW, is very interesting in a low key way. The central square is lined with market stalls from the local indigenous peoples (Huichole) that make bright yarn crafts.   That said, there is plenty going on around the hotel; there are bars and restaurants around that that are very good (and cheap by US standards). In particular, there is a very nice steak house (Las Banderillas) two blocks away that has mastered a steak cooked ""rare"". I did not try the hotel restaurant, and by the looks of it, not many people have.  The hotel is right across the street from a big park that is perfect for that early morning workout. A two Km loop is great for getting in those miles, and there is a Paracourse a few hundred meters away to work out at, with various machines to work on any muscle group you are interested in.   I would recommend this for anyone driving thru that wants to take a peek at the town. It is on the old main highway thru the town, so it is easy to get to (but slow, as there are a million traffic lights), and the cleanliness, price and parking make it a no stress stop.",50,1132

"Staying in bucerius for couple weeks decided take side trip to Tepic,clean friendly city all you need,polite people etc ..stayed at villa las Rosas, even though don't speak much Spanish staff very helpful and understanding. Restaurant was awesome...food first rate and service even better..clean cheap rooms and secure parking...don't miss out on this gem if you are in town!",40,1132
"Es un hotel muy bonito, la gente es amable y servicial, cuenta con un espacio amplió y las habitaciones están limpias y se miran bien, es ideal para pasar la noche o un par de días si es que pasas por este lugar tan bonito que es Tepic, lo más importante está en una zona céntrica ",30,1133
"No tienen agua caliente, secadora para el cabello, los colchones no son comodos es necesario consideren el precio puede ser comprensible la falta de inversión en colchones. La falta de secadores se debe a que no consideras a las mujeres como parte del mercado. Ojalá rectifiquen",30,1133

"Al llegar al hotel me topé con la noticia de que debía entregar una identificación como la de elector o licencia de manejo vigente y ella tenía que permanecer en recepción ante lo cual me note sorprendido porque esos documentos por seguridad no se pueden andar dejando en manos de cualquiera y mucho menos dejar de portarlos con uno mismo solo porque a un hotel de 4ta se le ocurre que es una regla dejarlos. Después de una discusión se inicia con uno de los check-in más absurdos y difíciles que jamás haya experimentado en un hotel, llenado de formatos, que si el control, que la llave… en fin. Para mí fue bastante molesto ya que llegue muy cansado en la madrugada y todavía llegar a realizar sus trámites fue una lata y en la mayoría de los hoteles solo te hacen firmar tu llegada,",20,1133
"Great friendly staff.  Very clean rooms, smelled great and very comfortable beds Shuttle service is a plus Loved the access to the gym and the healthy breakfast options. Will continue to book with this company ",50,1134
"I must say it was super pleasant. Fast check in, super clean, was sick in the morning and they made an appointment with a local doctor right away for me. Best fast efficient hotel chain in Mexico. Thank you!",50,1134
We were passing through on our way to the Oaxacan coast. Hotel Las Palomas provided secure parking for our heavily packed car. The room was clean and comfortable and they have a very nice restaurant with friendly and professional wait staff. The food was delicious! ,50,1135
"After a sleepless night at Hotel Ejecutivo, my brother-in-law searched for a new hotel while my sister went with me for my bone scan.  He found Hotel Las Palomas.  What a HUGE difference........it was such a relief to find such a pleasant and friendly place.  The food in the restaurant was delicious and the service impeccable.  The rooms were really nice, super clean and the beds were so comfortable.  I was there in January 2018 so didn't use the pool, but the jacuzzi was terrific.  This is definitely a hotel to use again.",50,1135
"It was a business trip and really enjoyed the hotel. Even though it was crowded due to vacations and several families staying, there was a good service and clean rooms and not that really noisy. The breakfast buffet is good.",50,1135

4 people (3 adults 1 x 12 yr old) stayed Christmas Eve - leaving Dec 25th  Exceptionally clean - checkin was very efficient  Secure parking outside with guard and electric fence  Very clean pool and separate nice warm whirlpool  Rooms were very clean and great value - Would stay here again without hesitation,50,1135
"That place Looking good and nice but be sure that it's absolutely just a show.. The morning is start in work noises and every day in 05:00 the trine is passed and horn strong and long horn. In the first night we pay 1000 $ and second night 812$ and than we see on the internet that the price is 700$ We try to speak with the Reception but they don't know to speak English, only one of them speak english and we ask for the manager but he didn't come, only after few days we success to catch him and he was rude and think only how he (Mr Gustavo) can finish talk with as he don't like to help or really to hear what we feel.  Only the guard of the hotel was super nice and great service man.  See attached pictures!!!",10,1135
"Our car broke down on the highway from Tepic to Guadalajara very close to Jala town and we were very lucky as we could leave the car on a safe place over there and traveling back to Tepic to stay on a hotel. We had a very nice welcome at the reception and fair price for the room. We had an specific need that is was a phone charger as we had no plans no stay, I now we could buy one at the store but is always nice that a hotel spoil you with some basic stuff that makes you feel “like home” or even better. From the beginning I noted a group of teenagers and I didn´t react at that moment so this is a tip: When you visit a hotel at there is a group of young people PLEASE request a room far away from them. The hotel is nice, they were doing some refurbish in some rooms. I noted that",40,1135
" they had bottled water at the floors, those big 20lts bottles of drinkable water, this is not common any more at the hotels and I think is a nice detail. The room was nice, clean and wide open. The bathroom was clean too and big enough, I like when the shower is a bit separate so you can use the sink or WC if your company is in a hurry. The bed and mattress were absolutely great to rest, but our dreams were interrupted by those teenagers behaving like proper teenagers at 2am. Building walls were also kind of thin as we could hear too much noise from other rooms. Our AC worked OK but it had a massive leak and when we told to the staff on the check-out they knew about it. We highly recommend the breakfast at the hotel, they serve buffet with many options and great quesadillas. If you fancy some mexican local food at night you can visit the tacos and quesadillas little place that is crossing the road. Walking and safe distance you can find WalMart, a Vips restaurant and a small local mall, make sure to don´t walk during the daytime if there is too much hot if you are not used to. Ask for some recommendations for seafood, which is the specialty in Tepic.",40,1135

"It's very comfortable! The buffet is simple and delicious and the beds are ok. The rooms are quite spacious with ac included, the waiters are very nice  If you need a hotel to stay, this is a good choice for a fast stay in the city of Tepic. Keep up the good work! ...............",30,1135
"Stayed a night for business and felt surprised by the very attentive staff, room absolutely clean and comfortable, per de by pillows, comforting and pure white sheets. Needed toothpaste and brush, calls and was brought in less than 5 minutes.   Besides this, is very well located, next to Forum Shops and 8 minutes drive distance from centro histórico. ",50,1136
"We've enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Hotel Fiesta Inn many times, but this time it was not an enjoyable experience.  We hadn't been there for a few months and to our surprise the quality of the buffet had seriously dropped.  The personnnel were as obliging as always, but the four dishes that I tried were definitely a step down compared to what they used to be.  Even the sweet bread which used to be prepared on the premises, was dry and stale.  I truly would not recommend this restaurant.  For us, it was not an enjoyable experience.",30,1136
"Loved the breakfast buffet in the morning, fresh tortillas and a wide assortment of items to eat including some delicious fresh fruit. It's part of the local mall and you can rest assured you are very secure. The rooms are nice and the staff very professional. I would definitely stay again.",30,1136
"Double Beds were small size, not as quoted. Pillows were uncomfortable needs to be with bed size. Checkin / out was comfortable with staff being knowledgeable and experienced. Based on nonof persons, water to be placed in rooms",30,1136
"This hotel is located in a large mall. We were here two nights in March and found the hotel to be very adequate - good shower, friendly staff, functional room and very good internet service. My only complaint, and one common to most hotels in North America now is the miserly ventilation the hotels call ""air conditioning"". The room's temperature hovered at 75 - too warm, in my opinion for comfort or sleeping.Nothing we did with the thermostat seemed to alter the setting, and we slept fitfully with a sheet on, or off. Come on hotels, let your lodgers have comfortable conditions - what's it going to cost???",40,1136
"I stayed on business for the third time, the staff are really helpful and friendly, special thanks to Dafne, Marisol and America. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the free WiFi is fast and reliable. The restaurant serves a good selection at breakfast and the  main course offerings are good quality. I can recommend it. ",40,1136
Convinient for shoping and eating because of connection to big mall. Room is fair. Cleasness OK. Sometimes outside is noisy (Machine sound.). Wifi used to be poor but recentry improved a lot. Somotimes shower is not hot enough. Overall acceptable.,30,1136
Modern hotel with clean comfortable rooms and a good restaurant. There's a mall next door with anything you might need during your stay. A pro soccer team was there during my stay which brought many fans to gather outside. The hotel managed the crowds well and provided a safe environment for the guests. ,50,1136
"The rooms are average. They have a buffet breakfast in the morning. No bathtubs, showers only. Convenient to shopping and cinema and restaurants at the mall. Sam's Club close by. Oxxo close by. Starbucks in the mall. Overall good stay. Enjoy!",40,1136
"While arguably the best choice for business lodging in town, Fiesta Inn Tepic has recently become the Federal Police Force's new operations base... or so it seems. While the law enforcers are kind to the other guests, you can't help but feel intimidated by the branding of high caliber firearms by the Feds. If you're ok being surrounded by Feds carrying high power firearms around the hotel and hanging around these guys at the hotel's gym (they seem to enjoy working out quite often), then I guess Fiesta Inn Tepic should remain your first choice when staying in town for business or pleasure!",40,1136
"I made a reservation directly at the hotel almost a month ago. The person who helped me make the reservation confirmed to me that I had American breakfast included for that special rate. However, today I was charged extra for the breakfast and when I went to the clerk desk to clarify and they told me that that rate didn’t include any breakfast. I told the person there that I had been previously confirmed, however he didn’t care to solve the issue and only replied “I don’t know why they told you this information, there’s nothing I can do”. They have poor customer service and give incorrect information while doing reservations. This is the last time I stay there.",20,1137
We love this hotel and the pool. We always book before our flight out of the local airport but oh my god is the food so nasty. You’re better off getting something from the places near by. The sopa de elote was so sour like it was old. The lettuce was bitter! The shrimp pasta was bland. At night we got a burger and a club sandwich to the room. No flavor and everything tasted old and soggy.  The breakfast wasn’t bad though. ,40,1137
Real good services the staff are the best on meeting the customer service for sure a will recommend this hotel y mi next visit defenetli I will come back to this hotel rooms real clean food good and swimming pool clean ,50,1137
"Nice hotel with lots of character and flair, excellent breakfast buffet. Very friendly staff at the reception, restaurant, and cleaning crew. Nice garden and pool area. Bathrooms and rooms are clean but could use an update at some point in time. Great location to get around town.",40,1137
"I wouldn't recommend it, even if they give me a free service, there is a notorious lack of service, staff looks they are angry, maybe they don't get enough pay. I suggest you really supervise the rooms.",10,1137
"Great hotel and awesome staff, they were very kind to me and helped me navigate my way around, which is important when your Spanish isn't really good. The bed was a hard firm mattress and I am use to sleeping on soft pillow top mattresses so my sleep quality was affected. Clean and professionally operated, there was a problem with the hot water and if they fix that, then I recommend this hotel to anyone. ",50,1137
"Sometimes a mini vacation can be as good as a regular vacation if the hotel accommodations are like or better, coming from the  Grand Hyatt Central Station in New York City to the Best Western in Tepid, Nayarit Mexico was just as good. ",10,1137
please investigate I really need someone to please investigate so that this doesn't happen to anyone anymore it was the worst feeling and experience of my life i was so afraid for my daughter's life and her aunts life ,10,1137
Horrible hotel! Needs extensive updates and cleaning. Some of those updates were trying to be done in middle of the day. Workers were scraping tile or something off of ceilings. As it was falling children were walking underneath without any warning from hotel or workers. Nothing blocked off or letting you know that it was dangerous! Carpets are an ugly dirty green that I don’t think they ever vacuumed. Furniture is falling apart and really old. Tub we had in room always leaked and formed huge puddle when we showered. Beds are hard. I think some people in our group got bed big bites. We had a large group that also had catered breakfast that was the same soggy chilaquiles everyday. We will definitely choose another hotel for our next year visit to Tepic.,10,1137
"We were on a driving trip passing through Tepic and wanted a hotel which was easy to find from highway 15.   Best Western Ne Kie is easy to find on the hwy 15 that goes into town, especially from the south.   Some misses: The front desk staff confused us with their up-sell of the breakfast buffet - very rapid-fire spanish.   Our room key did not work - several times.   They don't supply enough bottled water in the room.  Some hits: very quiet, comfortable sleep.   Pretty good restaurant and breakfast buffet.   Nice pool area.   Lovely ecological park two blocks away.   I would certainly return if I was passing through Tepic.   A bit expensive with the breakfast buffet.",30,1137
"Me hospedé en Casa Mayo del 16-20 de abril, desde la llegada al B&B puedes sentir lo acogedor que es el lugar, cada rincón está pensando a detalle lo que te hace sentir como en casa. Tienen un servicio de café las 24hrs lo cual fue genial para mí que soy amante del café! El B&B está ubicado en una zona muy linda a tan solo 10 minutos del centro lo cual fue muy conveniente.. La hospitalidad de Sheny es indescriptible, se aseguró de que mi estancia fuera de lo mejor, me dio muchas recomendaciones de lugares para visitar, definitivamente ella es la estrella de este lugar! Muy pero muy recomendable!! Definitivamente lo consideraré para mi siguiente estancia :)",50,1138
"Todo mal, mal servicio, mala ubicación, malas instalaciones, lo peor fue la actitud de quien atendía ( Julia) pero aún mucho peor, la de Gaby ( dueña). El costo super caro para lo mal que está el lugar.  Una de las peores experiencias de todos mis viajes. Viajé con mi esposa y mis 3 hijos chiquitos ( 8, 6 y 4) y todo estuvo mal. Desde la llegada con muy mala actitud, poco eficiente ( no nos sentimos para nada bienvenidos), el aire acondicionado no sirvió en la noche, la regadera muy incómoda, las persianas son como de papelería, el ventilador ruidoso y oxidado ( además hay obra al lado que genera mas ruido). Pero lo PEOR de todo, fue que la dueña ( Gaby) literalmente nos amenazó para irnos después de la primera noche ( solo por quejarnos de una pésima atención). Por supuesto se",10,1139

Es la última cabaña de ese lado de la playa, y tiene una vista de toda la bahía además de que desde su terraza se puede ver increíble el amanecer. Se encuentra ubicada donde inicia la subida para ir a punta cometa, así que también subiendo se puede ver el atardecer. La construcción es muy singular, como un caracol, una combinación de materiales logrando un efecto muy atractivo. piedra, laja, bambú y palma. toda la familia estuvimos muy a gusto.",50,1140
I had the opportunity to stay in Terrazas del Rinconcito last October. It is a very romantic place right in the beach. I enjoyed the sunrise. It's a very eco-friendly cabaña. The view is breathtaking. I truly recommend staying here when visiting the ever wonderful Mazunte.,50,1140
"We had a wonderful stay at the Villa Luna de Miel. Don't get me wrong, this is not a  fancy hotel but we had a great experience. The staff was very helpful and aimed to please. We got clean towels and house cleaning daily and clean linens every 3 days. I suggest bringing a face cloth and small hand towel as they only provide bath towels.  There is a 20L bottle of drinking  water in the room for $20 pesos and a mini fridge to cool down your drinks. There is a portable fan and no air conditioning or screens. The mosquitoes and bugs are active at dawn and dusk so don't forget to apply insect repellent. Also ear plugs are necessary to drown out the roosters, dogs and party music and drums.  A headlamp or flashlight is also necessary after dark.  The beach is just a short walk down",40,1141
" the street and the town is lovely and loaded with about 50 restaurants and bars and juice stops and cafes all within 5 minutes. The beach is fabulous, and you only need to buy a few beverages to get use of the beach umbrellas and chairs provided by the many restaurants on the beach. If you prefer, you can purchase an umbrella and blanket and there is tons of room on the beach. Mazunte is a lovely town to spend your vacation. There is a lovely walk to the ridge to enjoy the sunset .  The view from the room is fabulous and worth the flight of 80 stairs to get there.",50,1141

"I think this place used to be wonderful. The location is lovely and the space itself is very pretty - wide rooms with big windows and nice terraces. Unfortunately, it has what feels like years of careless cleaning and a bit of neglect, which is a shame really! At first glance it appears clean. But then, when you look closer (or spend a few nights!), everything is covered in a layer of grime - the kind that comes from lack of deep cleaning. Bathroom is grimy and smelly, ants and pests abound in places that could very easily be caulked, the space under the bed and under the armoire is filthy, and, though the sheets, pillows and towels are thankfully clean, they are old. Very old. Towels are threadbare, and shed lint -they are literally falling apart. Pillows are that kind of lumpy",20,1142
" that is only achieved after years and years of use. Mattress has some loose springs. It's a shame really, because it has some amazing potential. But for the time being, there is better value to be had in Mazunte. A bit of love and a bit of investing in this place will go a very, very long way! :)",50,1142

"we had to wait a lot to enter the room after 17h when they finished cleaning the room. There were 2 filthy yellow towels with strange black spots and only a mini soap. The kitchenette only has 2 plates and 2 forks and you can not do anything with that. Also when it rains, the water leaks from all over the floor.",10,1144
"We arrived here after checking various hostals. I took a lot to find ""Fani"" who is the one taking care of the reservations.

As the terrace roof had a few holes from the last hurricane, she would gave us the room for 650 pesos and she assured that it was only a couple of holes in the terrace.   That same night rained and water started leaking all over the room. All the floor became a pool and the water was splashing the night table and part of the matress. And the walls and roof had the black marks of the filtrations, so, is not the",10,1144

Tiene estacionamiento. La atención de Reyna, Fanny y su esposo es excelente y buen precio también. Lo ÚNICO que no está tan padre, es que no venden desayunos o algo así, para poder aguantar en lo que uno baja al pueblo, pero me regalaron café riquísimo. Hay cocina y uno puede prepararse algo.

Each room is spacious and boasts its own personality. Accommodations are very clean, and there is an enjoyable open-air kitchen and dining area for those warm summer nights. Only minutes from the local beach. Highly recommended!",50,1147
"The Olivo suffers a bit from being some distance from both the ocean and the town centre (although for some people, this could be a plus because it is quiet apart from the birdsong).  However the warm welcome from Marco (who speaks English) and Roberta (only Spanish, apart from Italian) more than made up for this.  The dogs are friendly too!  The communal area around the kitchen is good for meeting both them and anyone else staying there.  My room was large, clean and mosquito-proof.  Not the cheapest around but relaxing and comfortable.  Down the hill, the nearest eatery is a somewhat overpriced place serving ""craft"" food.  Much better to go next door to the Cafecito, which serves wholesome Mexican fare and is completely devoid of pretensions.  The ocean at both Playas Mazunte",40,1147

I then was led up to my room which was absolutely beautiful and clean as well as very nicely decorated with views of the lush tropical gardens of the posada. There are also screens on all the windows meaning that you don't have to use the mosquito net over the bed. There is a powerful fan provided, but the room did not have soap or towels and the wifi router is not positioned to cover the rooms.  The kitchen is beautiful as well as the dining area allowing for guests to mingle.  Marco is helpful : he lent me a cable for my phone when mine broke and provided me with travel advice.

I actually extended my stay twice because it is such a lovely place. I definitely recommend staying there.",40,1148

We slept both in the dorm and the private room. It's very clean and comfortable. There is some hammocks in the garden. The kitchen is very useful. It's a very small hostel so you will feel at home! I would recommend definitely this hostel!! :) ",50,1148

Super nice place to escape from the daily routine. The manager is really caring and gives good recommendations too.  This part was exactly what I was looking for.  Sadly, the place is badly maintained. A lot of stuff is just badly repaired or not at all. The staff is disinterested and unmotivated.  Towels and sheets didn’t get exchanged until we asked for it 5 days in, and we ran out of toilet paper and drinking water several times. We also didn’t have hot water the first few days.  The worst part is the restaurant though. Some of the food was not edible, the dishes several times arrived with missing parts from the",30,1149

The hotel claims the breakfast is included but you just get a tiny bowl of fruit and yogurt, with super dry bread on the side (we even had to ask for this every time despite it supposedly being a part of the menu).  Good rooms, bad service and food. Overpriced.  Seems like there was a good concept originally, and now just runs for profit.",50,1149

The road up to Cocolia is pretty rough, but once you're there it's instant love. Chic, minimalist casitas. Each one totally private & open to stunning views. The casitas are efficient and feel cosy, even though one entire wall opens up to forest and views. No AC, which amazingly it doesn't even need. The design takes advantage of lovely cross breezes, so a fan is all you need. If you're looking for a place to escape & decompress, this might be it....",50,1149
"Coming late in the day to visit the ecoturistico we decided to stay here as it was getting late. Having stayed in many other places in Oaxaca, we can say this was outstanding. For M$750 we got an en-suite with two large beds, 2 minutes walking from the beach. We slept like babies and being able to enjoy the stars with almost (Mazunte is on the other side of the cliff) no light pollution is incredible. When we were there we left it late (to see the sunset on the beach), so there was no food left to get. But Mazunte is only a short drive away so that is not a problem (if you have your own car that is).",50,1150
"El La Ventanilla es un lugar idóneo para encontrar tranquilidad, alejado del bullicio de las ciudades y con el único sonido del mar.   Las instalaciones de las cabañas son perfectas para descansar después de un recorrido en los manglares de la comunidad, visitar en tu auto Mazunte (se encuentra a 10 minutos), Zipolite (se encuentra a 15 minutos) o Puerto Ángel (se encuentra a 25 minutos). Los cuartos y las camas están muy limpios, además que te dan suficientes toallas. Cuentan con un baño en cada habitación.

"Our stay at Celeste Del Mar was nothing short of brilliant. From the moment we booked, Siddhartha was so helpful and made every aspect of our stay as good as it could possibly be. We enjoyed going to sleep with the sound of the ocean in the background and waking up to sunrise walks along the beautiful Mermejita beach and sometimes seeing whales coming up for air in the distance.  The breakfasts are great and we enjoyed meeting other guests and sharing some nice conversations. I couldn’t recommend this place enough and I hope to return very soon. Thank you to siddhartha and the whole team.",50,1151
"The a la carte breakfast is delicious and it's fun to share a fruit platter and an egg dish with a partner! Had some of the best papaya ever, and one morning we ate roasted sweet pumpkin as a breakfast dish, absolutely fabulous. The location is perfect at the meeting of coastal forest and ocean, and the design of the cabins maintains really clean and healthy indoor air, with a cool nighttime airflow through the shady side windows. The team of hosts is amazing and helpful, with great stories to tell about the area. It felt almost like a family stay.",50,1151
"Celeste del mar Is a really comfortable place, the rooms are very clean, I loved that in the up part of my bungalow there was an open space with a perfect view of the sea. It's a quiet place, in the night you can hear the sound of the sea and it's really near to go walking. People was very nice, and kind every time we asked something, I recommend it hugely.",50,1151
"Celeste Del Mar is a cute place very close to the Mermejita Beach in Mazunte. If you are looking for a calm and quiet stay away from the main beach, this is a good choice. The superior rooms have a lofted area with a hammock and a beautiful view. The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating.",50,1151
"This is a really nice place, the owners are very nice and the service was excellent. However, it is too expensive. After 3 days, we moved to another equally charming place, but for half the price. We stayed in this place because it was ranked number 1 in TripAdvisor, but we regretted the decision because it was too expensive compared to other equally nice places in Mazunte.",30,1151
"These eco-bungalows are an intimate and lovely retreat only steps from the beach. Walking distance to Punta Cometa and town of Mazunte. Really clean, lovely accommodations with hammocks and beautiful details throughout. Great help from Siddhartha, the owner, and Abi. It was truly a magical and wonderful place to stay! The beach was beautiful and mostly unpopulated, the perfect place to watch the sunset. Hope to return soon and stay again!",50,1151
"We arrived for four nights and were greeted with a welcome beer, which was very welcome indeed. The room was rustic luxury. A good size and a hammock on a mezzanine that had a view of the ocean. The owner, on-site, and staff were always helpful and attentive. We had a little issue with a mosquito net, and it was replaced instantly. These people understand the concept of service and hospitality.",50,1151
"My room on the second floor of the bungalow was just gorgeous - I had all the light I wanted, the bed was perfect, and everything was super clean.  I liked the bathroom too - open, airy.  And the host provided shampoo and soap and good towels.  I also loved that the drinking water was provided in the room!  And the hammock upstairs in the room is just pure luxury.  I initially thought the place is right on the beach, but it is behind some other construction, about 15 steps from the beach. I was first disappointed about that but then quickly realized that it provided nice tranquility and the surf could be heard just as much throughout the day in the room - a beautiful sound to fall asleep to.   The waters of the Mermejita beach were not swim-able at this time of the year",50,1151
" (apparently the waves only come down from Dec to Feb), but the spectacular waves were amazing to watch. Again, at first I was sad I could not swim right next to my temporary home, but then was grateful for the beautiful waves show that took place every day.  I could sit on the beach chair for hours mesmerized. Especially since that meant that the beach was always empty!  Probably a very few places left like this in the world.  To get to the town, you need to hike up a hill by a cemetery and then schlep down, but it is not too onerous. And the host offered to take us there any time we wanted if he was around.  Taxi is also about USD 2.  We walked and even with the heat of the mid-day were doing fine.   Finally, the breakfast is convenient but nothing to write home about.  A bit of fruit, a bit of yogurt, an egg.  But it is good to have something in the morning and then eat more in the town.    I wish I stayed more than three nights and hope to return!",50,1151

I have stayed at Arigalan 3 weeks in May and had a great time there. I attended the modul 1 intensive yoga course at Hridaya Yoga. It is literally less than a 2 minute walk to the meditation hall from the bungalows and cabanas. Rose and her staff were wonderful and very helpful. I am already planning to return for a few weeks at the end of the year... can`t wait to be back there.,50,1152
". This an amazing place, a little slice of paradise on earth. Rose and her staff are amazingly gracious, kind and extremely helpful. Denisse offers a superb yoga class and is highly recommended reiki practitioner. The views are absolutely amazing, watching both sunrise and sunset from this hilltop gem.  Rooms are spotless and tastefully decorated and the bed is comfortable. Falling a sleep to the crashing of the ocean waves is idyllic.  Yoga workshops are scheduled throughout the year, we altered our plans to attend one and were not disappointed  If you are in Mazunte this the place to stay",50,1152
"Rose, the owner, and her great little team, are hard working and super helpful. The rooms and the premises are kept clean and the ambiance is quiet and peaceful. Great for meditation, yoga, or to just lay back and rest for a while. The dark room is also a great tool for that. The meals cooked by Rose, during such a retreat, are delicious and made according to your preferences. Full of delicate attentions overall. Recommended.",50,1152
Rose and her staff were absolutely gracious and kind! The hotel had an amazing view of the ocean and was close to a quaint little town called Mazunte. I stayed here because of the silent meditation retreat I attended and am already planning to return for a visit to relax. Thank you Rose for your kindness and hospitality!!,50,1152
I stayed here for a week and enjoyed every relaxing moment.  It is in an excellent location to walk to any beach or place in town.  The pool is covered and refreshingly cool after a hot day of bumming around.  I could not get enough of the ocean views and took countless pictures.  I slept with only the screen doors closed so I could hear the surf all night.  This hotel has a/c but I never used it because of the ocean breeze and sounds.  Highly recommend.,50,1152
"I have stayed at Arigalan several times (5) and have always been pleased with my stay.  I attend training and retreats at Hridaya Yoga and it is literally less that 3 minutes to the meditation hall from the bungalows and cabanas.   Rosa is always accommodating while I am in silence and understands what the teachings are all about, having attended retreats there herself.  The staff is most gracious and friendly.  I also like the fact that it is an adult only facility.  Being lulled to sleep each night by the sound of the ocean is one of the most peaceful and serene things I enjoy about Arigalan.  I will be returning to my little bungalow in the fall...can't wait!  Namaste'",50,1152
"I stayed with my mom at Hotel Arigalan for 5 nights, and our only complaint is that we weren’t able to stay longer. From start to finish, Rose and her staff were incredibly kind and thoughtful hosts. Rose could not have been a more accommodating host. We loved the location of Arigalan, with easy access to both Mazunte and San Augustinillo. The views from Arigalan are spectacular and there is easy access to the best swimming bay on San Augustinillo.",50,1152
"We spent a week at Hotel Arigalan and were very sad to leave. Rose is warm and helpful and her staff keep the rooms and communal areas beautifully clean. The hotel offers affordable, comfortable and clean accommodation. It is on a hill between San Augustillo and Mazunte, which is great, because you get a cooling breeze for your siesta and you can choose between two stunning beaches. I would highly recommend both the hotel and the area.",40,1152
"Had a great week plus here, staff were always helpful and rooms clean and comfortable, also has access to mazunte and San augustinilllo which is great so you can choose the quiet or louder town, was sad to leave",50,1152
"I spent 10 days in the daek room that the Arigalan Hotel offers for spiritual seekers. Rose, the owner, was extremely friendly feom the first moment we met. She let me cisit the room a couple of times before my retreat and get adjusted to it. The room is quiet and the service from the hotel excellent. On my request I was given 1 vegetarian meal per day. The food was extremely delicious and made my day :)  The room itself has everything need for a dark room retreat (shower, WC, AC, fan, a comfortable bed and space to practice yoga and meditate. It is also located just next to Hridaya Yoga.  My experience was fantastic and I hope so will be yours.",50,1152
"I just got back from an amazing stay at Las Almas and cannot wait to come back! Vlad is an incredible host with a great heart and energy, his house is gorgeous and the food is amazing (he even taught me how to make the sourdough bread they serve at breakfast).   I also met some incredible people there (friends of Vlad and guests) which made me feel at home and made my time in Mazunte even better. The rooms are super comfortable and beautiful, I felt like sleeping on a cloud. My stay would definitely have not been the same if I had stayed somewhere else. Vlad even took me to an incredible yoga class with him and was always taking care of me.   Vlad, I really hope to see you in Colombia soon. Thank you so much for your hospitality y todo el cariño.   PS. Regarding the location: I",50,1153
" would recommend to bring comfortable shoes since you have to walk about 10 minutes to get to the Mazunte beach. Although I would suggest to skip that beach and visit some of the others around Mazunte.   I definitely recommend Las Almas for your stay in Mazunte. Heaven on earth,",50,1153

"My 5 friends and I had the pleasure of renting out Las Almas for 3 weeks and we could not have had a better stay. We came to Mazunte for a yoga course and had our beautiful private escape at Las Almas overlooking the ocean. Everyday we watched the sunrise and sunset over the ocean and felt the cool breeze glide over our skin. we enjoyed breakfast each morning with tropical fruits, scrambled eggs, coffee and fresh vegetables. The 4 cabanas were perfect - extremely comfortable beds with little fans inside for extra comfort. Fell asleep to the sounds of nature and woke up to the sounds of birds and roosters. Extremely happy with our long stay here - highly recommend to groups of friends or families looking to rent out a larger space. The pool is ideal for night swims under the",50,1153

"My husband and I were so happy and comfortable at Las Almas. The grounds and rooms are beautiful and very well-kept, with gorgeous and thoughtful touches that surround you with beauty and serenity. The location is lovely, the views are incredible, and the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.  Vlad is the host with the most! He made us feel like we were visiting an old friend. His hospitality abounded throughout our stay. He made sure we had plenty to do, made arrangements for us to get massages at the hotel, took us snorkeling, invited us to yoga each morning, gave us recommendations, and more. The breakfast was sooo delicious (the chef is incredible!) and there was no shortage of cool drinks and tasty snacks when we were relaxing at the hotel. You will not be disappointed if you",50,1153

"As Lawrence Durrell wrote in the Quartet: « These are the moments which are not calculable, and cannot be assessed in words; they live on in the solution of memory, like wonderful creatures, unique of their own kind, dredged up from the floors of some unexplored ocean. ». My stay in Las Almas is one of these creatures for me.  But more pragmatically ;): - Awesome location, the bungalow are typical and also very clean. Very quiet place.  - Details are taken care of (water in the rooms, towels at the pool, cocktails…) - amazing homemade breakfast with a breathtaking view over the ocean - Vladimir is simply the best, he will be your guide through discovery and fun  « I’ll be back » Arnold Schwarzenegger - Terminator",50,1153
"Lugar ideal para una buenas vacaciones y tranquilas. El lugar es espacioso, habitaciones limpias con todo lo necesario. Personal amable. Tiene cocina compartida para preparar alimentos y comer ahi en una terraza muy bonita. Buenos precios.",50,1154
"I went for a drink and snack here. My bill was 115 however they didn’t have change for a 500 note, at this point they called the owner who was drinking there and said it was 350 min spend. It said on the board at the bottom of the steps but had been rubbed off on the board outside the restaurant and wasn’t mentioned when I arrived so I thought the first sign was old. My problem isn’t really with the money however, the owner was so rude and nasty to me I cried when I got back to my hotel. So far everyone in Mexico has been lovely and it’s been a joy to come here and experience such a beautiful place, but this was a really really awful experience.",10,1155
"Wonderful view, which alone would deserve a visit! Cocktails are great, especially those with mezcal, and the vibe is engaging. Food is also good, both main dishes and starters. This is one of the best restaurants in Mazunte. Definitely recommended. ",40,1155
"We were treated very rudely by the owner, demanding more tips. Despite the fact that we spent a lot of money there and were generous with the tips. The view was nice, but nothing else good to say about this place. Would never come back!",10,1155
"I came here for my birthday with my best friend. We stayed here for three nights, explored the beaches and Punta Cometa, the southernmost point of Mexico. I was surprised to read such aggressively negative reviews of the Copal, as my stay was blissful in every way. The staff was kind and attentive, without bothering you constantly, they even upgraded our room without charge.   Even though we were only two people, our bungalow had two floors, the first with a large bed and the second with two smaller beds, and on the porch, a delightful hammock from which you can rock yourself into the best nap of your life, lulled by the sweet smells and melodic sounds of the surrounding jungle. In essence, this place is a dream.   The bathrooms were great fun! This was my first eco-lodge so I",50,1155
" did not know what to expect regarding the toilet situation. Luckily, you have two options regarding the loo - a closed door room behind the restaurant, very private and out of the way of foot traffic, and a GLORIOUS throne, atop a structure, where you have a 360-degree view of the surrounding nature, complete with a clever and surprisingly odourless ""plumbing"" system where you sprinkle sand or water over your... ahem... business. I've never reviewed the loo-situation of any establishment before, but honestly... it is one of the perks of eco-lodges! Don't knock it 'til you try it, I say.   Fun Fact: Regular flushes use approximately 1 gallon of water, and are very wasteful.    The showers were also an adventure. While you do have the option to shower in closed, shower rooms, there is an open-air shower which is somehow also private. With strategically placed bamboo walls surround the perimeter around a one-wall shower ""room"", or area, more like, you can live your free-spirit fantasy. While washing away the sand that has settled in your bellybutton and anywhere else, you can spot all sorts of wildlife a few meters away. Of course, they won't actually be in the shower, but I still recommend you wear flip-flops, just in case. The water pressure is great and towels are provided.   Now, let's talk food! Delicious! Perhaps not a 5-star chef spread, but the mezcal more than makes up for it! We dined like queens, especially during breakfast. With a wide selection of fresh fruit and a wide variety of egg dishes, you can be sure to be fuelled up for your jungle beach explorations. There are also yoga classes available in a wonderfully peaceful wall-less room, so rain will not interrupt a class but rather, enhance the experience since the sound of natural showers can help with meditation.   All in all, a great 5-star stay. So good, it inspired me to start up a trip advisor account devoted exclusively to eco-lodges around the world. Watch this space. xx",20,1155

I love the view at this restaurant and have dined here before. But was very disappointed. The service was really not good. They forgot to place my order and i waited for over an hour to receive my dinner. ,10,1155
"This place was not at all what I expected to see. The staff was absolutely lovely and the ocean view from the restaurant is amazing. Other than that, the rooms were very simple and the windows are tiny, I ended up leaving and didn't stay a single night, however; i was charged a deposit and another night which is really upsetting. The location is hard to get to so I had to take a cab only to be disappointed by the place and turn around and order another cab into the city.   Llegue tarde porque hubo un accidente de trafico y el dueno fue muy grosero conmigo. NO me quede ahi ni una noche y me cobraron dos noches.

"This place is cute but so noisy all you can do is laugh. Right next to nightclub AND place where trucks are filling up with water all day long. Plus the roosters which I imagine are everywhere in Mazunte. We were there Dec 26-Jan 1 which is no doubt the noisiest time of the year, but still. and 4 glasses for a place that accommodates 8 people is a bit inhospitable, hippie vibe notwithstanding.",30,1156
"The place is really nice, full of vegetation.  it is situated in a really quite zone near the beach and the Main Street.  The rooms are cute and clean as well as the toilets.  The hosts are really kind and they make you feel really comfortable. You will feel like at home pretty soon.  The food is really good as well (if you like Mexican food you will love it). I really enjoyed my vacation there. I had the opportunity to meet really nice people, relax and party a little bit as well.  Perfect place for backpack travelers like me. ",50,1156

Recomiendo los desayunos y probar el café americano (con café de la costa oaxaqueña por supuesto). Tiene 4 habitaciones pequeñas pero muy cómodas, con baño propio, un mueble grande para poder instalarse y sacar la ropa de la maleta.

"This hotel only have three rooms and is located right on the beach. The included breakfast was great (Hot cakes, coffee and eggs). The room is a couple of stairs, with a private terrace and great view. We extended our stay because we loved it so much. There are not many tourists around and often your are all alone at this great beach.   One evening they arranged an outdoor movie screening where one could get dinner + beverage for 70 pesos.   The staff is very friendly and helpful, the only minus is that we did not have anyone cleaning our room during our three nights, would have been great to get rid of some sand.",50,1158
"It is located 2 blocks from the beach and right around the corner from great retaurants. The rooms are well sized and beds are confortable. The owner is very attentive and even offered to give us a ride no charge to the main road the day of our leave for us to catch a bus to our next stop.

I hope to be back very soon!",50,1160
"We stayed at Posada Ziga for two nights and loved its location on Playa Mazunte, close to shops, eateries, and Punta Cometa.   Checking in and out was very easy; everyone was kind and helpful; the room was clean and comfortable; the balcony offered a lovely view of the beach to the left and lush green hills to the right. We didn’t eat at the restaurant, so can’t speak to its quality, but it’s very nice to have drinks on a terrace with a view.  A few things made it a four-star, rather than five-star experience for us:  - not having AC was a little difficult -the room didn’t cool down even at night, so we used both the ceiling fan and the (pretty loud) floor fan all the time; - our balcony didn’t have hooks for a hammock, and the chairs were very hard to sit on; - serious",40,1160
" renovations were going on directly below us, and the noise made it impossible to relax in our room during the hottest time of day, so that at the end of two days, we were glad to change hotels.

They also have a restaurant were I ate from time to time. Beach is just in front of your nose.",40,1160
"Beautiful spot, right on the beach. If you're lucky as I was, you'll get a seaview balcony, which will make hard for you to leave the room at all. It wasn't very big, but it had two double comfortable beds with mosquito nets, and a nice bathroom. No hot water, but who needs it in that weather anyway?  Also, it's right at the end of the beach, so it's pretty quiet in there, and just a 5 minute walk to the other side of the beach, where most of the restaurants are. A special mention for the staff, really nice and helpful at all times, a 10 for them! The only thing they could improve a little: kitchen, it's ok, but nothing great, lots of better and cheaper options nearby, although the view from the table makes breakfast taste better. Also, they don't serve dinner. All in all, one",40,1160

The breakfast is a very nice touch. Rooms simple, but perfectly comfortable, and the garden is a very nice place to relax.",50,1161
"Mazunte is awesome and this place is nice and affordable option to stay in. They have dorms and private rooms, all equipped with mosquito nets. Mosquitos are terrible! Breakfast is included in the price (simple, but tasty with fruits, good coffee and cereals). 2 minutes walking from the beach and 5 minutes from colectivo stop.  The guys, managing the hostal, are super friendly. Always have a good advice about Mazunte. They took us to the sunset spot (beach) for nice views and evening swimming. Strongly recommend.",50,1161
"Very nice spot to chill and meet new people, & literally a two minute walk from the beach. Mazunte was magical and the girls running the hostel were very sweet. Only downside was when they more than doubled the prices for current guests during the free music festival - about $20 usd for a bunkbed...",40,1161

You only need 5 minutes to the beach and maybe 8 minutes to the village of Mazunte. My cabana was very comfortable (big enought, with Bathroom & toilet, fan and mosquito net, there is only cold water, but it’s so hot in Mazunte that you really don’t need hot water :D ) I had everything that I needed, and the place was very clean (they clean the rooms every day) and it was a great value for the money.

I have been visiting here since 1996 Mazunte a special energy noted Miramar is minutes walking to everything you would want on a retreat to re-energize your internal battery. The Ordonez Family will treat you to whatever your adventurous heart desires. Punta Cometa ask for the Jaccuzzi  you will always remember and if your into fishing they will connect you.  ,40,1162
"The price is not cheap but worth the view from your private balcony. The room/bed is clean but not spotless, the bathroom could have been cleaner... Cold shower,fan,mosquito net,wifi. It was quite hot during night inside of the mosquito net even with the fan on,but the mosquito net is a must even when wearing bug spray... We slept with doors and windows open which gave us lots of nice breeze from the sea. And with doors and windows open during sleep, we didnt encounter any safety problem. The path leading to Punta Cometa is nearby, and there are signs to follow to easily reach the vista where the views are breathtaking.",40,1162
"We stayed there for two nights and enjoyed it. It is a good price for the amazing view, the rooms are very basic but clean. It is all about the view! It is also nice to be away from the main street, where all the other hotels are. The owners are nice, the place is safe and again the view is awesome! Great for a few days.",40,1162
"Although family friendly, this hotel has a fun and friendly staff that have great tips on where to go out at night. I highly recommend the Mezcaleria and small palapas that are both less than a 5 minute walk from this beautiful hotel.",50,1163
"Had a great time at Las Flores. It's close to both beaches, punta cometa and central Muzante. The rooms and pool are lovely, as pictured. The real winner was meeting Carlos and his team. They made us feel very welcome and made sure we had a really fun trip. ",50,1163
"Laura, the manager, is great. All the staff were very attentive. There is home-made taste breakfast available in a very affordable price. It is located minutes away form the turtle museum, beach and Punta Cometa. There is also a massage available with a good eco-view.",50,1163
"I've spent with my wife 2 nights in our honeymoon. Rooms are very nice and spacious, everything worked perfect. Staff was almost invisible, the room cleaning was ok but we didn't have anyone for asking anything, even we left the keys to no one in the reception. May be this happened because we stayed during 24 and 25 of December, however wasn't good. Internet connection wasn't good enough at our room.",40,1163
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. In fact, we arrived at 5am and were welcomed in and shown to bed, no problems, no extra price - so 3.5 nights.  It's well located, 5 mins walk to Mazunte beach (right) or 5 mins walk over the hill to San Agustin (our favourite) left.  The garden and bungalows are thoughtfully designed and lovingly kept. At the moment, the garden is blooming in colour and teaming in wildlife - the butterflies are stunning. The pool is a tinge of green around the edges, but was cleaned daily and actually very warm and enjoyable to use.  Our room was slick and modern with concrete walls, en suite, comfortable white bedding, but with rustic thatched roof and clay walls. It was cleaned daily. We didn't recieve any hot water but given the temperature there,",40,1163
" we wouldn't have used it anyway. At night, the bungalows seem to trap the heat so perhaps request the higher rooms to catch a breeze. Even with 2 fans, we struggled to sleep through the heat, despite the best efforts of the staff to accommodate us.   Wifi wasn't available in our room, we had to walk up the steps and wave out devises around, which wasn't ideal, but an insignificant detail in the scheme of things. Perhaps because it is quiet, breakfast also wasn't available here (though there clearly is a restaurant area for busier times) - but there are some lovely cheap, breezy options a short walk away on the beach.  Overall, very friendly proprietor, beautifully maintained little place a short walk from the beach. FYI/ We paid 350pesos for a taxi to the airport.",50,1163
…,50,1163
"As the whole town is quiet right now, so is the hotel. We shared the pool with a Mexican family from DF and we all tried our language skills out. The 2nd floor rooms are lovely and airy with great balconies, aka - Robinson Caruso style. Great for cocktails and a breeze. The resturant is not open as it's so quiet there, so be prepared to walk down the road to find something. No shortage of resturants however, we would recommend this hotel and would stay again. ",50,1163
This is a very nice place if you want to stay in Mazunte. You have to walk like 5 minutes to get to the beach but still is a very comfortable place. The people there will make everything they can to make your stay the best. The rooms are nice and clean. There's no TV and the wifi is not so good. The pool is nice surrounded by tropical gardens (be sure to pack some mosquito repellent because you will need it) and at nights you can listen the ocean. You won't regret staying here! And it is a pet-friendly hotel!,50,1163
the place is wonderful even if your are not  in front of the ocean. just 5 minuts walking from the beach you can find a beautiful tropical garden sourrounding the rooms and a nice little swimming pool. the road to arrive is not the best but don't warry when you will arrive you will be very happy of your choise. the staff is nice and available. I strongly recommend this place,40,1163
"I stayed at Posada Mazuntinas for a week in mid-January.  We had the Sky Casita which is up a few flights of stairs, but David, the host, transported our luggage (a very nice surprise!).  The Sky Casita is one indoor room and one open-air room with a kitchen - the open air and location made it feel a bit like a treehouse.  The frig was huge and the kitchen very well equipped with drinking water included (refills only US$1).  I was worried about not having air-conditioning, but the powerful ceiling fans made it very comfortable to sleep.  David, the host, gives a wonderful orientation to Mazunte, all the best restaurants (and there are plenty of good ones to choose from), warnings about which beaches are swimmable and which are not, as well as the best options for things to do",50,1164
" while in town.  Don't miss the sunrise from the rooftop - it rises over the ocean, you're situated above the tree-line and it is really worth it. The casita was very clean and the staff is very friendly.  Overall, I highly recommend this place.  If you don't want to do the stairs, there are other options on the property.",50,1164

"We spent the month of January 2016 in the Mazunte area.  We stayed at the Posada las Mazuntinas in the beginning of January and then again at the end of January because we liked it so much.  We stayed first in the cabana at the top of the hill.  It has a full kitchen, living area open air.  The bedroom and bathroom is enclosed.  There is mosquito netting surrounding the bed and fans to keep you cool.  We were very pleased and enjoyed our stay so much that we rented again at the Posada.  David and Tiki are excellent hosts and went out of their way to give us useful information about the area, including the restaurants and sights to see.  The posada is only a 5 minute walk to the Rinconcita beach and a short walk to the restaurants.  Although we did cook in our in the cabana, ",50,1164
" there are lots of places to eat in town.  We enjoyed eating out at the ""cinnerante"". (dinner and a movie at different restaurants in town).  There is internet available in the cabanas, though the town's internet service is slow at certain times during the day.  We had no problem connecting.  We would not hesitate to stay there again.",50,1164
…,50,1164
"I spent four months in the cabana pictured here. It was wonderful. David and Tiki are warm friendly hosts and always there when you need them. If you go missing, as I did when I took off for a few days exploring without telling them, they get concerned and that is very comforting to someone traveling alone. I had everything I needed to be self sufficient for my stay and when something wasn't just right, David was on it asap. I found the village of Mazunte to be the quiet, laid back place you hear about. It does come to life a bit over the News Years and Easter celebrations. The beaches are spotless but at times a bit scary for this poor swimmer. Walk to the next village of San Agustinillo where you will find, most days, a sheltered bay for great swimming. Although I did most of",50,1164
" my own cooking, there are lots of places to eat in town and even more during any holiday times. Never tired of the many trails and roads with great views. I would highly recommend a stay in any of their cabanas whether for a night or two or the entire winter.",50,1164
…,50,1164
"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at Los Mazuntinas for a week and it was incredible. David gave us a welcoming and thorough introduction upon our arrival and left us with an intuitive map of the town and plenty of restaurant suggestions. Our bungalow was the perfect size for us! We had a mosquito net for around our bed, a 5 gal tank of potable water, a mini fridge, fresh towels everyday and even a bucket of water outside our door to rinse our sandy feet off after a day at the beach. The hammock was perfect to read in even on rainy mornings. Mazunte is truly a hidden gem and we are so grateful that we had the opportunity to experience its nature, its people and its culture. We would (and will!) recommend Los Mazuntinas to any and all who are traveling to Mazunte and",40,1164
"The room was good for the price; the views are amazing, overlooking the ocean.  Handy to have the restaurant open from 7.00 to 19.00. The staff and owners could be nicer and smile from time to time though...",30,1165
"Very unstable energy ovethere! Host are either kind of happy or very irritable! You don’t feel at all as a customer overthere! All you request and need are very not welcome ! You have to repeat it at least 3 times if you have a request simple as having a coffee in the morning, broom your room, etc! They only clean bathroom once a day! Kind of disgusting! And please do not eat there! All of us have been sick because it’s very not well clean! And if you wanna make a temexcal with the owner Emeliano be ready to handdle with a drunk guy that make you do weird things not part of the tradition! If you are sensitive to energy, I do not recommend ",10,1165
"The owner Emiliano was pissed drunk many times, having a very disturbing energy, screaming at me concerning money, leading completely inappropriate Temaxcal, leaving the ceremony many times for over 20+ mins. His wife Faye did an excellent job cooking for us and helping us overall. Maintenance serive was not sufficient. Toilets missing paper many times. Most people got sick during their stay, we don't know why. Best thing about the place is the view and the kids.",10,1165
"The views and the atmosphere are great. it’s not that far, a 5-7min slightly uphill walk from the main street or the beach. The private room we had was very nice, comfy bed with ok mosquito net, a fan and a great view. The bathrooms were good and as clean as possible in this dusty environment. The kitchen was kind of basic. Overall, the views & the atmosphere make it. Would recommend it to people who don’t have higher expectations, then it’s good value. It’s a bit alternative & eco, we liked it.",40,1165
"Cute, simple cabanas that suit the environment, nestled up high on the point with the most incredible view. We had a cabana for a few nights right on the edge of the cliff, so woke up and rolled outside into the hammock to take in the view every morning. The steps down to the ocean were on our doorstep. Emiliano was welcoming and answered all of our questions. He will organise meals and taxi rides for you if you need, just check all the pricing when you ask. This is a very laid back place so you need to be proactive and ask for what you want and you'll find the locals are happy to accomodate. We wandered down the hill each morning and grabbed these chocolate banana bread rolls from the bakery halfway down - I can't remember what they're called but they were the absolute best!!",40,1165
" This is a super relaxed, small beach town and we were there in the low season so very chilled and quiet vibe. There's a couple of great places to eat and drink throughout your days; the healthy cafe right on the beach had the yummiest salads. We were mostly swimming and lazing about, but yoga and turtles also seem to be attractions of this place! Highly recommend a visit to this little haven, it was a great escape and Balamjuyuc was the perfect location to enjoy it.",50,1165
…,30,1165
Spontaneous trip to Mazunte turned out to one of the most memorable places and time.  Specially because of this location. Emiliano makes you feel welcome. So friendly staff. Beautiful cabanas. Nice and clean. All you need. All perfect. Thank you. ,50,1165
"The Cabanas are located on a beautiful hill just above the bay of Mazunte. There are stairs down to the beach, which you reach in about 5 minutes. We had a shared room with 4 beds in a wooden cabana, simple, but with a ventilator, hammock and mosquito nets. The view from our terrace was incredible. The only handicap is the owner: He didn't really explain anything to us when we arrived. So we also didn't know that you have to pay for the Mezcal sauna (in the end they didn't charge us) also the shared kitchen wasn't really organized and clean.",10,1165
"I had an 100% positive experience staying at Balamjuyuc. The cabin had the best view of the ocean. Great balcony for watching the ocean and eagles flying by and for practicing yoga. I loved my bed, it was cozy and it was right by the window. All I had to do to see the sunrises in the morning was to open my eyes. The cabin is simple, but very cozy.  Bathrooms and showers were always clean. Communal kitchen is a bonus. The location is superb. It is outside of the busy area of Mazunte and is just a short walk down the hill to all the shops and restaurants. As for Wifi, don't expect to find a perfect signal anywhere in Mazunte. Wifi at Balamjuyuc was pretty good and reliable, better than in most places that I have tried in the village.  Emiliano is such an awesome guy. We made",10,1165
"Great place to go if you’re looking to be caught in a scam.  First of all, the place is located 10 min away from the beach, which is a bummer. You have to walk through a really steep dusty road to get to a beach that you cant even swim in.  The owner told me that there was a construction finishing in the kitchen area, but that she would make up for it with a discount. Every morning we woke up with construction noise, and workers talking loudly, however since we had the discount we were ‘fine’ with it.  It wasnt SO bad also because we had beautiful breakfast every morning which we thought was included -as it was CLEARLY printed in the room rules and was also implied by the owner. No one ever talked about breakfast prices. At the end of our stay, the ladies that work there told me",10,1166
" that the breakfast fee had to be payed in cash. I was si surprised!  I called the owner and told her that no one ever talked about the breakfast being extra, nor did we ever see a price list or a manu. Also, i sent her a picture of the room rules where it clearly stated that it was included.  She THREATENED ME WITH CALLING THE POLICE AND SEIZE MY THINGS IF I DIS NOT PAY IN FULL.  Obviously she didnt accept the mistake. We proceeded to pay because SHE WAS GOING TO CHARGE THE COST OF HER MISTAKE TO HER EMPLOYEES -sweet hard working people that had nothing to do with it. She told me that for breakfast to be included she had to charge the full price of the room; at the end of the day the discount was a bluff. We payed 150 dollars worth of breakfast for two days. Ridiculous.",10,1166

"Nous avions réservé par bowling une ""cabane de luxe"". A notre arrivée on a tenté de nous loger dans un trou à rats. Il a fallu menacer de partir et demander le remboursement pour que l'on nous donne une cabane à peu près conforme à notre réservation.  Au bout de trois jours, le ménage n'étant pas fait,  nous avons réclamé. On nous rétorqué qu' il n'était pas inclus dans le prix et qu'il fallait payer 100 pesos par passage. Nous avons refusé et obtenu finalement gain de cause. La salle de bains est extérieure et minimaliste. Le lieu est encombré de détritus et de gravats de chantier. La plage, très proche, est souillée de cacas de chiens et, de plus, non baignable à cause du courant. Bref, à fuir. Pas loin vous trouverez d'autres cabanes, à peine plus chères et bien plus",10,1167

Conozco muy bien al propietario que siempre ha respondido a sus 50 solicitudes.  Usted pidió cambiar la luz lateral.  pediste una caja fuerte que el hotel te compró para satisfacerte y así sucesivamente.  saliste como un salvaje gritando a los niños porque se estaban divirtiendo frente a tu casa.  el propietario no entró en su habitación, su puerta no estaba bien cerrada.

"Bendita Luna es un nuevo hotel en Mazunte. Es un espacio muy lindo, está bien pensado, las habitaciones son cómodas y espaciosas, la decoración del lugar es linda. Está planteado para el autoservicio en la cocina y áreas comunes pero hay personal que hace las habitaciones todos los días. Estuve poco tiempo pero me gustó. Está bastante metido en el camino al pueblo así que no hay que tener problema con caminar y poder convivir con los sonidos de los animales locales que viven en los terrenos contiguos.",40,1169

There's a generous covered porch on the 1st floor and shared kitchen for 4 units. Spectacular views of the ocean from all rooms. There's a great low key vibe about the town that makes you want to linger. No shoes required at this place.  The owners were lovely. We'll be back.",50,1170
"La predisposición del staff, la ubicación y la tranquilidad hacen que recomiende este lugar. Sin dudas se nota una clara ausencia del encargado de tomar decisiones.

"If you’re the sort of person who wants to stay right on the beach and doesn’t shower much then this is an ideal place for you.  The good stuff: There’s two rooms above the restaurant with a private deck overlooking the sea where you can whale watch. The WiFi works well and the staff are so chilled they don’t really care what you do. The less good stuff: One room has a basic, grimey bathroom with a toilet which might not flush and instead of a door there’s a tiny, thin curtain whose only purpose appears to be decorative. The other room doesn’t have a shower so best to use the sea.  The rooms aren’t clean but hey, it is what it is. Plus it’s like 100 pesos per person and you’re free to just enjoy the beach. ",30,1173
"Nice hotel and restaurant by the sea. They offer good food and activities. I have to say you must speak spanish there. The wifi only works at the restaurant and not in the rooms. They offer laundry service, but then again, it helps if you speak spanish.",40,1173
"The staff seemed very annoyed at customers, for both the restaurant and hostel. Wifi usually doesnt work either. Rooms are not cheap, and sleeping in a hammock is not great, they do not provide mosquito nets. I recommend the other end of the beach to find much better places.",10,1173

"Estuvimos una semana acampando bajo su palapa. Es una posada-restaurante muy familiar. El personal es atento y servicial. Es todo muy sencillo pero correcto.

"L’accueil est efficace et le proprio est sympa. La chambre que nous occupions était grande, bien ventilée, mais sombre. Très propre. Le petit déjeuner, inclus dans notre tarif, était correct mais sommaire. L’hôtel est situé sur la rue principale, à l’entrée de Mazunte. Le village est petit . On peut tout faire à pied.

Hotel DF got my attention as it is right next to the beach, it looks modern and well maintained. So I went over there to get some information about prices etc. but the staff there did not seem to be interested to give information or aquire new customers. They only handed me a paper with their email address and told me write an email (which I thought was a bit weird as I already have been there to get first-hand sights of the hotel...).  Nevetheless I wanted to check the prices and whether they have rooms available in April 2016. But unfortunately my first impression of a",20,1177
 dissappointing service has been right: It took three emails (in about three weeks) from my side until they answered. They responded that they have free rooms and gave me the prices. I was excited to finally get attention from them but after asking how I could book a room I am still waiting for an answer for over a week now.  I finally decided to not waste my money on a hotel that maybe looks nice but apparently offer a miserable service especially keeping in mind their high prices. I booked now another hotel where they know what customer service really means.  From my experience I would not recommend anyone to stay at Hotel DF.,50,1177

I arrived in a huge thunderstorm that went on and off for a couple of days, but still really enjoyed those days hanging out with other travellers at La Isla.  Stayed upstairs in the large dorm room. Some of the beds are just mattresses on the floor and the mosquito nets have holes - but in Mazunte you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere that doesn't, especially at La Isla prices.  Free breakfast (scones and fresh fruit and juice and coffee) + free wifi (quite weak but you're on the beach, yknow?). Hostel sells beautiful fresh smoothies and other drinks which are perhaps a bit pricey compared to other Mexico prices but still damn good on a hot day at the beach.

They were rude when I mentioned that I had called before and they just turned us away saying that there are many other places we could stay.",50,1179

"This is the most special place I've been to, right by the beach. You can't beat the price, even for a private room, which is what we had. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, our room was very cozy and clean, and you get a free continental breakfast; they buy their coffee in town, and it's some of the best I've had in Mexico to-date (not included, but what's 15 pesos?!). Also, La Isla had some of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever encountered, and in the 10 days we were there, there was never not any toilet paper (as a female, I'm really picky about clean toilet seats and available paper; this has both). Last but not least, despite the colorful array of people passing through here, and mainly younger world travelers, it never got too loud past the self-imposed quiet",50,1179

We found a lot more than what we expected and we are thinking about coming back already.",50,1179

Everything was fully booked, and we had to camp during the first 2 nights, but the staff at Cabañas Abril were really helpful and managed to find us a room. We stayed in the cabañas during 4 nights, and it was a very good value for money. The place, as everything in Mazunte, is very very basic, but they manage to have all the basics in order. The place is clean, safe, and the price is decent. You do not need more in Mazunte.

"We passed this hotel a few times while in Mazunte and liked it for the nice fusion of a modern concept while maintaining a local touch with the palm leaf hatched roofs. We believe that places like this are important to keep the laid-back flair of this magic village and to offer a more upscale experience. We stayed at another rustic place but after a few very hot nights we looked for something more centric and definitively cooler. When I found the Cabañas Sicarú on booking.com and saw it had air conditioning it was a clear case. The communication was quick and uncomplicated  for a special wish, so we were looking forward to our cool rooms - and the rooms are not only temperature cool, but all have an individual cool touch. When we later met the owner it became clear that we had",50,1181
"Nice, clean two storey beachfront apartments with an amazing view on a beautiful strech of the bay. A clean pool for guest only and a restaurant with a small menue. The staff is friendly. We had a very plesant stay and will come again. There is dog poo on the beach, altough just on the public beach, not on the compound.",50,1182
"Six cabanas on a hill overlooking the ocean. No onsite management, just a surly caretaker. We had booked 2 nights on Expedia. We liked Mazunte and wanted to stay one more night. Our cabana was available online but we could not book it because of  a 2-night minimum. So we asked the caretaker. He checked, and told us okay.  We returned from the beach after sunset in wet swimsuits, looking forward to a shower, to relax, and then go to dinner. Instead, we found that the caretaker had crammed all our things into our suitcases and removed them from the room, and he was barring the door! He said it was rented to someone else. I suspect he failed to note it as occupied, and someone else booked it online.  We had a very difficult time finding another room because the town was completely",10,1183
 full. My companion searched online while I tramped the neighborhood. I finally found something by sheer persistence - I returned to a place that had already turned me down and they dug up a little room they don’t usually rent.  And you can bet the surly caretaker did not help carry our suitcases down the 135 steps to the street.  AVOID this hotel!,40,1183

"The hotel is located against a steep mountain, looking at the sea. Spacious, clean and modern “ecological” rooms....(you know what that means, right? No AC!) But the architect thought about the heat!! So he constructed those rooms with two “walls” with wooden blinds.... very nice looking, but without any moskito net...., so any crawling or flying insect can join in! And there’s no wind blowing!! So forget about natural cooling. So, someone thought about it, and put 2 fans in the room... it is so spacious, that they’re not enough.... and to top it all, to avoid being bitten by moslkitos or something worse... the beds are covered with a white gauze ( so you enter into your cocoon..... but that gauzze is so heavy, that does not allow any air into your bed space! One night I",30,1183
" preferred to sleep in the outside hammok! The restaurant is floors upstairs...or downstairs! It depends where your room is..... with a magnificent cook, and view! But frankly, the amount of stairs that you have to climb up and down, just to est or swim at the pool... is to much!",30,1183

"Not a single place on this planet, let alone Mexico, would dare to treat paying customers the way these guys do. Total desmadre, chaos, complete ignoring of common sense or any business deal they make with you. Their only focus is making money, and they won't stop at ripping you off while providing ZERO care for you, and complicating your life with non-stop inconvenience. The place itself is lovely, but definitely not worth its price, and the owners are greedy, disrespectful people. Do not get involved with this place.",30,1183
"As said in other comments... the place is amazing, but maybe a bit overpriced considering the service. We arrived quite late (6pm) hoping to be able to enjoy a cocktail and the sunset. After we climbed the 150 stairs with no way to communicate with the staff to get some help, we actually enjoyed the amazing view ... from the lobby, for more than an hour. Staff was not warned that we had booked a room, so the room was not ready, and they really struggled to find our reservation... We were asked several times for proof of payment, which is not the kind of greeting you expect when booking a premium place. I must highlight that the staff was really nice and willing to help, the problems seem to steam from management issues.  The architecture really is impressive, and the view",50,1183
" compares to nothing else in mazunte. The room did not have all the mentioned features but staff brought it when we asked for it (music, etc). The view from cuarto triangulo is ashtonishing, you'll never want to leave the place.  The pool was not really clean either, but ok to swim. For the price you'd expect a little more of attention on these details.  Contrary to other comments below, i must say the personal in charge was very decidated, he cooked us breakfast, brought us hot water for the night since it was a bit chilling outside, came to the room with drinks and guacamole..   Last but not least, the good surprise of being able to pay with a credit card was swiped out by a late e mail, one week after having left... i'm being asked  to deposit the amount again.. considering I have paid and left a consequent tip,  where is my money gone?   Let's say, this a closer to an airbnb with extra attention than to a hotel or a BnB, since you'll lack service and details.",50,1183
…,50,1183
"Great place! This is such good value for money if you share for two people, as Mazunte is pricier than you think.  The views are just incredible, well worth being so far uphill. The pool is always clean and the staff are just so friendly and will help you with anything. Speaking Spanish will help as they do not speak much English.  Fully recommend to stay here. Also close to Punta Cometa where you can see the most amazing sunset.",50,1184
"We made a reservation to stay at OceanoMar for 3 nights with the understanding that the hotel had air conditioning, as indicated on Trip Advisor. When we arrived, we discovered that the rooms do not, in fact, have air conditioning.  Whether this miscommunication was the fault of Trip Advisor or of the hotel, I cannot say. However, I am glad that we had not put down a deposit, and I wish that Trip Advisor had accurate information about the facilities at OceanoMar. I was really looking forward to staying there and disappointed that Trip Advisor painted a completely false picture of this beautiful hotel.",30,1185
"We truly enjoyed our stay at OceanoMar. It was very family friendly (kids 10 & 13) with a great pool and a restaurant on site. We did have to get two rooms for the four of us, but the cost was still quite reasonable. The view is magnificent! Staff was super friendly and helped us with transportation and tours.  It is walkable to town with a coffee shop at the bottom of the hill where one can grab a frappe or drink.  The rooms were very comportable with windows that allowed for a good breeze and a small patio. It is nicely appointed with plenty of storage, a desk/table, and a lovely shower.  Communication prior to stay was great!! I highly recommend OceanoMar for the rooms, amenities, location, but most of all the wonderful people there!",50,1185
"If the owners spent just a bit more it would be fantastic. The setting and view is gorgeous. the rooms are nice and with not much effort they would be perfect. place needs a little upkeeping. Staff (of 2) is very helpful and amicable, but they are gone by 3 pm. Finished your  water bottle and Need  more water...walk at least 10 mins on dirt road up and down a hill to get some. We changed rooms, the small one is tiny, the suites are much better. Housekeeping takes forever to clean your room and watch for your beach towels, you will use them every day. If you leave them out, theyll be in the same place all week. Breakfasts are good but the kitchen needs some cleaning asap. ",30,1185
"It really is paradise here So relaxing by the pool with a lovely view The en-suite room was big,clean and comfy The food was magnificent Note there is no wood fired pizza oven The staff were incredibly helpful and thank you Dorian and Lydia The guests seemed to mix well Be aware if you struggle to walk you will need a taxi to get you to and from from Mazunte The taxis are cheap and readily available",50,1185
"We traveled to Mazunte with our 4-year-old son to relax in the warmth and visit with lifelong friends who return to the town every winter-- this year their usual rental house was not available so they stayed at OceanoMar, and of course it was the natural choice for us too.  It couldn't have been more perfect! Our room was lovely and spacious, our king bed was very very comfortable, our private balcony with hammock perfect for lazy afternoons, and the view of Merimahita beach was breathtaking. Every morning we saw humpbacks or orcas from the restaurant. Yes you can hear the wonderful, glorious ocean at all times-- definite bonus! Dorian, Letitia, Lidia and staff made us feel so comfortable, and it really was like a home... the food was always delicious-- try the vegetarian",50,1185
" lasagna!!  -- and prepared with a smile. My son spent hours a day in the gorgeous and well-maintained  pool, it was easy to monitor him in the shallow wading section, and he's come home a bona-fide swimmer as a result.  The staff let us borrow a corner of the fridge for leftovers and kid snacks which was much appreciated. We spent many lovely evenings visiting and playing cards up at the restaurant after hours with the baby monitor set up, and not a care in the world. I would go back in a heartbeat!",50,1185

"My wife and I just returned from a two week stay at OceanoMar.  We have traveled a great deal in Mexico but this was our first time in Mazunte.  We were thrilled to find this small seven room intimate gem of a hotel located in a beautiful setting.  OceanoMar reminded us of other places in the world that we had been to thirty years ago. It was so wonderful to find a place that was so charming and had not experienced the kind of over-development one sees in so many places.  The rooms are beautiful and from our private terrace we could see humpback whales, dolphins, and lots of birds. The hotel has a lovely dining area with a panoramic vies of the sea. They have a great pool with a view of the beach. The food served in the restaurant is excellent. The coffee served in the am is",50,1185
" really good.  For my wife and I what made OceanoMar so special was the hotel staff.  Dorian the hotel manager with his team of Ledia, Lety, and Zoila were so fantastic in making us feel like this was our home away from home.  Dorian also arranged for my wife and I to get massages in our room from Nancy.  OMG was she ever fantastic.  I can't say enough good things about OceanoMar. It truly is an amazing place.  We have booked our return visit for this fall.",50,1185

"Great Accommodation We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Casa Tierra Viva. Patti and her husband  were great hosts who were very welcoming and intent on making our stay comfortable.   The room was very clean and comfortable with 2 great beds and pillows. The air conditioning was a great asset.   We were pleased to have access to a full sized firdge and a fully equipped kitchen and fresh coffee each morning.  This little gem  is only 100 metres from the beach  and a short walk to restaurants, and stores for groceries etc and very close to a great bakery!  We would definitely stay there again. Mazunte is a great place to chill and have a relaxing beach holiday with a great variety of restaurants and good food! We would choose one of the 5 or 6 different beach restaurants each day,",50,1186
 and order drinks and breakfast or lunch right on the beach. No need to rents chairs or umbrellas. Now that is what I call a holiday. The boat tour to see whales and dolphins and turtles was definitely worthwhile but be sure to apply lots of sunscreen.,50,1186
…,50,1186
"The Casa Mazunte Tierra Viva is a work in progress, meaning they are in process of building a restaurant, pool, lounging area and adding some character. However, it is already a very nice place to stay.  Our room was large, clean with a very large window that kept the room bright (but not hot thanks to the shade).  Very quite property and air-conditioning available if needed.    This is one of the best situated hotels in Mazunte.  It is located just off the main road that takes you to Playa Rinconito.   The beach, the best restaurants,  and the road to Punta Cometa are all a few steps away.  The communal kitchen was also a nice perk and good opportunity to meet other friendly travelers.    Staff is also very friendly and accommodating. I would stay here again and look forward to",50,1186

"We loved staying here. The location is perfect - two blocks from the beach. It is close to EVERYTHING and if there is something you can't find, the owners live on-site and are very accommodating (they even bought us flan:)  Our room was large and with a well-equipped kitchenette. The bed is comfortable. The  hosts are fantastic people and I have no hesitancy in recommending this site.",50,1186
"Patti and her spouse were great hosts who were very responsive to any issues that came up during our stay and went out of their way to make our stay very comfortable.They were also very helpful in orienting us to what to do and where to eat. The room was comfortable with a great bed and pillows and very clean. The kitchen was well equipped with the essential necessities including a blender for smoothies etc. Their place is very conveniently located to beach, restaurants, and stores for groceries etc and very close to a great bakery! Would definitely stay their again. Mazunte is a great place to chill and have a relaxing beach holiday with a great variety of restaurants and good food! ",50,1186
"Patty and Arturo were very welcoming, helpful and speak very good English. We were impressed by her interest in our opinions on ways they might improve things. The room is quite large with a kitchen, table, bed and two additional seating/sleeping areas. The kitchen is well stocked and includes a coffee maker and blender. They also provide kitchen basics such as salt, coffee, oil, and sugar. Small terrace out back has no view but does have a hammock shaded by trees. Good wifi, and the recycling system, free purified water and hose to clean sand off your feet were nice touches. No A/C but cement building stays reasonably cool and with fans and screened windows/patio door you can get a cross-breeze. We didn’t find it hot at all.  Only a couple blocks off the best section of beach",50,1186

Great job definitely will be back.  CK",50,1187
This location has everything you want or need. Activities for adults and kids. Multiple hot tubs.  Great staff!!!  Resturant food and service all extraordinary.

"When I tell you that we have been to Grand Solmar Rancho San Lucas a lot in the past two year, I am not joking.  To the point where my husband bought a four bedroom so we couldn't go four times a year.  We have been to Rancho four times in the past year.  Each time getting better and better.  Ivan is the best first face to see when we step out of the car. Our last trip was just my husband, myself and our youngest son.  A shout out to my FAV activities peeps Lupita, Itzel and Daniel.  Love playing cards with Lupita every day, my son loves painting pottery (we will pick it up in July), the water balloon fight was AWESOME and the kids night (drop off at 5:00pm and pick up at 8:30pm ALSO AMAZING as we got alone time!

" missed Boltizar being with us during the days, but so happy he came to visit us a few times!!! We had Gim (sp), like the Gym but that isn't how you spell it. HE WAS AWESOME!!! He took care of us EVERYDAY from 11:00am until we went back to our room.  Always on top of everything we needed, his service could not have been better.  Let's talk restaurants... So if you go back to my review from March 2021 we found a GEM named Dorian.  We had one bad meal told him about it, and for the rest of the trip he made sure EVERY SINGLE MEAL WAS INCREDIABLE... Same for May 2021, and August 2021.  This time we went we immediately asked for Dorian, he was moved from GM of food and beverage to the GM of room service. WHAT?! It made ZERO sense to us, BUT I will say room service is of course NOW AMAZING!!!! Even as the GM of room service Dorian stopped to see us and still made sure each and every meal was AMAZING... We only ate out two nights (Picaro - good but it was the first night of a new menu wasn't my fav...) Edith's never a bad meal there.  Everyone at Rancho is AMAZING, the service is always AMAZING, it was just a little different. Our room was AMAZING, the view was AMAZING. Had a massage it WAS AMAZING, the woman who booked it was also so nice and kind, love seeing her everyday! I can not even get into the timeshare people, our favorite Silva was moved to the golf house, she now sells houses.  I did take a trip to visit her, and looked at a house that was AMAZING... They are building new units. Nothing on the lazy river.  We are going back in July, and I will find a way to go back again before years end.  Long story long Grand Solmar Rancho is our home away from home.  Can't wait to go back!!!",50,1187

"Wow what a nice experience we had in Una posada Mas. It's pretty, green, clean and comfy ! Martin and Irene the owners are very welcoming and answered all our questions. It's like literally 3 minutes walk to the Beach and all the best restaurants of Mazunte. I 100% recommend this place to anyone going there ! ",50,1188
"I tried out a few different places in Mazunte, and this one was by far the best.  It was the most conveniently located, very clean, eco-friendly and wonderful owners.  It is has everything you need. I especially recommend Una Posada Mas if you are traveling by yourself and looking for a place where you feel at ease and comfortable, but also not looking for a party hostal. It is a great price for what you get and you won't want to leave!",50,1188
"We stayed here over Easter which is a pretty hectic time in Mazunte with lots of Mexican tourists. We were not very organised in our planning but the owner Martin was exceptionally helpful and went to extraordinary lengths to accommodate us. He is a very friendly guy and responds very quickly to any emails. The room we stayed in was lovely, extremely clean. There is a nice courtyard as well where you can hang out and chat with other guests. Its in a great location as well, close to the beach and near a great bakery. The other staff member we met, I think here name was Goltic, was very obliging and efficient as well. I would strongly recommend Una Posada Mas to anyone, especially couples, staying in Mazunte.",50,1188
"Definetely one of the best posada options in Mazunte! A minute's walk from the Rinconcito beach and as closed as it gets to the Mermejita beach. Literally next to the best bars and restaurants which during Easter and New Years can be a bit noisy. The posada itself is beautifully designed with spacious rooms, all with open walls and en suite bathrooms. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!!",50,1188
Very charming place. Clean! Quiet and good privacy. Very nice and fair priced for the area. Excellent location...just down the road from the beach and restaurants. An English speaking worker and wifi were definite plus's for me. I would highly suggest staying here if traveling to Mazunte.,50,1188
"It's a nice little hotel/hostal. Rooms are basic but well accomodated with a fan and shower. No hot water needed, since it's really hot in Mazunte. Wifi worked. It's pet friendly, there are dogs and cats, which I love! There were plants and hammocks to relax in the terrace. Laura was always nice at us and helped us with anything we needed. The prices were really attractive despite it was high season. Loved this all eco-friendly place, I would strongly recommend it <3",50,1188
"From the first inquiry, Martín, the owner was prompt and helpful. The hostal is just off the side street that leads to the beach, about 3 minutes walk away. The hostal itself is very well maintained, with a nice communal area. The room we stayed in was excellent value with private bathroom separated from the bed area by a half wall (so make sure you have no intimacy issues if you're sharing the room!), simply but nicey decorated. Martín and Irene were very friendly and helpful with recommendations, calling a cab. I highly recommend this place,",50,1188
"We stayed here for 5 nights and it was pretty awesome! The posada is in a fantastic location right in the heart of Mazunte and next to a bakery that sells good sandwiches and other interesting stuff - natural yoghurt, free range eggs, granola and heaps more.   Martin, the owner, is lovely and made sure that we had everything we needed.   The rooms are clean and the beds are comfy. The only bad thing about this place is the noise from dogs and roosters in the early hours of the morning! Although all the houses in Mazunte are very open so this would probably be a problem anywhere in town. Would definitely come back!  ",40,1188
It was a lovely trip! We stayed only one night but I wish it was for a longer period! I'll surely come back in this bambou-style hotel. The location was perfect; we were only a little bit surprised by the price of the room when we saw it but it is still a good deal. Have fun!,50,1188
"Thanks to Una Posada Mas for a lovely and tranquil three-day visit to Mazunte. My room was clean and comfortable, with excellent beds and a hammock for my afternoon nap. It was really more of a covered, enclosed balcony than a proper room, which was great for soaking up the atmosphere and vibe of the town. Although the room is open to the outdoors, the beds are surrounded with mosquito netting in good condition to keep the nighttime critters away. Osvaldo (substituting for Martin who was away) is a friendly and helpful multilingual host. The common area of the inn is pleasant and cozy. The location is central, with plenty of places to eat, shop and relax just steps away, and Playa Rinconcito is no more than two minutes’ walk from the front door. I will be back!",40,1188

The absolute highlight of our visit was our personal concierge, Raymundo. He was exceptional in every way- assisted in dinner reservations, spa appointments, helping us know what time we needed to leave for restaurants and most special-he had our casita decked out & decorated to perfection as a birthday surprise. He made our trip so much more incredible-he is an angel! The pool staff is phenomenal as well-they work so hard. Yoshua is amazing. My only complaint is that when busy, all pool seats are taken by 8 am but frequently being held with a book or bottle of sunblock for hours. They",50,1189

"My husband and I visited Chileno Bay for vacation with our 1 year old. We stayed for a week and had a wonderful experience. Our daughter was doted on completely. We had her at all our meals and the servers and service was fast, accommodating, and very friendly. We requested a room on the ground floor by the pool to ensure walking distance wasn't far, we had a perfectly situated room close to all amenities allowing us to really maximize our time. Our concierge set everything up for us before we arrived, including a babysitter from Cabo babysitters who was wonderful. This allowed us a few hours a day by the pool to ourselves. The baby pool was perfect for our daughter, with crawl-safe water, and they were fully stocked with floaties for babies as well. All in all, this was a 10",50,1190

The vibe here is not only luxurious but also fun and generous.  We were traveling with our three year old and the attention to our needs was incredible. We have stayed in 5 star resorts and hotels all over the world and CB was probably our favorite overall experience.  From the stunning resort, top notch food, and genuinely warm staff, this place is a MUST and worth every penny.",50,1190

"Fortunate enough to be here with a work event. The property is beautifully located with beach views in on the Pacific Ocean. Although you can’t swim in the sea for safety reasons, it’s more than compensated by simple acts such as watching turtles arrive and lay their eggs.  The property standard is immaculate; a team of discreet and friendly safe constantly ensure the cleanliness of the resort.  Attention to detail is high and everything is considered to ensure we had a great time. We were allocated Alfredo Olguín, as our Local Ambassador to assist with whatever we needed. Alfredo was great securing whatever we needed in an easy and efficient manner.  Food was exceptional and we tasted lovely twists on everyday items, such as avocado pizza.  Resort is recommended and we hope you",50,1191

"We were here for 4 nights and i realized that's too short. I would like to start with this review by saying if you're looking for glamour, luxury, high maintenance, and royalty vibes this hotel is for highly recommended for you.  Yes it's expensive but you absolutely get what you're paying for. You will be treated as a King or Queen once you lay foot of the property. The property is outside the city of Cabo if THATS okay with you and you can't call a Uber to come pick you up from the hotel because of safety reasons (there's to checkpoints you need to come to the property, if you're not a guest I don't think you can come in. BUT you can ask your butler/room ambassador and they will call a cab for you to anywhere you want for $35 one price one way. And just call a Uber back to the",50,1191
" hotel it's much cheaper. and no swimming in the oceans because the currents are too strong and will swallow you up. But there's an infinity pool with a nice view of the ocean.   The welcome greeting was majestic we had a drink that tasted good and a hot towel and tour of the place. The scenery is sooo beautiful. From the pools to the layout to the eatery and much more. The rooms is jaw dropping gorgeous. And don't get me started on the showers and that big soft bed and the balcony.

"I stayed here in May 2022 and my main review is that the front desk/concierge/customer service at this resort was incredible. They were prepared to answer any question or help with any situation 24/7 and it was so appreciated. I particularly wanted to commend Jose, who seemed to be available throughout my stay and always welcomed each and every question I had and gave me a clear answer or offered to figure it out for me. The text communication was particularly handy. Would definitely stay here again!",50,1192
"The location of this property is fabulous -all within walking distance to the marina and shopping. Close to great spots like The Office or Sur Beach House. The design of the entrance way and lobby is very green and welcoming. Love the work lounge space along with the pool table and bar area. Thank you to Ivanna and Tabatha at the coffee juice grab and go a great spot to get a detox or immunity boost smoothie or latte. Also check out their merchandise like candles, totes, etc.  There are 2 pools the garden and oceanside infinity pool. Our favorite was the beachside. Aaron and Steve were making up some fabulous drinks. A must is the spinach, mango and mint smoothie - so refreshing and my favorite! Also loved the Cabo Pina colada a great mix of local rums and a hit while lounging",50,1192
" at the pool. We all loved the tacos, chicken fingers, mango salads and guacamole and chips at the poolside food truck- shout out to the chefs for an amazing lunch everyday! Mathias, Arcenio and Kevin were always at your service with great suggestions and amazing customer service. All wonderful personalities. Bruno at the pool area was also very welcoming each morning.  I'd also like to thank Christian, Javier and Andrea at the front desk for their attention to detail and guest services. Christian thank you for the full tour of the property and making our welcome a great start to the trip. Javier thank you for assistance in the check out process and meeting all of our needs. Lastly, Andrea the girls loved the surprise balloons for the birthday!  All the staff above really were instrumental in our wonderful family celebration.

"This resort is amazing!  The residence was perfect for a family get-away with the adult children.  It was beautiful and had a spectacular terrace with a pool and a large living and dining area.  The staff was so helpful and friendly starting with assistance prior to our arrival and through our entire stay.  Everywhere we went on the property we were greeted with a friendly hello.  Thank you Javier, Aaron, Jose, Cindy, Christian, Arsenio and Fernando for making us feel at home.   And thank you to Aaron for our Tequila and Mezcal Tasting and to Max for our Tamale cooking class.  We highly recommend both!  It was a fantastic vacation, and we wish we could have stayed longer.  We will definitely go again!",50,1192

"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at 1 Homes. The property is stunning and the staff is beyond attentive to any and all of your needs. The pool staff was always friendly and serving up the most delicious drinks. Absolutely everything on the food truck menu was delicious and fresh. We loved the BBQ day and special evening with sushi by the beach. Every server, bartender and concierge we came across went above and beyond for our family. Eduardo, Edson, arcenio, Diana, Aaron and many others, gracías for a trip we won’t forget.",50,1192
From start to finish the experience was amazing. The pampering starts right away with Jesus and Estela helping us throughout the spa and providing mimosas and a nice relaxing area. We got a couple's massage with Yaneli and Lucy and both my husband and I enjoyed the amount of pressure and the fact that they would stop to check on us. Then we got a chance to swim in the salt water pool and cool off. Definitely recommend!,50,1193
"We returned with a large party (multiple rooms) for spring break at Grand Solmar, and as always everything was wonderful.  Juan Carlos and his entire front desk staff did a wonderful job, both at check-in and during the week - including helping make it a magical birthday experience for our (adult) daughters. David spent a long time with us at check-in, working to arrange our rooms so that we were all close together - and then handle all the details of check-in, meal plans, etc.  We had a great poolside experience. Juan is an exceptional pool butler, and we met and were favorably impressed by Domingo, who has just joined Juan. Together they will make a terrific team. We also can't say enough about the excellent pool service from Adan.  La Roca is one of our favorite places to",50,1193

We also enjoyed eating at Brisas, where Jonathan went above and beyond (staying past the end of his shift to serve our party, even when several family members had to reschedule). Miguel always goes above and beyond to get the special foods that some in our party prefer - and to help us arrange for a magical birthday experience for our daughters.  We look forward to every return visit. The entire staff is consistently top-notch, and we appreciate being able to chat with them and get to know them as people. There is a personal connection that makes us feel valued - and on each visit we look forward to seeing our friends again and learning what is new in their lives.  For us there is no better place to stay - top-notch facility and outstanding people.",50,1193

The housekeeping staff always made sure the rooms were spotless. Thanks to Manny and the great bell staff for expertly handling our luggage and transportation needs.  Francisco Triano at the pool performed his magic keeping everyone's drinks fresh. He was awesome as usual! The Sunset Spa massage therapist, Karen, was wonderful with her relaxing techniques. The pool butters, Juan Quintanilla and Domingo, handled so many details for us that we could relax and enjoy family time at the pools. Gilberto Arellano and Freddie in the Sports Bar made sure we had all our favorite beverages.  Five Stars-Five Hearts-Five Diamonds - GSLE",50,1193

"Grand Solmar sets the standards high with its customer service. The resort itself is extremely clean, even down to the details of the sand being raked. Upon arrival you will be greeted by Manny and his team of bellmen.  These guys are great, and are great source of information about the resort as well as within Cabo.  Manny went beyond the call of duty for me last year and  helped me propose to my girlfriend. Even with everything he had going on, he took the time to ensure it all worked out as discussed. It worked perfectly.  This year we arrived and Manny remembered who I was, which was impressive with all the people that attend the resort. This year he helped me with a special arrangement for my fiancee.  Thanks Manny!  We spent a lot of time at the pool area and rented the",30,1193
" Cabana’s for several days.  We got to know Juan. He made an effort to stop by several times a day to ensure everything was going as well.  Any concerns he really wanted to address… and he would also make an effort to stop by with some chocolate drizzled pineapple. Yum! Juan really wanted to make sure that the experience at the pool was above par for us and it was.  Even though this resort is on the Pacific side of Cabo and gets some extra wind at times, the resorts service and its employees make you feel pampered and refreshed when you leave.  I would highly recommend this resort.  ",30,1193

Me and my fiancé came to the resort for a long weekend and had the best trip. Rogelio provided the best service and was very welcoming. I would 10/10 recommend the playa grande and look for Rogelio on The Ridge he will guarantee you have everything you need.,50,1194
Rogelio and Angel are my favorite bar tenders ever! The ridge has such amazing pools and views. I recommend the Ridge to anyone coming to Cabo. The location is perfect cause you can walk to the beach or to the city very easy.,50,1194
We went to the ridge and it is highly recommended and has great food and bartenders. The rooms are clean and all of the cleaning people are great! Rogelio was my waiter a few days and he was super friendly!,50,1194

I cannot say enough on the courtesy & just absolutely great service. Cheers  to The Ridge @ Playa Grande!,50,1194
"My wife and I traveled to The Ridge at Playa Grande with another couple for a week long vacation. The entire week, Jorge was always timely on checking on us for any need while we lounged by the pool. Sometimes I would just be looking around and we'd make eye contact and he would wave to make sure if I needed anything or not. He had fantastic drink recommendations and impeccable service, all complemented by a friendly demeanor. Highly recommend!!",50,1194
"Our time at Playa Grande, and more specifically the Ridge, was absolutely incredible. We stayed with another couple for a week in a penthouse. Views of the marina and ocean made for a memorable time. Best of all, the service at the pool was incredible. We opted into the all inclusive plan and were well taken care of by Jorge. He was incredibly attentive, friendly, and really made the experience five stars. We can’t wait to come back!",50,1194
"Great service, awesome staff….Rogelio and Cirilo provide great friendly service every day. Awesome views, great food, drinks and views. Definitely coming back. Close to downtown, the beach, and other activities.",50,1194
We had an amazing time at Playa Grande Resort. At the Ridge pool side our favorite bartender was Raciel. So nice and he always remembered what we were drinking and knew our room number! Very happy guy and was patient with us when we tried to provide our order in Spanish.,50,1194

"This was our fifth stay, and this place is consistently amazing. It’s quiet, which we love, yet close to the party scene, which our twenty-something kids appreciate. It’s not an all-inclusive, though I think there are some all-inclusive meal plans you can get. The views from these villas are to die for, the service you get is outstanding, and you are clearly valued as a guest by everyone on the staff. We’ve definitely found our happy place and we’ll be back!",50,1195
Axel was amazing. He was the best! Had drinks delivered quickly. Very courteous and nice. Best service I have ever received. He brought our food and drinks just as we asked. Gracias Axel! We will definitely come here again,50,1195
Positive: - very nice garden and pool area - nice rooms with comfortable beds - one of the few beaches in the area where you can actually go into the ocean - close to Cabo San Lucas  Negative: - shared balconies for most rooms - 'Kids eat free' promotion has so many restrictions that it's almost more of an annoyance than benefit - Hotel charged 7 passengers a total of $154 for a shared taxi to the airport that did not have air conditioning so everyone arrived sweaty prior to their trip back home,30,1195
Villa Estancia was an incredible resort. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the suites were amazing. My bf and I traveled to Cabo for a week- we stayed in the One bdrm ocean view suite- well worth the upgrade to ocean view. We also opted for the all inclusive package- although it didn’t include alcohol the food was great. There is an endless amount of restaurants to choose from (across all three resorts) ranging from walk up and order to pool side service and more formal fancy sit downs. The restaurants I would definitely hit are: Neptunes seafood with a view) La Casona (steakhouse) Shrimp tacos by the pool were amazing (la Parilla poolside grill) and tacos at the Villa del Arco hotel were also great. There are some “premium” items on the menus not included for the,50,1195
" all inclusive package but it wasn’t really a bother as there were many many options that were included! Additionally for the restaurants that did require reservations, they were easy to come by and often we called same day and they were able to accommodate. Highly recommend a trip to the spa at Villa del Arco next door- the facilities and services are amazing. We will definitely be coming back! The only minor complaint is that we did not know we’d be sharing our (expansive) patio with a studio room next door. If you have a large group this space would be ideal as the one bedrooms attached to a studio room and would make for plenty of space for multiple couples or larger families!",50,1195

"Alberto is the best! He remembered everything about us by the third day, highly recommend. The food at Villa la Estancia is very good especially La Parilla and La Casona! The drinks arent very strong though so be warned that you will be asking for doubles just ti get a buzz",50,1195
"Loved our stay at the Villa La Estancia! The staff were super friendly and helpful during our visit. The on-site restaurant, La Casona, was incredible too! The staff there treated us like royalty, literally. Angela, Adrian, Luz, and Fredy really went above and beyond to make us feel special. Oliver at the front desk and Angel were also especially helpful in making sure we enjoyed our stay. The entire resort was squeaky clean and we didn’t even see any bugs! The entire staff was friendly and attentive. And the pool area was huge so we never felt cramped or crowded and had access the towels whenever needed. Will definitely look forward to another visit there. I really have no complaints. Other than when we first arrived, we were a bit overwhelmed and confused because our group was",50,1195

"My wife and I stayed at Hacienda Beach Club this past week, and it was exceptional.  A few things: -From the time we arrived to the time we left, the experience was delightful. -The staff was professional, service minded, and attentive. -Our room was wonderful...clean, nice, and huge compared to a typical hotel room since these are homes that are owned by private individuals. -The ambiance was classy (not a party crowd). -The amenities were great, including the gym, the cafe, the spa, the infinity pools and lounge areas, restaurant, and beach.  On the beach, you have access (Jorge, you were amazing) to kayaks, paddle boards, tubes, and related free of charge.   -Location: It's right in the middle of the action in Cabo, so you have access to great dining around, are right on the",50,1196
" beach, and we kayaked to the arch in 15 minutes. -The food onsite was great; it's a little pricey, but it's quality and make it easy just to eat onsite.  The only downside was that the during the afternoon, the party music off the ocean can get a little annoying (all the party boats), but there's nothing the hotel could have done to prevent...it's part of being in a great location.  Thanks to all the staff (Victor, Mauricio, Miguel, and so many I'm not calling out) that were across the bar great.  We'll be coming back!",50,1196

Manuel and Victor with the concierge were so helpful, we were able to get everything we needed with just a text! The beach is so clean and fun to swim in and the pool is beautiful. We basically had the place to ourself so it was quiet and relaxing. I got a massage at the spa and it was incredible. If you’re debating about booking here do it! We couldn’t have been happier with our stay.",50,1196

"This is an all-around incredible hotel. It takes a village for every aspect of a stay to be 10/10 and the Hacienda does it. Its location is the best if you want amazing restaurants in walking distance, the best beach in Cabo, and privacy while being near everything you could possibly want. The actual rooms are wonderful too. They are tastefully decorated in traditional Mexican décor, cleaned to perfection upon arrival and with the daily service, and you can even drink the water from the faucet. The service here is top-notch which for me is the most important part. From the moment we entered the gates and they said ""welcome home"" we experienced five star service. The staff does not make you feel like an inconvenience at all, each and every person we encountered at the Hacienda",50,1196

"What an absolutely beautiful setting for a girls trip!  There were six of us staying in one of the villas, Roberto was our concierge.  He was SO accomodating!  Answered the phone on the first ring and had a van waiting to take us to the golf course or downtown.  He arranged two private chef dinners that were amazing!  We enjoyed our private pool and hot tub with a view of the ocean but also the bar pool! All food was fantastic.  We enjoyed cocktails at Cocina del Mar and took in the waves crashing against the rocks - mezmerizing!!  But do not miss the restaurant in the middle of the resort, Las Estrellas!  No ocean view but we enjoyed the fire pit after dinner - great ambience and there was a small acoustic band playing on Thursday night.  The best bruschetta I have ever tasted",50,1197
" and the pizza was so delicious!!  The beds were comfortable, but be warned - no top sheet!  Each bed had a duvet cover but no top sheet.

It was beautiful, to start with...from the rooms, to the landscape, to the beautiful hotel itself, perched on the edges of the natural cliff like it belonged there. We were there in May, which is the windy month for Cabo, and we had some 14 mile an hour winds for a portion of our trip, along with the full moon, this caused enormous waves to beat upon the rocks in the ocean, creating a powerful and beautiful display - especially with the cliff lights from the restaurant shining on them at night. Breathtaking. We loved our meals - from breakfast to an elegant dinner at the main restaurant, and then our favorite place for lunch (and 2 dinners) the",50,1197

Our waiter, Marcos, was so welcoming, charming and great for service and a smile. I have gluten and dairy allergies, and found everyone in the resort very good at helping me get what I needed without feeling like I was being difficult...lovely staff.

"We stay at the Residences several times a year.  We've always had an amazing time.  One of the highlights of staying in the Residences is having access to a butler.  The last few times Guillermo has been our butler.  He's friendly, attentive and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy and have everything we need to enjoy our vacation.    We'll be down again in a few weeks with our adult kids and will make sure to request Guillermo again!",50,1200
"You know a trip has been very special when you come home and day dream about it. We had an amazing week at Vista and The Residences. So much packed into a short 10 days…with early morning sunrises, Easter at the chapel, workouts at the Vista gym, coffees and espressos before breakfast at Marias - with our Claudia always knowing our order- lazy days at the pools, pickleball in the afternoons, lovely sunset dinners, karaoke nite, evening dinner shows and music, the list goes on and on. But far and away the best part of the memories are the new friends we make while there, meeting up with old friends who love it as much as we do and visiting and catching up with our Mexican Familia who work at the resort - our butlers Monserrat, Guillermo and Omar, Trinidad, the Bell Captain, Paul,",50,1200

Villa was clean and housekeeping was top notch.",50,1200

But it gets even better!! You have your own Butler!!! Our Fabulous Butler was, CLIMENTE!! A delightful, bright, articulate, professional, good looking, nice young man who served our every need! We could not have asked for more! Making reservations, bringing something we may need, making recommendations, solving issues, changing reservations, answering questions, arranging Covid tests, rescheduling events!!  Climente was on top of everything!! I would text him numerous times a day! He would always respond quickly with an “I’m on it Ma’am” We absolutely love Climente!! It’s going to be hard to go",50,1200

The rooms are simple but very functional and the small details you find from the roomservice are done with love. There is a nice small pool with sunbeds and hammocks  right in the center of this small hotel and a self-service bar/restaurant with an outdoor kitchen where they also serve breakfast. The Cerrito Beach is only a 2 Min walk from the hotel which is offering beachtowels, beachchairs and sunshades for all guests to take away to the beach. The hotel is also offering free parking in its premises. Big value for a small price!",50,1201
"Olas de Cerritos is a gem of a find, located in the heartbeat of Los Cerritos. Part of what I love about this area of Baja is the raw elegance. The beaches are wonderful, the people are friendly, and the costs are very reasonable. The rooms are  basic and that was my expectation - we were only in the room to sleep. The breakfasts were DELICIOUS, they provided beach accessories (chairs, towels, umbrellas, surf/boogie boards, etc.), the room prices are reasonable, and the vibe is relaxed. I spent time working on my laptop outside under the palapa. You are in walking distance to everything in Cerritos. I definitely recommend a stay at Olas de Cerritos.",50,1201

The rooms are basic, the breakfast is delicious, and the location to the beach is priceless.  Plus, you have Barracuda (tacos) right next door!  You cannot get any better. Our weather wasn't as hot as we would have liked, but we requested the hot tub on the coldest day and it was perfect!",50,1201
"This was an absolute delight. I have been to Cerritos 3 different times and this was by far my favorite place to stay yet. I was solo, so the size and price fit me perfectly, but it would be great for families or couples as well. The breakfasts are terrific, the beach chairs and umbrellas, bicycles, hammocks, boogie boards, etc all for you to use at the beach just about 400 yards away. The pool and pool are is lovely, the parking is secure and right next to the building. the location in relation to the beach was fantastic.",50,1201

Besides the kitchen lady, we didn’t see anyone of the hotel during our whole stay. There wasn’t anyone to welcome us our check us in upon arrival. No explanation of the area, facilities or anything. We had to call them and they said the key was on our room door. Also upon check-out we didn’t see anyone. We just left the key there and apparently they just booked the money from our creditcard. It was very inhospitable and impersonal. ",30,1201

A block from the beach, next door to tacos, you literally cannot get any better!  We found this hotel tranquil.  We were a little worried about safety reading that long review from Christmas, but we found no issues.  We never felt our room or belongings at risk. The pool was a perfect treat after a day walking around in Todos Santos! Breakfast was delicious and coffee always ready when I woke up.  Olas de Cerritos we will be back!  It was such a quick trip, we wish we could have stayed longer!  Now a little about the area.  Remember when visiting Pescadero, you will need a car.

We are frequent visitors to Cerritos and this was the first time staying at the Surf Residences. The condos are very new and have wonderful views of the ocean. We rented one of the penthouses and so enjoyed the huge roof patio with fire pit and the outside kitchen. The unit was stocked so well with anything you might need for cooking and entertaining and had beach chairs and umbrellas. The beds were super comfy and had nice linens. The concierge was incredibly responsive and met us upon check in. Having a restaurant and bar onsite is such a bonus and we enjoyed a fantastic breakfast on our last day. This is walkable to the beach and several restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!,50,1202
"Todos santos is an amazing mostly undiscovered escape. It is safe and beautiful.  The Surf Side Residencies are really nice. We walked around with the door to our room  left open and had zero worries. The pools are beautiful and kept very warm and clean. The bar is fun and all the staff are beyond friendly.  The concierge went above and beyond. We had great champagne, house tequila and more all given complimentary.  The studio 56 suite is a resort of its own.   I promise you will not be disappointed.",50,1202
"We rented Casa Loba for two nights at the end of our trip to Baja. It exceeded all our expectations and was without a doubt the nicest place we stayed at while visiting Baja. It was just stunning. Cerritos was the perfect and much needed alternative to resorts that saturate the landscape in a nameless town further south down the coast. Those hold zero appeal and way too many people for our taste. While we stayed at Casa Loba I don't think you can go wrong here as the layout of the units are the same and the modern esthetics seems to run trough out them. We will be back, no question. The condo was beautiful, full kitchen, spacious rooms, washer and dryer and the outdoor grilling patio over looked the pool and the grounds which were well maintained, pristine and peaceful.

Martin the Manager was fantastic and super responsive to emails and inquiries. We communicated via WhatsApp a bit during our stay and he helped us out with our necessary Covid Testing prior to returning the USA and called, made a same day appointment and someone from St. Jude's came and administered the test to us in the condo and we had our results emailed to us in 2 hours.

"It was our first time to this area of Mexico, and we can't wait to return. Cerritos itself is a relaxed charmer with an awesome beach for kids. Todos Santos is only 20 minutes away, so we went up there everyday for some great coffee and food. The Cerritos Surf Residences were fantastic - the facility and staff are both top notch. We ate on site at least one meal per day, sometimes at the pool, sometimes in our room. Awesome food at a good price and great drinks. They have hotel quality amenities, but with a 2br condo that is really nice and new. As some have mentioned, there is a lot of construction in the area - not just  next door to The Cerritos Surf residence, but all over town.

But note: this property is building phase 2 next door and there are quite a few other construction projects going on around this property. So there is a lot of noise and dirt flying around.  It's unfortunate as my husband and I upgraded and spent more money to stay in the PENTHOUSE VENI, VIDI, AMAVI suite but we couldn't even sit outside or enjoy the roof top deck. We had to keep the sliding glass doors closed the whole time due to the noise and dirt. The dirt/dust was all over the chairs, tables and balcony floors.

I believe it was one of those mattresses in a box.

This is a lovely hotel, tiny and uber-functional, a mix of industrial and organic…but with caveats.   First, steps. You’ll be encountering a lot of them in Todos Santos, and Casa Morelos is no exception. I walked up from the bus terminal (about two blocks) and that meant navigating steep steps. I cheated and rolled my bag along in the street, but that didn’t get me around the interior steps. I’d bought Olivia pottery in La Paz and my suitcase was heavy as a result. I hauled it up to the third (top) floor along the twig/rebar rails.   Second, my room was teensy. This is not",40,1203

The private balcony is a wonderful spot to watch the sun set or enjoy a morning coffee brought back from one of Todos Santos’ upscale coffee shops.   Third, noise. Casa Morelos is at the center of a small town with a heavy tourist presence, so the upside is a convenient location. The downside is the serenade of nearby restaurants and bars. Earplugs come with the room, and so does a rooster organic alarm clock.   Other notes: The wifi mostly worked, but sometimes had slowdowns. Maybe it’s a traffic thing. I wasn’t working so it wasn’t a problem, and anyway, my cell signal was strong here perched over town. Shower water heated up quickly on demand, and the ceiling fan was a nice touch. The balcony has a patio umbrella, a candle, two chairs, and a little table. The bed came with sheets and a thin alpaca blanket, but a larger blanket was stored on a shelf in front of the bed. A carafe of filtered water and continental breakfast was included, but the breakfast setup looked…continental, so I skipped it and went to Taller17 instead. The swimming pool is small but there is access to a larger hotel pool (I didn’t take notes on which hotel, being there only overnight).   Casa Morelos is lovely and I would stay again.",10,1203

I am not one to write bad reviews, this is my first, but when management is completely unresponsive you have no other recourse.  On a positive note the design of the hotel is lovely, and it is filled with interesting outwork.  The first room we were put in was dark in tiny (we had to hop over our suitcase to get to the bathroom), and the receptionist was helpful in getting us into a different room. But everything else...the internet did not work, and so whenever we wanted to use it we had to go to a cafe or restaurant (where we never encountered any issues).  Water pressure was great in the shower but there was rarely hot water.  There was a club next door that blasted music till about midnight, (not the",30,1203

The breakfast was pretty awful, which was hard to understand in a town so filled with amazing food.  You are only provided with one small refillable bottle of drinking water.  You can ask staff to refill it and they will, when they are there, but the kitchen is locked at night, so if you want water past 7 you did to go to the store.  The biggest issue we had however was that the hotel was absolutely freezing at night.  It got down into the low 50s, and in our room the large window did not completely shut. We were only provided one thin blanket.  When I requested additional bedding staff stated that they did not have any, but would see what they could do.  I asked again the following day and was told that there were no additional blankets and there was nothing they could do.  I slept at night with sweats over my pajamas and m husbands dirty socks on my feet.  After four days of cold showers, no sleep due to the cold and noise, and no internet we decided to leave.  Staff was indifferent to our complaints, and again, I get that they have no control over the noise, but to not supply your guests with blankets was just beyond.  We asked to cancel the remainder of our reservation and they stated they were unable to do so due to us having booked though booking.com.  This turned out to be untrue-booking agreed to refund their portion but first needed the hotel to agree.  They refused, even at booking.com's request, and so we paid over $600 for our remaining four nights.  I am still happy we left however, as we had a wonderful experience at the Todos Santos Inn, and the extra money was worth it to have working internet, hot water, a delicious breakfast, helpful staff, and most importantly a warm room with blankets.",50,1203

"We have never been one to like all inclusive resorts.   We previously stayed at Auberge's Esperanza at Cabo and ventured out to restaurants since my wife and I are extremely picky about food.  Since we haven't been away for over 2 years because of COVID  and we just wanted to relax and not think about going out for meals we decided to take a chance.    Grand Velas was amazing.    The service was top notch.  The breakfast and lunch buffets were terrific.  They had jamon iberico at a lunch buffet which was a first.  You can also ask for whole fried local snapper for lunch which was amazing.   Pro tip: You can take your buffet food on a plastic plate and eat our breakfast and lunch pool side.     You can basically order any food you want poolside as well (Fresh fruit, tacos,",50,1204

When I was interested in seeing how the Chocolate Clam ceviche was made Alex at the Ceviche bar saved live clams for me so he could show me how they were shucked from start to finish.  Lastly, all of their citrus juices were fresh squeezed  (juice from concentrate is a pet peeve of ours)   At the end of the trip, we were so full of food that frankly it was hard to even eat the last dinner.   You can ask for anything you want for room service as well.   Everything is included so the only thing on our bill was gratuity that we left at each meal.    Our concierge for the six days was Mariana who responded by WhatsApp at all times of the day.  All the restaurants were terrific and we were very satisfied.  Since we are wine collectors we brought a case of burgundy for the trip and had them with meals and by the pool; which ultimately led to a friendship with an professional hockey player who was also a burgundy lover.

I had a certain amount of concern having not stayed in many all-inclusive places, and certainly not in one as big as Grand Velas, but we all thought that the accommodation, facilities, and setting were first rate. More particularly, the food offered in the different restaurants was excellent and plentiful. Each of the chefs at the restaurants went out of their way to create special meals for us and ensure that they had what we wanted to eat, given the length of our stay. More than anything, the staff at Grand Velas were what makes the place all super friendly, and aiming to please.

The resort itself is stunning, the lobby looks like an art museum and really sets the stage for the kind of luxury you are about to experience. All of the food and drinks were amazing, and of course, the location can’t be any better. Honestly, everything we ate and drank here was 5+ star, as well as the service…everyone that we encountered was incredibly attentive, welcoming, and genuinely wanted us to have the best time. Whenever we would walk by a staff member, even if they were busy doing something else, they would stop, smile and offer a friendly greeting like Buenos Dias or something",50,1204
" similar. It was nice to be greeted with so much kindness throughout our stay.  After we checked in, we were given a personal concierge, Victor Villaseñor, who was the nicest, most thoughtful and engaging man…we enjoyed getting to know him and truly loved all the recommendations and information he had for us.  He checked in on us throughout the day, each day we were there and would sometimes find us at the pool just to say hi and see if we needed anything (dinner plans, spa, resort activities, etc). He was a professional and fun addition to our trip, and we’ve gained a friend on What’s App!! Speaking of the pool, they have 3 gorgeous infinity pools, the adult only pool is where we spent the majority of our time. But there are water aerobics classes (Eunice was the cutest instructor, always smiling and having a great time teaching in the pool), volleyball nets, big swan and unicorn floats, ping pong tables, hammocks and more at the other pools.  All the pool servers, esp Gonzalo and Ruben, were so kind, so attentive, and were always there to get whatever you wanted. And Hugo, is by far, the ultimate pool concierge…he brought such a positive and fun vibe to the pool area. We all loved when he would swim around with a float full of cocktails, and fresh made popsicles with a tequila or vodka shot to dip the delicious popsicles in. It was such a fun atmosphere to be in and he really made it entertaining and memorable. I almost forgot to mention the beautiful gym..lots of modern equipment and a million dollar balcony view.  We have never been to an all inclusive before, but many of the people we talked to on this trip said that the Grand Velas is like no other all-inclusive place they have been, and they have set a new standard. The variety of places to eat, the range of talent in the kitchen and bar, the daily activities, the fantastic people who work here, and the overall vibe of this resort feels luxurious, ultra pampering, and very well organized.

We originally saw it on Airbnb, but it’s more like a hotel where staff is there from 10-6 and you have daily housekeeping if needed. I have really conflicting feelings about this place, because the location and accommodations were better than anything we could have dreamed of. But the property manager, Anabel, was a nightmare. I can't confidently recommend this place to others because she was so rude and difficult to work with. Prior to arriving, I saw other parties leave bad reviews about Anabel as well - the owner should really take these multiple negative reviews about her more seriously before it ruins their business.

We regretted not having dinner with this kitchen staff but we wanted to try outside areas and the property manager took way too long to give us any details about the menu and pricing (1 month prior to arrival, about 5 months after asked). They use microdyn for the produce and no one ever got sick. - They were able to set up a doctor to come to the property to do the Covid tests for return flight requirements - Short beautiful walk to a beach where we saw whales breaching.  - Most of the staff were incredibly kind and helpful. The staff always wore masks which was relieving to me as I work in healthcare and am still being cautious with Covid (the only person who never wore a mask was Anabel - go figure) - Nayeli was on it with checking people in, showing us the grounds, getting us beach umbrellas, blankets, etc. She showed us true hospitality. That girl should be running the place instead. This would solve all of their problems.  - Loved the filtered water and reusable bottles. It was very eco friendly.   The Bad:  - Our check in was at 3 pm and some rooms weren’t ready until 5:30 so after a long day of traveling, half of our guests had to wait for hours to shower and put away luggage.  - Anabel is the main point of contact prior to arrival. She was rude, accusatory, and threatening. She contradicted herself multiple times and threatened to cancel our reservation less than 24 hours before we arrived. This was so nerve-wracking since it was an international trip for 26 people. She left a bad taste in my mouth before we even got there. When she was around, she was cold towards all of us and never wore a mask. It was very uncomfortable. She was there when we checked out to collect tips for her staff, but we decided to tip the kitchen and staff directly instead as she wasn’t trustworthy.  - Long story: Anabel kept accusing us of throwing an event and trying to hide it from her. We had to send screenshots to her and her coworkers of our previous conversations that showed her contradicting herself to get her to stop harassing us. She originally told us in writing it would be okay if 1 couple said their vows on the property and had a sit down dinner (they previously got married during Covid). She later said it wasn’t okay (after we already paid the deposit) and would cost an extra $15k if we had any sort of event. This was manageable because we had no intentions of having an event and were under capacity at all times; we told her we would do the vows on the beach instead and just do dinner.  She never responded to us about the dinner quote or menu, so we decided to get an outside caterer and have dinner on the beach as well - It sounded like a good backup option and where else in the world do you get to do that?!  We used a caterer that used to work for her, because she was highly recommended. Anabel was very upset we weren’t using her kitchen staff (probably because she couldn’t make more money off of us) and this is when she started threatening to cancel us. During our dinner on the beach (off their property), she called the cops on the caterers for not having a permit but it just felt like a way to retaliate.  The staff repeatedly told us that we were their favorite group that has stayed with them and they couldn’t wait for us to come back. Anabel however made us feel unwelcome every time we spoke.",10,1207

The manager Anabel is very impolite and liar.  I organise a yoga retreat in Pachamama and she sent me the menu only 5 days before and everything was wrong. She didn’t change the meals and she attacked me. I tried to contact the owner. He saw my message and he didn’t answer… The place is too expensive compared to the quality of the food and the service. They didn’t change towels as they promised.  I don’t recommend this place.   Several people had stomacale infection,50,1207
"This place is beautiful and relaxing, but since we went on our own and not with a yoga retreat of any sorts, there was not dining offered aside from breakfast. The road to the property is quite bumpy and it’s 20 mins from the main town, and thankfully we had a rental car to go out to get food. The teepee is cute but we had a hard time sleeping both nights for some reason. Pool is amazing and enjoyed the peacefulness of the property. The staff was kind overall too.",50,1207
"In January 20 20 I hosted my third yoga, meditation and transformational retreat at Pachamama. I don’t have enough time or words to tell you all the great things about this property. From its picturesque location, too it’s amazing luxurious property itself, to the kind and thoughtful staff who anticipate your every need, to the delicious local food, to the gorgeous setting, to the administrative and management staff who work with you at every need to Accommodate your every wish, this property is a dream come true. I have two retreats booked to bring students in November 2020 and April 2021 and I already know how pleased we will all be to be there.

This is the 3rd time I have come to this property and every time it gets better and better.  It's cozy a quiet. Set close enough but far enough from the cute town of Todos Santos. There's a ton of privacy throughout the property with plenty of places to chill and hang out. There's also a ton of variety offered from the hotel. Some days we wanted to hang and get spa services and others we wanted to go out on adventures. The best part was that they took care of it all from start to finish.  THE FOOD! And I can't stress this enough is on point. We have some dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate every single ask. They were also extremely happy to do. My only wish is that I had a bigger stomach to keep eating it was so good! ;)  Their team is small but super,50,1207
" communicative. The responded to all emails in no time.   I have brought groups here yearly, 25-30 people at a time and everyone keeps coming back. I can't recommend this place enough.",50,1207
"So great clean hotel, friendly staff, but dirt bikers!!!   How many times can people yell “”cannon ball!!!” And jump into the pool?   Bikers bringing in 6 packs (cans) to drink by the pool (solo)?   Loud obnoxious guests.  The hotel needs to chose their guests.",10,1208
"We stopped to have drinks at the bar, sat outside and enjoyed ourselves. We ordered the chicken nachos and they were delicious. So relaxing and very clean. There was an amazing pool in the center of the hotel. We would love to go back and actually stay at the hotel.",50,1208
"The hotel is clean and located in the center of town. But the rooms are very basic. Except for the mattress, there are no other real furniture in the room. Everything is made out of concrete including the bed frame, nightstand, table, sink etc. The room is very small. The only windows are facing the pool and it gets super loud. Not a place you should stay for long and it's certainly not relaxing.  Luckily we were only here for 1 night. Todos Santos is really a place to just drive by for a quick stop. I would recommend moving onto the coast area for the beautiful beaches and much better amenities.  ",20,1208
We stayed one night.  Very reasonable price and it was much better than expected. The pool area is small but updated and really nice.  We could definitely hang out there if we were staying longer.  The staff were very helpful.  There is an attached bar that you can order drinks from.  We had breakfast there the next morning which was good.  The room was comfortable and a good size.  Multiple rooftop sitting areas.  You can easily walk to art galleries and restaurants.  We would definitely recommend.  It’s a 15 room hotel- with a great rooftop space.- this would be a great venue for a large family gathering or wedding.,50,1208
"We stayed here for a couples get away and to explore Todos Santos for the first time.  The hotel was cute, clean and charming.  The rooms are simple but yet still provide you with what you need (except a hair dryer - bring your own).  The staff were very welcoming.  The pool is centrally located in the middle of the hotel but it was very quiet.  There are roof top patios available for lounging.  The hotel has a restaurant and bar (actually two bars) attached.  Hotel Casa Tota is located in the city center.  It was perfect for walking around the city to shop, check out historic landmarks or dine out.  They had plenty of off street parking.  WiFi is available in the restaurant and hotel rooms but I found that in the room it wasn’t as reliable.  We’ll definitely return if we are in",50,1208

"We didn’t stay at the Hotel Casa Tota, but it had a lovely clean aesthetic- and beautifully set around a marvelous pool. Next time we will! But my husband and I stumbled upon the restaurant and bar last night and had great drinks and dinner there. Tommy, the bartender/server, was awesome. Friendly, efficient, and all-around great guy! Highly recommend it!",50,1208
"Casa Tota is a small boutique hotel.  It is quiet, beautiful, clean, modern and no frills.  If you are looking for a quiet oasis, this is for you.  If you are looking for something bigger and lively then this might not be the place you want.  The pool is lovely and they also have a roof top patio area that has a great view and is very relaxing.  It is conveniently located in the historic downtown and you can walk to everything very easily.  The historic downtown is small, quiet and charming.  It is very peaceful and safe.  The restaurant is also very good.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  My salad was so fresh, I was like ""did you just pick the lettuce?""  Even the fruit that came with our meals was fresh and yummy.  They also had some of the best pancakes I have ever had. ",50,1208
" So even if you aren't staying at the hotel, it's a great option to eat.  Next door is a cute bar called Alchemia which has live music on Friday night.  Don't worry, they are quiet after 10pm so it should not disturb your sleep :) .",40,1208
"We stumbled upon this gem of a hotel when we went for a quick overnight 'vacation within a vacation' to Todos Santos during our recent trip to Mexico. First let me say that there are only eight--as in 8--as in ocho--total rooms in the entire hotel, which means even when the hotel is ""packed,"" you still feel like you have the place to yourself. The pool is big enough for our whole family to enjoy, there's a hot tub right by the bar, the food is great, and the rates were relatively inexpensive. Plus both of my kids had their own bed (the couch is really a very cozy bed, and it has a separate pullout mattress area beneath it, which means you could sleep up to six people in the room if you put two people in each double bed and one on both of the sofa mattresses).   Yes it's a tad",50,1209
" off the beaten path (0.4 miles outside the city center), but you could easily walk or drive into town. And the staff... how have I not mentioned the staff until now?? Everyone there is fabulous, bending over backward to ensure our stay was enjoyable. Manuel is the bartender / server / house guy, and was incredibly polite. One of the cooks had her son assisting her and he helped bring out the food. It felt like a family operation in the best possible sense, and we were part of the family.   I'll also add that while we are a family of four with young-ish kids, there were three single guys from France staying there the same time we were, and a group of motorbike riders checked in the next morning, so this hotel definitely caters to all types. The rooms were all very well appointed and I loved the fun, pseudo-trendy style. No in-room kitchen, but there was a mini fridge.   You will not be disappointed. I can not recommend this place more!",50,1209

"We stayed at the Quinta Santa Rosa with 30 friends to celebrate our wedding, and the hotel exceeded our expectations in every way. The property is beautiful and PERFECT for a group event. Ahmed, the manager, went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. He coordinated COVID tests for everyone on the last day of our stay - we were able to take them poolside. The bartenders, Edwin and Miguel, were amazing! Our whole group was raving about the service. We truly felt like friends by the end of the week. Fatima and the rest of the cleaning staff were so friendly and even did laundry for us. The food was INCREDIBLE - it was like we had private chefs for our stay.

The food is amazing, the rooms super spacious and neat. The bathroom was impecable and super nice. The pool was cold though but those days were cloudy with almost no sun. The jacuzzi/hot tub was amazing and super relaxing. I would definitely stay again if I return to Todos Santos",50,1209
"Stay here if you want to be physically attached on property by a patron who has been grossly over served alcohol at the hotel bar and has become violent and psychotic.   Stay here if you don’t mind that the hotel does not provide reliable security or night watch, and you would like to hear said intoxicated patron screaming, swearing, beating and kicking objects, doors, etc throughout the entire night around the hotel.. *and would like to wake up to your car (and other vehicles) having been heavily vandalized aka beaten in with a rock.   NO staff were available on property to even *attempt to attend to this situation for many many hours.   My car received upwards of $2,000 usd in damages.

Great open air kitchen with dedicated space for each room.  Good proximity to the beach. Great work space. Best of all, Mao and Jime were lovely, gracious hosts - helping us out of a jam with a rental car and making us feel at home. Highly recommended.",50,1210
"The layout and amenities are super cool...great place to lounge, cook in the communal kitchen or get work done over the reliable WIFI.   Also,  a really good spot to meet other travelers and surfers.  Much more fun than your standard/boring hotel.",50,1210
"I came to todos santos to recharge and the Perro Surfero was the perfect place for a home base. Mao and Vivian were such lovely, gracious hosts and the hotel was a wonderful oasis. My room was awesome and the different spaces you can use throughout the property are also wonderful, from the roof terraces, to the fire pit, the the gym and my personal favorite, the hammock over the pool.. All so thoughtfully curated. I hope to return soon!",50,1210
"Mao and Vivian are golden, such great people. My room was a great size.  Comfy beds and pillows.  The room and all public spaces are very clean and well maintained. People were social and a lot of common spaces but never loud hanging out at night. A good mix of people passing through and long term stays. It’s so great people were always trying to extend the time, including myself. Coffee every morning. Mao and Vivian are always thinking of making this better than they already are ...they organize breath work  and an ice bath event, so much fun. Anything you need they are so on it and helpful.

Lots of space to socialise with other guests but also to have more private dinners. Mau and his staff are great. Would highly recommend!",50,1210
"We stayed here twice, the hotel was clean and so inviting. Mao and Elizabeth were really helpful, even set up a horseback riding excursion. Would definitely recommend! The kitchen it great, they have water, beach chairs, coolers, umbrella all to use for no extra charge, as well as the fire pit.",50,1210

The day we checked in happened to be my husbands birthday and Mao even left us a nice bottle of wine waiting in our room as an arrival gift and made us dinner reservations at this amazing spot to celebrate <3 The property itself is very well thought out ( communal kitchen and comfy seating areas all over were huge highlights) and the room was so comfortable and beautifully minimalistic with super cool features like a rain shower head.

"I wanted to book a stay in a small, cozy hotel in a small, cozy beach town for a solo vacation between leaving an old job and starting a new position, and this place couldn't have been more perfect for me. I stayed for 5 nights and left feeling rejuvenated and well cared for.   I stayed in the twin beds room, which was adorable and well-suited to my space needs. In the mornings, you're treated to a delicious homemade breakfast in the courtyard and unlimited coffee, and from there you can either head out for an adventure or hang out all day in the sun by the pool; I sampled both options.   The staff is incredibly kind and friendly, the shower/bath products are great (a v. important Hotel Element, in my opinion), the in-room robes are beautiful and there are tons of restaurants,",50,1211
" shops and bars 5 minute walks away. Getting to the beach is a bit more of a hike; it took me 40 minutes, but I turned it into a Real hike up on the cliffs, which was gorgeous and super fun.   One thing: I checked out reviews before I flew over, and I have to tell you, people are not exaggerating about the barking dogs nearby. They do NOT let up all night, there's a ton of them and they are loud!   To prepare, I brought ear plugs with me (if you have a small head/ears like I do get child sized earplugs. trust me) and it ended up being a complete non-issue. Some nights I didn't need the earplugs at all bc I was so tired from being out all day and just slept through the barking; other nights the earplugs were necessary, but with them in I fell asleep just fine.   Overall, this is a beautiful place to stay -- flowers everywhere, attentive staff and an incredibly good, chill vibe. I would love to come back, and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!",40,1211

"What a wonderful hotel. If you're like me and avoid sterile hotel chains, you'll love this place. The rooms are cheerfully and comfortably decorated to reflect the local culture (great tiled walk-in shower), the breakfasts are delicious and enough food to last most active people until late afternoon. La Bohemia is a tranquil place within walking distance to the local shops sand restaurants. It's well worth a slow stroll around the grounds to catch the thoughtful design, decor, and landscaping (it used to be a plant nursery). The bar and the entire palapa area is thoughtfully staged, decorated, and set up for comfort. The bartender is friendly and fun. The hosts are fantastic!

The barking dogs and crowing roosters are all part of the Todos Santos experience, so you can use the provided ear plugs if needed. If you are unsteady on your feet like I am you might want to use a cane to get around the uneven and sometimes steep grounds. Like many places in Mexico, this hotel was not designed to accommodate those with mobility issues. Oh, and check out the book in your room with local recommendations. Very helpful.",50,1211

"Great place with super kind staff. We rented out the whole place and again, everyone was so kind and accommodating.   Yes, the dogs are incessantly loud, but that’s entirely out of the control of the hotel.   Completely walkable to the cute streets of Todos Santos.   Would recommend that the owners purchase white noise machines for the rooms. That may help.",50,1211
"Very cute hotel. Unfortunately, it is across the street from two houses that have over 15 dogs that bark INCESSANTLY from 4pm to dawn.  It isn't possible to sleep through it.

The Paradero blends in with it's surrounds. Immersed and beautifully blended into the farm community, mountains, desert and ocean that encircle it. I admit, we were not sure what to expect and when we arrived it was a lot more ""natural"" than expected. Meaning the grounds are mostly dirt--groomed of course but not going to work for the multiple pairs of heals I brought. Luckily I like to laugh at myself and can easily adapt to most things. From there our fantastic adventure began...  Check-in was lovely...filled with smiling helpful faces in the open air living room. We were welcomed and",50,1212
" informed we would be the first people to stay in the Master Casita. Ok, now that was cool. I'm pretty sure I've never been the first person to stay in a room before, we felt quite lucky. Particularly, since there is only one. They also took the time to say that because no one had stayed there previously that they suspected they may have overlooked a few details and would also like our feedback on anything we would like to see added etc. We were given a brief preview of the property and experiences offered and then promptly shown to our room.  The Master Casita is 3 levels - the ground floor has an open air seating area, mini bar with coffee maker, filtered water and other amenities. Behind a set of sliding door is a living room that could be used as a bed. Theres a also a powder room on that level and lastly a beautiful dining table off to the side. think there is a hammock possibly being added to the area but the table as there were hooks but not one there.  Ascend the set of stairs up to the bedroom and you have a large space with a king bed, side tables, a built In seating area, open closet and a small dresser to store your things, safe as well for your valuables. Also on that level is your master bath with indoor but outdoor air shower. This area is spacious and the set up works well.  Make your way up to your third level and you find yourself on a pretty substantial rooftop deck with sky net, four lounges, a round tub and fire pit. The view is is perfect here...you see everything - farm, mountains, desert, and ocean. It's stunning! We loved our roof top!  Now onto the experiences: We went on the landscape tour and it was relaxed yet informative. You get a better sense of what they are working to achieve there and how. Our guide also followed up after when she realized she made a mistake on something. Love that kind of follow up and honesty.  Taco Tour was next on our agenda. Don't miss that! It was extremely enjoyable. Diego is a hoot and knowledgable. The three places we stopped were amazing! I added beer and the Mezcal tasting to mine. Not necessary but it's a nice way to cap off the experience and I'm happy I did it. My husband did not but I shared a little with him along the way. BTW, if you go on this tour eat breakfast early or not at all. We were all stuffed mid way through out second stop.  The last experience we participated in was Mountain Biking. I'm not much of a mountain biker but for some reason I wanted to do this. We had a blast! Intimidating but our instructor and guide made it doable for all levels. No judgement and if you need to walk that bike, you can. Most of us did. :) The reward of the spectacular view is so worth it! And because of the great instruction I was able to ride down some terrain I would have never done on my own!  When you return, you do a nice little yoga session to stretch out and that too was met with a very caring instructor. It was a perfect adventure!  Lastly, and maybe most important is the food at this hotel. Chef Eduardo and team are spectacular!!!! The serving staff and manager also make dining and the bar offerings extremely special. We had some of the most delicious food ever! The woodfire preparation, perfect! Chef made us a special oyster dish that was out of this world. The Shrimp, Baja Taco, salsa macha, fish of the day, tostada...desserts...breakfast all fabulous and truly things dreams are made of. I will say the French toast, which I ordered on the day of departure, was the best I've ever had. Every component was perfection!!! I can not do justice to the care we were given and the culinary delight we experienced. The overview... we believe this is the first hotel the owners have done. They have completely nailed it with the employees they hired. The vision is unique in many way. What's amazing is that even with some things that are missing or maybe not quite ready the people are there to make it work. They want you to be happy, they genuinely want your experience to be great. With that said, relax, give constructive feedback but don't get uptight. I promise you will have a wonderful time!  We can not wait to return, it was truly magical in so many ways.   Couple of notes: This is a work in progress in many ways. Items are still being installed in some cases. They are still sourcing amenities for the rooms such as eco toiletries, robes and slippers.  The spa is not open but they have a temporary room for messages and treatments. What is the spa area looks amazing!  I didn't ask but got the impression it would be ready soon. Access to the beach is by car but that too is being worked on for the future.  My concerns for this property when rain/storms come. I'm not sure with all the open air areas and the dirt paths how that will work. Nor am I sure how the master casita will fair as the upper level stair are open air to the bedroom level. Same with the lower area. Luckily it doesn't rain much in that area so maybe my concerns are unwarranted.",50,1212

One of the most magical hotel experiences I’ve ever had.

Also the catamaran experience is a must!  Cant wait to go back.,50,1212

Paraderos Omakase is a must! Their creative menu paired with incredible drinks and mexican influence makes it unique.",50,1212

Although we didn't eat here we enjoyed lazing by the pool on the rooftop enjoying drinks and relaxing. Very relaxed and calm atmosphere and in a great location.  We couldn't fault this place - it was great to have all the creature comforts of a great hotel in a traditional Mexican setting.",50,1213

The staff was super-friendly, the facility is lovely and conveniently located in Todos Santos. Our room was large with a separate  seating area and nicely appointed.  The bathroom was spacious, had a stall shower and beautiful copper soaking tub. The breakfast staff was friendly and very accommodating to our requests. We spent both afternoons on the rooftop pool and the sunsets are not to be missed. We didn't experience the beach club.",50,1213
"As one reviewer puts it, Guaycura, the hotel itself, is ""friendly and charming"". The rooftop bar and swimming pool have some amazing views and the location is perfect to visit Todos Santos itself. Particularly interesting is a boutique just down the street which has all sorts of esoteric, pretty, and special, knickknacks from Mexico and the world.  Where Guaycura really comes into its own, though, is at its restaurant (El Faro) and its Beach Club. Located a few minutes south (towards Los Cabos), on a gorgeous strip of windswept beach, they are accessible on a dirt road that comes in from Baja California's Highway 1.  I don't know what it is about that area, but there is a peacefulness that saturates the place. The food at both the beach club and the restaurant are excellent,",50,1213
" too. The ceviche Todos Santos, in particular, is the best I've had... and I've had a lot of ceviche ;-).  Todos Santos is a very special destination that seems like its set apart from time and Guaycura is the best way to experience it.",50,1213
…,30,1213
"My sister and I stayed at The Guaycura and had a great experience! The booking was very easy and we were also able to book some excursions (local hiking guided tour, swimming with whale sharks in La Paz) that really made our trip fantastic. Salvador was very responsive over email and helped set up all our excursions.  The hotel is very cute inside with well appointed rooms and tasteful decorations. The best part of the hotel is that they have a rooftop bar and swimming pool/lounge area where you can sit and watch the sun set over the ocean. You also have free access to the El Faro Beach Club, which is great since the surf is too intense to swim from the Todos Santos beaches. We would absolutely stay again!",50,1213
"The hotel is very quaint and charming and the room was lovely. Beautiful decor throughout and wonderful curated art collection.  However, our room had no hot water for the 2 nights we were there.  Maintenance was prompt to come when called but did not resolve the problem.  We were told that we just needed to run the water for a few moments however we ran the water for a least 5 minutes and did not get anything beyond tepid water.  The breakfast was vastly overpriced ($45US for 2 places of huevos rancheros, 1 coffee and 1 tea).  I'd probably return and recommend it it wasn't for the lack of hot water.",50,1213
"We stayed at this delightful boutique hotel twice on our recent trip to the Baja area.  The first trip we stayed in a Classic King room and the second time in a larger suite.  Both rooms were lovely.  Well appointed and both had large bathrooms with huge showers.  The rooftop sky lounge has a stunning sunset view overlooking the ocean in the distance and definitely worth visiting.  The beach club is truly amazing!  It's about a 10 minute drive and a must do.  Gorgeous stretch of sandy beach, cabanas, small pool and great food/drink service.  Access to the beach club makes the hotel the perfect choice between the charm of Todo Santos and staying on the beach.  In the morning, look for Taller 17, a tiny coffee and bakery shop just 1/2 block away from hotel.  Best baked goods fresh",10,1213
" from their oven and perfect latte's.  At night, look for MJOL pizza (Miguel) in the outdoor Plaza Amigos on mainstreet.  Both are great examples of young entrepreneurs who are contributing to a ground swell of great food in this charming small town.   It was so nice to stay in a place that felt like a relaxing home away from home.  ",50,1213
"We spent 8 days in the Santa Barbara suite! The room was super spacious! It was clean, bright and welcoming  Housekeeping arrived at the same time daily and kept the rooms spotless.   The beds were super comfortable, the best I’ve ever slept on in Mexico. I would say this room has two full sized beds, rather Queen though.  The location was convenient to downtown.  Easy walk to lots of restaurants!   Mini-supers were near by if you wanted to buy groceries.   The pool was clean, quiet and surrounded by beautiful gardens.   The veranda with this room was very large - perfect place to enjoy your morning coffee(provided) and listen to all of the birds.  It feels private, exclusive and romantic.  We loved this little slice of Eden and we will certainly be back",50,1214
Wonderful location that feels secluded while in the middle of everything. Easy walk to the town playground and ice cream shops. Absolutely loved the accommodations for our family with plenty of space for everyone. The pool was our kids favorite place to hangout.  Felt like our own personal paradise.,50,1214

"My husband and I stayed at Hacienda Todos Los Santos for 4 nights. We had such an excellent stay. This is a true boutique hotel. The property is absolutely gorgeous.   The location is 5/5! It’s pretty much walking distance to everything in town, but it’s still tucked away in its own little oasis. At night, you can hear the waves crashing from your bedroom. It’s very pleasant to listen to.   Cleanliness is 5/5. Everything was spotless. The cleaning ladies clean every little nook and cranny every single day! The bed was very comfortable. All the sheets, linens and towels smelled so good and were spiffy clean.   Value 5/5. You just cannot beat the price. You can’t! You get the most bang for your buck.  Service 5/5. The check-in & check-out process can’t be any simpler. It was all",50,1214
" so seamless. Luis from the front desk walked us through everything. He was so warm, welcoming, and kind. The cleaning ladies were marvelous! The groundskeeper work tirelessly day in and day out to maintain the beauty of this property.   Amenities 4/5. The pool was amazing!  I do wish there were more loungers though. There weren’t enough for all the guests. The in-suite bar area with the mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster (fully stocked with coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, silverware, plates, etc.) was a huge plus! I do wish for a minor upgrade with the bathroom amenities though (i.e. new hairdryer, more refined toiletries). P.S. the shower was great! The water pressure was 100% and the water temperature was scorching hot!",50,1214

"We stayed for 4 nights in the Suite San Juan Diego - we loved it. Super spacious, beautiful design and has everything you need. The location is great, just on the edge of town, easy to walk to all the shops and restaurants. Luis, who runs the hotel, was very helpful and got us set up with a COVID test for the flight back (he arranged a time and they came to the hotel room - fast and easy) and also a trip for us to Isla Espiritu Santo (recommend!). I swam at the pool once and it was very enjoyable. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is not room service or restaurant, but I honestly prefer to just bring a beer from the kitchen in our room to the pool. Easy! A couple we met at the Isla excursion was staying at a nice hotel I had looked at and they were commenting that they",50,1214

"The main building just in front of the toll gates on the highway, has basic rooms, but other rooms are available in two other areas in town, one just around the corner and the nice ones which they advertise with a little further down that same road.   So we stayed in what they called the King Rooms, which are 4 rooms on a parking lot close to the main road. a bit strange location for a hotel.  But all worked fine, there is a gate, security cameras, and although there is a lot of noise from the main road, I slept fine.   Nice hot shower, very firm mattress, and a bit wonky pillows. The room smelled of cigarette smoke.   Check-in was very unfriendly and unprofessional. the insisted on having our passports, which we refused. So they were kind of confused about our refusal, made a",30,1215

For an overnight stay a good place, because it is very clean and if you travel onward,  a superb location, close to the main road.   The wifi is good by the way.   Not many COVID rules and regulations inside the hotel.   Rooms are 500 MXN per night, a bit over the top for such a basic hotel.",30,1215

"We didnt stay at the hotel but we ate at the reataurant. We ordered the soft crabs  (jaibas), fish and fish fillet and all was awesome. Fairly priced and delicious cooking.  Order just one dish as the plates are big so no dessert. Congrats to the owners.",50,1216
"This is my 4th visit to Hotel San Cristobal and every time I go fall more in love with this property and Todos Santos.  The hotel is beautifully tucked into a cove off a stretch of dirt road.  We typically never leave the property but if you do there are many good restaurants now in Todos Santos.  Benno the restaurant at the hotel is by far the best option though .  From breakfast to dinner the food is fresh, innovative and delicious. We usually get an ocean view room and love the size and view from the room.   There are many great hikes from the property that go to other beautiful coves and in one area you can see many sea lions tanning on the rocks.  The beach in front of the hotel is beautiful and clean.  And a great sunset view every night we are there. It’s also a beautiful",50,1217

The best part is the service at this hotel,every waiter, housekeeper, front desk person is extremely nice and go over and beyond to make our trip perfect.  Although I’ve in the past rented a car and drove the 45 minutes from the Cabo airport, I used Todos Santos Private Transportation this time and had great service !",50,1217

We went over New Years 2020-2021 and the covid protocol is on point, there are very few people staying there (small hotel), the scenery and rooms are astounding and the staff is so incredibly nice. Dolce absolutely made the experience. She is phenomenal. I cried when I left since she was just so very nice. I can't wait to go back!",50,1217
"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, but what really impressed us was the help we got from Daniel at the front desk. He was incredibly kind, understanding and went out of his way to assist us. We were here for a wedding and it was absolutely stunning, wonderful attention to detail. Great rooms! Still, Daniel's assistance was the highlight. Thank you!!",30,1217
"We spent six nights at HSC with our two adult kids. We had a fabulous time. The hotel is beautifully situated on a gorgeous, quiet beach just a ten-minute drive to Todos Santos. The hiking trails are incredible. And so many whales swimming by! The property is really lovely. Everywhere your eye lands is a thoughtful design detail. Yes, it's instagram friendly, but it's also legitimately pretty. Our rooms were simple but spacious and comfortable. We loved the sitting areas and indoor/outdoor showers. The common spaces are also great. We never had an issue finding pool chairs or cozy spots for sunset cocktails (the drinks are amazing!). The food is wonderful, at both the pool bar and at Benno.

"My husband and I have wanted to stay here for a while! We booked 3 nights after staying at a different hotel in downtown Todos and we have been underwhelmed. The food and location are top notch — but the service does not match what you pay for. They did not clean are room 2 of the days we stayed there, there are not enough lounge chairs to accommodate the # of guests they have, they care more about the photos one might post to Instagram than actually providing top level service.   The food is outstanding and decently priced. The location is exceptional — with access to a great swimming beach and hiking trails.   However, given the price/room @ $600/night all in — I would not stay here again — I would just come for dinner. Disappointed but thankful we didn’t book our whole trip",50,1217

Lovely setting of 12 rooms around a decent sized pool and covered table areas with a cafe. Rooms are generously sized with comfortable beds. AC worked really well but not needed during the day as fan and cross ventilation was enough. Plenty of hot water in the large shower. Importantly it had screens over the windows and doors going to the terrace or balcony. A class act. Good food at Don Guillermo resteraunt on the beach to the left of the tourist pier. Street has a galleon ship at its start. Very chill relaxed place but closes up early.,40,1218
"What a sanctuary. A beautiful garden light comfy clean rooms with wonderful paintings, lovely pool, super hospitable hosts. The beach is about a 10 minute walk away and we had it to ourselves. Great cafes on the beach with delicious seafood. Wonderful pelican watching.",50,1218

The function of the WiFi was back and forth. ",30,1219

Admiten mascotas (con un depósito de $500 ) solamente no permiten que las dejes solas en la habitación.  Hay bastantito ruido en la calle por la mañana, si te gusta dormir después de las 6, lleva tapones para los oídos.  Tienen un buen protocolo de COVID-19, todo está super limpio y bonito.  Cuentan con estacionamiento y elevador. El personal es súper amable y está cerca del malecón y de toda a linea costera más nueva. Lo recomiendo muchísimo.",50,1221

The wifi in the room didn't work too well on my iPhone. In the lobby it works much better. There is no bar. The book in the room states there is. The price for the night is slightly less then competitors. The shower has a hard time keeping a consistent temperature. We are moving to the Hampton Inn for the last two nights of our stay. There are two bars, as advertised. We will see if it is true. ",50,1223

The main highway to Campeche or Tabasco is not far either.    The free breakfast was tasty especially the eggs cooked to order.  There was a variety of juices and, of course plenty of coffee.  The property has a lovely pool area.  The staff was great and extremely helpful.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",40,1223
"A great place to work as it is very well equipped by an office station and several meeting rooms. When you get to your room you can see the marvelous ocean view and the mattress is memory foam (you will want to have that bed at home). The breakfast has a vast selection from fruit, chilaquiles, any style of eggs, and waffles. There is a fitness center, although it is well equipped I recommend you go to the beach for a walk. It will take you 6 minutes from the front desk to the ocean shore, something distinctive of this hotel. One of the best qualities is the staff members that are always kind and trying to make you feel the Mexican hospitality. I am surely booking my next visits now before their opening rate changes!",30,1223

Klein aber fein. Aber leider kein Safe vorhanden.  Absolut ungünstig für Raucher, ich musste immer ewig weit runter bis in den Innenhof latschen, und nichtmal dort gibt es jegliche Art von Aschenbechern. Im Gegensatz zu Küchenschaben, bewusst plural, die einem über den Fuss kriechen. Das Hotel liegt ziemlich in der Stadt, in der Nähe gibt es einen Oxxo (mexikanischer Mini-Edeka), eine Wäscherei, Taquerias usw. Aber bis zum Meer sind es schon so ein, zwei Kilometer zu Fuß.

You share the 'desk' with the TV, and the chair puts you way below a comfortable working height. These are minor gripes. Here's why you shouldn't say here:  1. The shower will not provide hot water. After 15 minutes, the best I got was just the right side of uncomfortably cold. 2. Contrary to the summary, no one here speaks English. 3. If you use room service, order your food 2 hours before you want it: After 5 minutes on hold, you ask the operator for room service. Practice your Spanish, English gets you nowhere. After another 10 minutes, you get some other guy. He'll ask you to call back in 20 minutes. Call back - repeat the above loops, but this time all you",10,1226

We stayed two nights at the City Express hotel in Ciudad del Carmen in the Playa Norte area.  The hotel was clean and above average for Mexico.  Breakfast was included.  The pool was nice as our stay was in May during the hottest time of the year.  The hotel is also located across the street from the beach and next to a couple good restaurants.,40,1227
This is similar to another review on a budget hotel I wrote in Valladolid.  Budget means you should expect less but asking for a bathroom that does not have part of the ceiling molded is not asking too much... The positive point of the breakfast was that it was free but I would prefer to pay a bit for something tasteful ..  In short if you compare with some budget hotels like Ibis - Holliday Inn Express .. in similar price ranges in Europe this chain has a lot to learn on balancing quality versus price. ,20,1227
"The Hotel is located in an area where you have access to so much.  There are restaurants, attractions, the beach and public transportation to take you anywhere!  The hotel staff was always friendly and professional. Upon my arrival I was given an option to choose my room, I got one at top with an ocean view, it was awesome.  The room had a single bed and was ""small"" but perfect for business. Again this place is a great hotel to stay in and ideally located.",50,1227

Since the check in we were told about a free breakfast at 7am (from Monday to Friday is at 6:30am), we thought it would be just coffee and some bread but we also found fruit, chilaquiles and eggs, all of them really tasty. Bedroom tidy, comfortable, no luxury, just the basic for you to rest. There is no restaurant in the hotel and for room service there are only 2 options, either a seafood restaurant or Dominos Pizza. Unfortunately none of them answered but we found out there are some restaurants right beside the hotel.  Pretty fast wifi, also. Would love to come back!",50,1227

"I have seen other reviews and I agree that the staff is not very welcoming, especially in the desk. However, the cleaning staff is very trusted, despite they used to get into the room even when I was asking for privacy, a point to improve. Everything else is just what is expected from an economic chain. Room was clean and big enough. The screen was ok IMO, water was fine and noise isolation is just average. AC was great. Breakfast is good for what is expected, again, from these hotels. Location is awesome, just in front of the beach. WiFi was slow, but it was just ok. One of the lifts needs to improve, it was hard not only for me but for other guests, to use the card reader, and this is a MUST to fix. I was there for 14 days and I have to say it was fine for me.",40,1227
"We arrived at 2:45pm when check-in is supposed to be at 3pm. Usually hotels are accommodating, but the City Express employees behind the desk just kept going about their ""work"" and avoided eye contact after telling me check in was at 3pm. We stood with our confirmation information in front of the desk until one of the employees begrudgingly took the information and checked us in. Since she didn't hand us a room key we asked and she said they would give us the room at 3pm and went back to cutting out something from a piece of paper. At 3pm we went back up to the desk and the computer wasn't working to give us our keys, so the manager went up with us and let us in. The room was clean, very basic, but the handle on the outside of our door was broken, although it still locked",30,1227

This is a very nice hotel with excellent service and the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel of any brand. I am a Hilton diamond member because I find the breakfast at Holiday Inn Express in the US to be boring The value here is excellent (I got the best deal booking directly with Holiday Inn) and the rooms are clean and spacious. There are a few bars across the street which are a little noisy but you cannot hear them in the room. Parking is plentiful and secure. The exercise room on the 5th floor is top notch with a beautiful view. The location is central to the airport and downtown with most restaurants rips taking less than 10 minutes. Cabs are plentiful but they drive like maniacs. We rented a car instead. The hotel has a free shuttle from the airport. ,50,1228
"Great staff. Breakfast is included, good mexican cooking plus granola, yogurt and fruit. A three choice juice, nice. You can have a sound breakfast. Although they don't serve lunch  or dinner, for free they arrange a shuttle to the other Holiday Inn to have a meal or drinks. Happy hour is for free is a nice treat for guests. The rooms are neat, comfortable. Efficient wi-fi, though sometimes in the bathroom the signal is lost. A small fridge in in the room so you can fill it with snacks and drinks. The pool is not big, but is like an oversized jacuzzi, helps you relax during Happy Hour.",50,1228
"It is a comfortable hotel to stay in, rooms are spacious and staff are friendly. Breakfast is almost the same everyday but otherwise it is tasty. Location is near to supermarkets, Lapa Lapa and eateries. Next to the hotel is a sports complex which hotel guests can use for the running track and facilities. It is near the airport about 10-15 mins drive. Check out the bistro opposite the hotel which has carpet grass, you can still connect to the free hotel wifi so you can spend lunch or coffee there catching up on work or just enjoying a good book.",40,1228
This is a very nice new Holiday Inn Express.  Nicer and fancier looking than any Holiday Inn Express I have been to.  The breakfast is very superior to the regular Holiday Inn express hotels in the U.S.  Friendly service and great meeting rooms.  Our company had a training meeting at one of their conference rooms and we were impressed. ,50,1228
"Staff friendly and helpful. Room clean, bed comfortable although the pillows are lumpy. Good WiFi. Breakfast offered and is sufficient for my taste. musli, yoghurt serial etc. no lunch, dinner or bar service which is why I say limited. Room service available although I did not try it. To cater for the lack of food and drink they offer a free shuttle back and forth between this location and other Holiday Inn hotel. That works well. Bar only opens at 7pm!,, anyway all in all its just fine for a business trip when there's little time to relax and socialize.",30,1228
"The room had spartan furnishings, few outlets, a boring decor, a tiny bath, and smelled like wet towels. I choose the location to be close to immigration where I needed to complete paperwork. I have no idea why anyone would choose this hotel for a vacation destination since it is a distance to centro, and to the beach. Restaurants are a hike, and taxis have become very expensive in Playa.For the price, it is a huge disappointment.",20,1228
"The hotel has the same looks of all Holiday In Express. The room has a good size, air conditioned works well and the shower is good. It is close to the downtown, since the city is small. The breakfas is ok. Very good for business trips",30,1228
"Just had to find a place for the night and this hotel was close to the highway. Good choice, they have parking, a swimming pool (which we didn't use) and nice patio rooms that go out to the pool, pretty quiet. The restaurant served surprisingly good food.",30,1229
"I found myself in Ciudad Carmen overnight and checked into Hotel Real.  Maybe they had just mopped but the place smelled like Fabuloso detergent and disinfectant.  Bar was closed, restaurant was empty but took an order for a cocktail.  I waited by pool area which had dirty tile and dirty table top.  Seemed like drink would never be served.  Waited what seemed like forever. I even went to restaurant and asked if they were making it. It finally showed up.  Intended to take a swim after long hot drive but pool was rented out to a group of chubby women doing water aerobics to very loud Mexican disco music and a coach with a microphone yelling the moves.  Wasn’t the most tranquil cocktail moment I have ever had.  I opted to eat elsewhere and found a very good taqueria a couple blocks",20,1229
" toward the airport.  El Vaquero I believe.  Other than the disinfectant smell, dirty pool area, poor drink service and pool full of loud chubby women the room was clean and otherwise comfortable. It was ok for one night transient stay.  Wouldn’t have wanted another night. ",40,1229

Stayed in this hotels for many times. Amazing place to relax after tough two months work on offshore.  Rooms are nice with comfy bed's and well cleaned. Good Wifi connection. Restaurant has good choice of food. Breakfast is excellent.  For pool users they have good and well maintained pool.,50,1229
"The Hacienda Real is a good hotel with friendly staff. There's nothing better than a shower, cold beer and wifi after a six hour crewboat ride from the oil fields.   I can recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Carmen.   Suggestion for improvement: English speaking TV channels!",40,1229
I stayed in this Hotel for 1 night in Sep2015 and now again in Oct2015.It's a nice Hotel very near to Airport.Ambience of Restaurant is perfect and good tasty food.Rooms and Bathrooms are very neat and clean.Bed is perfectly arranged.Staff is very friendly and helpful.Just across the road is MEGA Superstore which was very handy to do some shopping before I leave for Mumbai.Overall a very good experience staying here.,40,1229
"Stayed at this hotel several times in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Nice and clean rooms(but no refrigerator if you are not on the suite). Nice pool and friendly staff if you take into account that everything takes time in Mexico. The restaurant I can't recommend. ",30,1229
Stayed here on our trip back to the US and will stay here again. Great food in their restaurant. Pool was nice for the day. This is an oil service town so keep that in mind. The rooms were like a Holiday inn. Lobby was very pretty with restaurant and pool visible.,40,1229
12 years since last trip.  This time was provided a room at the back end. Very poor state and dated.  Needs a good makeover.   Front end of the hotels looks great.  Bar and restaurant in decent state.  Has character.   Location convenient location for us on work assignments.  Huge supermarket across the main drag. ,40,1229
"What did we like? The room was nothing special but fine. We swimming pool area is great to hang out around. The gym has a lot of equipment, although most of it could definitely use a refresh. Probably the nicest amenity was having access to a pair of free washers and dryers (you can buy detergent at the hypermarket two blocks away).   All this said, the property is a bit dated. As a IHG platinum member, in retrospect I wish I had booked the newer Holiday Inn Express nearby.",30,1230
"Probably the best hotel in town ! Quite charming with its hacienda-like style, surrounding a nice garden with a welcoming swimming-pool. Staff is friendly, but tends to be a bit slow (or sometimes ignore you) in the restaurant. Rooms are good but not great : good bed, very clean, lots of space but quite damp (if you don't leave the AC all day) and a great lack of decoration (oldish armchair, a single ikea-style picture on the walls) which makes the whole impression a bit ""cold"". The bathroom is also really old-style, probably from the the 80-90's, but functionnal. This is one of the signs the building would need a little freshening up (that and the old window panes, the few stains on the outside walls : it is not decrepit at all, just aging) A bit noisy also, especially rooms",40,1230
" with street view.  The restaurant gives me mixed impressions: not too bad and probably the only place in Carmen where you will find vegetables, but clearly overpriced for the city (imagine a standard cafeteria-level meal for the price of a local top restaurant) Last, the airport shuttle is quite convenient and the location is good, not too far from the center and the main malls.",30,1230
…,30,1230
"This is a okay hotel with good prices. Nicea and friendly staff. But in the restaurant they don't speak English so it could be a litle hard to order food, the rooms are okay, bad showers and bathtubs. Nice sportsbar on the top floor. ",30,1230
I stayed here 2 nights only during  our meetings in CdC. the hotel is quite clean and well maintained;  the bar on the 4th floor is really nice and if you are an IHG u have 2 free beer every night. breakfast are ok. Yes I can recommend it for a shot stay. ,40,1230
"Love the staff specially the ladies at the front desk always willing to help and friendly. This is a nice hotel that got stuck in the 80’s as far as the rooms is concerned. They are clean, if just a little tired looking. Restaurant is decent specially during breakfast, the ladies at the griddle station know what they are doing. Shuttle to and from airport is free and convenient, it is also sometimes available for near drops but don’t count on it. All and all is adequate but not premium. However not a lot of premium choices in Carmen. Holiday Inn Express about three blocks away is a little newer.",40,1230
Hotel is old but the basics are good. Love the breakfast which is very Mexican.  Gym is large with numerous cardio machine but only dumbbell  s and a  cable machine for weights. Air con is very strong which thankfully is crucial in Carmen.  Only 5 mins from hotel. ,30,1230
I stayed 1 night during my trip to Carmen. Room was fine and food in restaurant was ok. This is a basic hotel for short stay and enough to get a good rest. Staff was very friendly and receptionist was very kind.,50,1230
"Passed through CDC and stayed here. Was a little noisy but was a place to hang hat for one night. Out of Doble rooms but got an added bed for price of course. The breakfast was pretty good especially since it was included, hotel price was competitive. Fruit was very fresh!",40,1230
"During my stay at this hotel, I really enjoyed the attention of the staff. All the staff was prone to help and assist. It's location is extraordinary, the surroundings are full of restaurants and places were to spend time are just few steps away. I surely come back to this place.",50,1231
Very nice hotel very comfort and stuff eas amazing i likr it much and hope visit it again soon . Good value for the money too . I recommenda everyone visit this hotel . They offers free breakfast too . ,30,1231
"I would recommend this hotel, in general is very good, the price is fair for what you get. The staff is friendly with just one little problem when I did the check out, the girl in there told me that I should have checked out 1 hour before since it was 5 pm but I just arrived there that day, so I didn't even stay for one night, but just a few hours, even so she wanted me to pay for another night?? so for the next time I believe they should check when you arrived before even trying to suggest that you should pay for another night. Except for that, the stay in there was good and I like the hotel just that incident made the stay not so pleasant.",40,1231
"This hotel is good in general, the price is good for what you get, you even get free breakfast, and free wi fi, the connection was ok not the best but at least it worked. The room was clean and had a good size for what you pay, don't expect a big room. The only thing that needs a little bit more attention is to have nicer persons at the front desk but I don't have a complain just they weren´t so so friendly, but it is ok no complains, good hotel in general, the location is great since it is near some restaurants and a little shopping mall. And not so far from the airport.",30,1231
hotel is very clean and staff are great. waiter service can be a bit slow but if you're not in a rush no problem Rooms are very good and impeccably clean but the AC system can be very loud. All in all though very good value for the price.,40,1232
"First they had buffet, that was good. The a la carte is not that good, eatable but no haute cuisine. Rooms are oke, only very noisy on the front near the road. For short stay, for longer stay requirements are too low.",30,1232
"The hotel experience was fine, only some noise from the hallway was getting in the room, and the food area in the restaurant could be more clean and tight. The staff is very friendly and is always willing to help with a smile.",40,1232
"One night stay, rooms in very poor conditions: AC extremely noisy and not very really working, water pipes make very loud and very strange noises. The faucet its all clogged and water sits. You can easily tell that pillows and mattresses haven't been updated in years.... All the signs of a hotel which reinvest ZERO and has no intention of doing it. Very very sad and would never stay here again. Off course the  staff tries to its best, nice caring people who know what the customers are going through with the rooms and overall condition of the building but very few they can do when evidently there is a zero maintenance management policy.",10,1232
"I came back a second time in less then a month, this time I try to order from the small menu they have, I order Cesar salad and was very surprised it was very good.  They do not have a restaurant but you can order food to your room, they have wine small selection but no to bad.  Breakfast was very good and everyone was very helpful   I arrive on my motorcycle and they were very nice at looking after the bike on the parking lot",50,1232
"Stayed for two nights. The hotel is very clean, staff is courteous but distant. The room and the bathroom were ok, big enough for the price. The hotel is very well located, with a supermarket just in the other side of the street. Shuttle service to the airport is offered free. Breakfast was ok, but not enough fruits.",40,1232
"Great service, rooms and breakfast!!! We definitely recommend this place. We stayed in many places and this was the best during our travels! Staff was accommodating, bed was very comfortable and breakfast was excellent, many choices. Thanks for our stay!",50,1232
"First, the hotel staff are pleasant and attentive, but the hotel needs some repair. First I did reserve a room with a king, but that was not available and was given two doubles.   Second the shower was broken and the sink did not drain. there was a HDIM cable broken and hanging from the TV. I did not discover shower issue until I was already standing there nor did I discover the sink issue until I was shaving which was a bit of challenge.   I did report the issue with the shower and the guy and fixed it right away, but it was after the fact. Don't know about the other stuff.   That is why I would say that they are attentive and nice..   Lastly.. the lobby and bar area were over run by mosquitos.. so tough to sit and have a quiet drink at the end of the day.",20,1232
"Very peaceful place to unwind and stay. Clean room and the staff are service oriented...Food is Great!!! Facilities are beyond expectation...very near to anywhere like hospital, mall, supermarket , fast food and restaurant. It is highly recommendable place for your friends to stay and relax.",50,1232
"Excellent service, amenities, and staff. Food of good standard and bed very comfortable. Check in and Check out very easy. Efficient staff in all areas of hotel. Good internet connection and good transport service to and from airport.",50,1232
"The service and warmth that the whole staff gives you, make you feel right at home. Just the amenities of which it would be nice for a gym or a pool for the customers. Other than that the location is incredible.",50,1233
"the recepcionist had a very bad attitude, loke if he was amking me a favor or something, also it looked like he was making up requirements for my check in. other than that everything was pretty well..",30,1233
"I was on business trip and stayed in One hotel for 3 nights. The place is clean and tidy. Staff are friendly however not all could speak English. In general, a value for money accommodation especially for short business trips.",40,1233
"I stayed at this hotel for one month during August when I first moved to Ciudad del Carmen fora  new job.   The rooms were clean, the customer service was great, availability of room service, laundry service available.   The staff always smiled and greeted me when I arrived.   I was not very happy when I had to leave.    The included breakfast is a buffet style breakfast, but nothing special.",50,1233
"This hotel is in a great location, across the street from a plaza real, 5 minutes from the airport and many restaurants in the area.  The staff is friendly and willing to help.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  The breakfast has a great variety.",50,1233
"Good place, quick reception and close to anything. There's a mall, a baseball stadium and some good places to have a drink, and just in walking distance. It took me couple of minutes to figure out how to make the lights work, because there is not instrructions or previous information. However it is very good for a quick business trip. It is what it is for the price, bed, toilet, shower and cable tv.",40,1233
"The service is good, you know in advance that this is not a full service hotel.   I didn´t like the breakfast that is included, it has milk, coffee, scramble eggs, yogurt, some bread, fruit and other things.  You will have only basics in your room, the room is small, have a little ""desk"" and a small closet.   Is not allowed to smoke, but operational people don't respect this detail all the time, you can smell the smoke in your restroom (because I think they smoke in the restroom because the fire detector is in the room).",30,1233
"The room was ok, nothing special, good attention, clean! There's no gym nor pool, which could give a better stay. Internet was ok. The breakfast, average, not bad but could be much better quality. The hotel could have potential to be better.",30,1233
This hotel is good for overnight stay. Though the rooms are clean and furniture store are near new but I found it odd there was no mini-bar in the room and not even a bottle of water in the room.....this won't be too much to offer to your guest as a freebie.,30,1233
"If you don't need to be in ciudad del Carmen? Don't travel there. Just drive around it. You can get much better rooms and service for 900 pesos.   Along our trip we visited almost ten hotels of various prices. Our stay at One on Friday the 9th was definitely the least pleasurable.  Rooms are simple, clean but not decorated or comfortable.   Receptionist Ixhel took my drivers license for check-in but then forgot to return it. Thanks for the police checkpoint just outside town where we noticed.   Other staff was outside on there phone and didn't pay attention to any of our questions. Not even a good bye.  Not ""One""  friendly place to stay  ",10,1233
"Rooms were OK. Basic - but A/C worked great, rooms were clean. Beds comfortable. The drawback is the service at the front desk. Hassle over room rates - one price online, then tried to raise the price giving the excuse that rates increased over the weekend. Mistakingly overstayed my week stay by a day, and was more than happy to pay for the extra day. Unfortunately, they had not record of me paying, and tried to get me to pay again. Don't get your laundry done there. Take a cab to a laundromat - even with the cab fare, it'll be a lower price. Service training on how to deal with guests would increase the rating on this hotel by at least a point or two.",30,1234
"Stayed for 5 nights on a recent business trip. I found the staff pleasant in manner and helpful. The food was fine and the room larger than average and clean. The bar is very small, but has friendly staff and clientele. I liked the place. Perhaps the best recommendation I can give is that I shall be staying there again on my next trip to Cd del Carmen..",40,1234
"Horrible place to stay. Bedroom wasnt clean. We did book with booking.com and we we arrived at frontdesk they overcharged us for the breakfast wich was around 15$ per person. We accepted thinking that would be cool to have a buffet on the next morning! At 9am, the maid knocked at our door to ask if she could clean up the room!!! We were still sleeping...We went to the restaurant the next morning and the buffet was miserable... No much choice and nothing about breakfast.. Plus we had to argue with the waiter that thought we needed to pay, cause they didnt give any receipt when we did pay 30$  for the buffet the night before.  But the worst thing is really about the cleanliness... We found an half drank bottle of water in the room, plus few items that didnt belong in the room...",10,1234
 That probably belongs to someone that slept here the night before us!!! I dont recommand this hotel to anyone. Plus its quite fat from the center! ,10,1234

"We stayed here because we were on our way to Mérida, Yucatán by car and it looked ok on the web. The hotel is in an ok location with parking, the room was nice and clean. The only thing we didn't like was that there were no elevators and the hotel has several floors. We had to carry all of our stuff like the stroller, the baby's crib, our luggage, plus other things up to our room.",40,1235
Muy desagradable la recepción del hotel sucia y con olor a humedad. La habitación limpia pero con olor a humedad y un aire acondicionado que enfría poco. Necesitan más limpieza en todo el hotel para que los huéspedes nos sintamos a gusto y seguros. No volveré a este “hotel”,10,1235
As you would expect from a middle of the line Hotel chain in Mexico. the staff was courteous and did their best. rooms were clean and food was good when available. there is a shopping center very close by with good local and commercial food.  I would recommend if you need to stay close to the airport.,30,1236
Everything was very nice. The rooms were nice and also clean. The staff was helpful and professional.We have stayed there many times and will stay there next time we visit Cuidad de Carmen. The breakfast had a good variety and was set up for cleanliness and safety from the spread of germs.,50,1236
"The staff is extremely accommodating and do whatever they can to make your stay comfortable. Gabby , Wendy & Javier went above their duties to assist in any way they could. The only down side to my stay is that the menu is very limited but they still try to accommodate you off the menu ",40,1236
"We didn't plan to stay here, but other plans fell through and we were able to book at the last minute....I booked online in the car as we were driving to the hotel.  I walked in and they already had my reservation and check in was super easy.  Then the room....the beds and pillows were AMAZING.  We had been traveling around the Yucatan and had some hard beds previously-these were so nice, I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning.  We didn't use the pool, but looked at it and it was fine and outdoors.  We did enjoy the complimentary breakfast before we took off in the morning.  We also had a couple beers in the bar and the prices were higher than typical for MX.  But, the front desk help was amazing-even helped us order pizza.  I would highly recommend this hotel.   We were",50,1236

"A great price for a Hyatt Place (which doesn't vary much from property to property). I stayed for a few nights.  I was able to park out front (or on the side) each night.  There are a lot of traveling business employees that are staying here. Many work crews as well.  At first Google Maps took me into the parking of the mall that is on the wrong side of a wall but it wasn't a big deal to come back out to the main road, go up a couple of blocks and make a u-turn before pulling into the hotel.  I was surprised by the size of the airport (or lack thereof). My hotel room looked out away from the water - over the church and some of the city.  Not a problem.  Wifi worked as expected.  I made the mistake of not putting the do-not-disturb placard on the door one morning.  Housekeeping",50,1236
" came in and sort of cleaned the room - didn't change out the towels.  Made the bed.  I felt bad about the underwear and clothes sitting on the floor - oops. They were left as is. LOL.  I went outside to use the pool - didn't find any towels.  I was probably supposed to use those in the room.  Everything was clean.  One morning there were no utensils for breakfast. I wouldn't rate this property above average, but it was more than acceptable.    The mall does have some dining options (Bostons Pizza/sports bar, Dominos Pizza, Pizza Hut - sense the theme?).  There is a grocery store (Bodega Aurrera) to the left and down the main road in front of the hotel. Honestly, it was good for picking up some cold beer but I wasn't at all impressed.   Given the low cost, I would stay here again and feel like it was a bargain.  Thank you.",30,1236

"We were pleased to find somewhere easy to get to, where they spoke English ( we try but our Spanish is very very limited unfortunately !) The car park is watched over day and night. A luggage trolley was available and easy access to the upper rooms with a large lift. A shame that they had « air fresheners » squirting out of the ceiling in the corridors - the smell was too strong and made it difficult to breath. Complimentary breakfast was not really breakfast consisting only of a fruit and a piece of bread with nowhere to sit to eat.  Coffee is free all day on the other hand",40,1237

This hotel was very clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. We only stayed one night but we had  a group so had three rooms and all were nice. We will be making this trip again next year and plan on staying here again.  The breakfast was great too!,40,1238
"Don't stay here. I normally don't write reviews, but this was so so much, that I decided to write it.  We had to stay at this place, because it wasn't any other room available in town. We wasn't expecting something fancy or spacious, but something clean at least...... The first thing I noticed as soon we entered in to the room was long black thick hairs on the floor, uugggg!!!, I mean... Did they clean the room? Then, the bathroom... Full of pubic hair on the floor...... I almost died...... Then the next question , did they change the blankets ? Of course not !!!!!!!! The pillow cover with dirty spots and the blanket with some hairs. We requested either to get a new room, or at least a room cleaning. They gave us a new room, but at soon we enter on the new room, the same",10,1238

"Well....I’ll start by saying that I’m a dyed in the wool Hilton man!  I’ve spent decades wandering the globe causing chaos and creating havoc.  Hilton has that canny knack of delivering wonderfully almost every time.  There’s something unique about the way they treat you and run their hotels.  I love them all.....  On arrival at the Hampton Inn in Ciudad del Carmen I was underwhelmed.  Carmen is a dusty one horse town dedicated, in the most part, to the oil industry.  Well I wasn’t expecting anything special but I was a shade depressed upon entering what looks like a Chinese built hotel with the usual flimsy fittings and ‘fixtures’.  The bar and restaurant are stark, soulless and the breakfast hall akin to the NAAFI or military canteen in international speak for civvies et al. ",50,1239
" My room was basic and zero views.  However.....the food was more than edible, the service impeccable from the Bell Hop to the waitresses and the receptionists.  This is, I think,  a 3 star affair but with a full on 5 star service....!!!!  It behoves me to mention that I arrived at the height of Covid 19 but nothing was too much for this splendid team.  Francia the young lady at reception was outstandingly lovely and made my visit a Royal treat.  The lads in the bar and restaurant and canteen were all wonderfully positive and helpful and attentive.  Many 5 star restaurants could learn a great deal from this crew!!!!!  I had little reason to leave the hotel and being ‘locked down’ there was a ‘delight’ .  There’s an excellent little pool and a gym that is perfectly usable and workable.  SO....I unreservedly recommend this hotel for someone that is working in the area and requires a no frills stopover as well as an extremely reasonably well priced hotel.  It isn’t close to anything other than the Golf and Country Club (1 Km away)so all destinations require a taxi ride.    I’d like to beg the management to seriously consider setting up the restaurant and bar adjacent to the pool or find a piece of real estate outside with shade and a garden.  If not work hard on making the bar/restaurant and canteen homely and welcoming.  Excellent job.",20,1239

"We booked this place while literally fleeing in a taxi from a supposedly 4.5 star resort in Playacar that was so awful we left four days before our check out date.  So, it was luck (not skill) that landed us at Alea Tulum.  This place is modern yet beachy, small yet dairy/open, and offers great service and lovely food/drinks.  We booked in a way that included breakfast (which offers a great selection and generous portions) and the mini bar (which I highly recommend because the tap water in the Yucatan is brackish and almost undrinkable).  They use a website to order room service meals and drinks, but it wasn't a great system, so I recommend ordering either by phone or in person.  But the food is amazing.  Honestly, it's some of the best food I had during our multi city, five",50,1240
" week your of Mexico.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, with great amenities and everything you could want.  The upper rooms have balconies with unobstructed views of the sea.  The lower rooms have direct access to the pool, which is cool, clean, and lovely.  The beach has its share of seaweed, and the sandy part is not wide like you'd find further north in Quintana Roo.  But if you aren't planning to do much swimming in the sea, it's not a big problem.  There's also a dock where you can sit and even receive a massage and/or facial on (I highly recommend this).  This place is best for couples or small groups who want a relaxing, upscale experience - no watered down drinks, no booming techno music starting at 9 am by the pool, and no aggressive beach sellers or overpriced excursions/timeshare hawkers.  I know this kind of thing is increasingly rare in this area, but Alea Tulum is one place that still offers this oasis of an experience.",50,1240

"My husband and I found this place and had only booked one night. We ended up staying for 4 nights. It is everything we wanted. The rooms are first class - even good coffee makers (Nespresso)! Great showers, comfy beds and a balcony to watch the sun rise over the Caribbean. There is a constant fresh ocean breeze, and a wonderful  natural granite poo. The food is excellent and can be served inside or out as well as in your room. Finally, the staff are all exceptional. It has very laid back, non-pretentious feel. Oh, and I can’t fail to mention there is q beautiful  Cenote for snorkeling right next door as well as kayaks (free) to use. We paddled out to the reef right off the beach and had the best snorkeling adventure ever. I hope we can return to this place. a true gem!  Thanks",10,1240
 especially to Miguel and Eric!,30,1240
…,50,1240
"Our second time at Alea! We absolutely love it here. All the wait staff and service was excellent. Rafael was our waiter everyday and he was fantastic. Beautiful relaxing hotel. Beautiful views, great snorkeling, wonderful beach. If you want to relax in paradise without the busy this is the place to come! Hotel has everything you need, snorkeling gear, kayaks, paddle boards, bicycles, and plenty of lounging areas. Thank you to everyone here!",20,1240
If you like to take a swim and not only look at the ocean... choose another location. Very shallow waters and a lot of rocks. Impossible to swim from the beach.   Very dissapointed in gluten free options and no understanding for guests with allergens. When ordering coffee with soya milk we could not trust if they got it right or mixed with regular milk. 'No gluten free' was the words from waiter. Though hotel is promoting them selves for having good options for this.   Would never come back. Remote location. Far from all the good vibes in Tulum.  Rooms were nice and clean. Food was good.,40,1240
Pros:  The rooms are big and well laid out. You could easily spend a while here. The location is fantastic. On the beach and a 10min drive into town or to multiple cenotes. Breakfast is decent. Nice jetty and views.  Cons: The road to the hotel is a nightmare. Pot holes a foot deep. A journey which should take 1 min takes about 5 mins as you have to navigate a series of massive pot holes which will potentially damage your car. The mini bar was set to 17 degrees. What's the point? We were told that's the temperature a mini bar should be as it's not a fridge. I guess all the thousands of other hotels I've stayed at are doing it wrong then. Really poor sound proofing. Gaps in the front door meant we could hear the bar noise clearly at night. Service is so so and slow. Sometimes we,50,1240
" spoke to someone helpful other times we were ignored or fobbed off.  I'm 50:50 for recommending as the setting and rooms are lovely. However, I wouldn't stay here again and use the same money to try somewhere else. It isn't cheap after all and given the cons listed above, I'm include to try somewhere else next time.",50,1240
Really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Layla. The hotel is small and intimate with a Moroccan inspired design in the middle of town close to many good bars and restaurants. There is a great rooftop pool and bar. The staff could not have been more helpful with suggesting and booking restaurants and activities.,40,1241
"Just came back from a really enjoyable 5 night stay at Layla. Firstly it is really well located if you’re staying in Tulum town. We had a rental car so parked right outside and drove to the sights and cenotes during the day (and the beach area). The pool is an amazing spot for a swim, food or cocktails. We ate breakfast up there each day ( included in our rate. ) I tried a couple of options from the menu and both were delicious. I saw others having it in their rooms or the ground floor restaurant area. I often had the pool to myself but even when it’s busy later in the afternoon, there were always places to sit. The main thing I noticed is how helpful and friendly the staff are and how amazingly clean and well maintained the hotel is. I wasn’t a huge fan of the swinging bed in",50,1241
" our room (not all have this) but it looked amazing and i loved our bathroom. I think the rooms might feel small to guests who are used to larger hotel rooms but it didn’t bother us. My only slight negative comment is that you might hear music in the bedroom at some points, but it’s because noise echos through the hotel. (I called reception to turn it down one night which was done immediately but only because I had a very early start the next day) Overall, I really really enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend it to anyone coming to stay in Tulum town.",50,1241
…,50,1241
"We loved Layla and found the vibes perfect for our recent birthday visit.  Others have mentioned Daniel at the front desk and he's a gem.  He's warm and gracious -- and provides a level of care that is more typically of a five-star property.   But the entire staff is kind and efficient.  The roof pool is perfect and the rooms have unique features.  For the price, I don't think you'll do any better.    There are lots of vlog posts about staying at the beach vs. town.  We really liked the vibes in town and getting to the beach is super easy with a scooter or bike.    Some other nearby tips: (1) Jaguar Negro Tulum is around the corner and it the best coffee shop around, (2) Evolve Fitness is up the street and is a great spot to work out, (3) Akuma Tiger Sushi is nearby and is chic",50,1241
 AF.   Thanks again to Daniel and everyone at Layla for making my recent Bday stay so special.,50,1241
…,50,1241
"We loved our stay in Layla Tulum. Everything was perfect: the room was beautiful, breakfast was delicious and the location is superb. Just a few minutes walk and you are on the main road of Tulum centre. From there, it's very easy to take a collectivo (mini bus) to cenotes between Tulum and Playa, to Akumal beach or even straight to Playa itself. Restaurants are also close. You have to try the burgers on Layla's top floor restaurant - they are delicious!! Also bike rental places (like OlaBike) are close by and you can bike your way into the beach.  What made our stay the most perfect was Daniel in the front desk. He was always so kind and helpful. He gave the best tips and also was genuinely interested on your plans. We loved him!! Also the restaurant staff was the most",50,1241
 welcoming and kind.  I would definitely recommend this hidden gem!,50,1241

"Room was spacious and clean. The whole area offers rooms, space for RV and camping and a small beach. There is also a restaurant and workshops, so, all in all it looks more of an aggregation of activities. Only ""problems"" is that the wifi is not available in the rooms and the prices are high compared to other B&B in Yucatan. Also, breakfast was not included in the price. Most likely the reason is because it is the only structure that offers B&B service for tourists... still disappointed by the price/offered services ratio.",30,1242
"We stopped here on our way to Campeche as we were running out of gas!  We found La Gringa...both the hotel and the owner.  She is a Mexican lady who married an American marine...who has since passed away.  She was very pleasant and spoke excellent English and was very helpful.  She gave us a nice room.  The only problem was the bugs...of course not something she had control over, but the mosquitoes for some reason kept finding their way into the room by droves!  The room and bathroom were nice, clean, and well appointed and only steps away from the public beach. Nice AC.  The restaurant had good food but mediocre service.  All in all a pleasant stay.",40,1242
"The room was large but full of light and very noisy (people working early in the morning, the dogs barking...). The wifi didn't work, just in front of the reception. The bathroom was divided not by a door but by a plastic curtain. There were 2 big black bugs. Breakfast was not included. All this stuff for 70 dollars of season!!!! ",10,1242
"Incredible place. Known by both Freedom Shores and La Gringa Hotel and RV Park / Campground. It was bought and totally renovated by the current owners. Tragically Mr. Bussear passed away recently but his wife Doña Telma is carrying on and it is a really nice place to spend a few days of relaxation.  The hotel and a couple of RV sites are fully wheel chair accessible. Mr. Bussear spent most of his life in a wheel chair and it was his dream to build a place like this. Hotel rooms are spacious, clean and have AC and hot water. The food I had from the restaurant was excellent and I noticed numerous people coming in just to eat. This was in the middle of the week. Several of the RV / campsites are right on the beach. The site is fenced with 24 hour security but is quite peaceful and",40,1242
" leads out to a public beach with nice shallow, protected sea. The town is known as Isla Aguada and isn't much to talk about. Lots and lots of fisherman and a couple of other seafood restaurants. I only spent a day here so can't say much more. If you are traveling the Gulf shore in Campeche / Tabasco this is a great place to spend a few days. Hotel rooms for 2 were 900 pesos and camping was 300 pesos. Approx. $73US and $24US.",40,1242
"Over all our experience was better than expected. The rooms, grounds, beach and service was awesome. And, then came the incensent constant music. Blasting from 8am to 8pm, I didn't as an adult come to hear Disco music, boom, boom, booming in my ear all day. When i requested if they could lower it, i was told an emphatic NO! Not only on the beach but they have speakers everywhere on the property - even on the lounge swing chairs.  HEY GUYS  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU 5 STARS BUT THE MUSIC REALLY RUINED OUR VACATION.  We live in the Big City with horns, sirens, yelling, etc. We came for peace, quiet, relaxation and the sound of the waves from the Ocean. The MUSIC we can deal with on the trip at night.",30,1243
"The Roc Luxe hotel wass super nice a great experience five nights here in Tulum before heading over to Holbox for a different but just as cool experience. The food here was great and even probably some of the best food we’ve had at hotels to be honest. The staff was super helpful and sweet, returning soon.",50,1243
"We made a last minute decision to stay at Roc Lux Tulum. We felt very welcomed by the staff from point of arrival. The hotel has one of the best beach front locations with the only one as far as I could see with a pool on the beach front directly looking into the sea. Julio was a stand out member of the Roc Lux Hotel, he has connections with all the major restaurants. With great industry knowledge on which restaurant is best on certain nights. Making us reservations without any issues. Nothing was a problem for him and I’m sure if we had any issues with our stay in Tulum I am guessing he would know the guys to sort it. We are planning our trip for next year and will be staying here again. It is worth knowing there is a jungle side and beach side to the hotel.",50,1243
"Staying at Roc Luxe Tulum was one of the best decisions for our trip. It was effortless to communicate with the staff through WhatsApp chat and they made amazing recommendations for food and outings. They helped us to find activities that were even better than the ones we had planned in the first place.  We walked along the beach and thought Roc Luxe Tulum was easily the best spot out of all the hotels. The floating beds on the beach were amazing and it was the PERFECT location. It was within walking distance of most night life and food options and far enough from the beach clubs, so it wasn’t loud.  10/10 would recommend.",50,1243
"We stay at the Hotel ROC At Tulum .  Check in was nice they offer us a popsicle what a nice start ( you can choose your own flavour)  We decide to rent a bike during our salty to be able to move all over the place . Our Room was on the middle of the Jungle full of life this is Tulum .. one night a couple of raccoons visit us & we where so happy to be in touch with the wild .. Amenities good - General we love the room , the breakfast was Included daily FRESH FRUIT WITH BREAD and yogurt was perfect if you decide to upgrade you can do it they have CHILAQUILIS solo good , we get hooked with them .

"Hmmmm yes very disappointing. We ended up at this beach club a bit by accident but it seemed nice and the guy negotiated on the minimum spend for a bed for the day.  Through the day the food and drink was good but they fundamentally let themselves down when it came to the bill. They have no wine menu (or failed to produce one). We were offered two wines, chose the cheaper one but when the bill came the price for the wine was higher. $35 more. Conveniently enough to get us over the first minimum spend price we were given for the bed. We questioned this and the waiters English seemed to wain. A second guy came over who translated suggesting that we were telling a completely different story to the waiter. We suggested we would pay for the wine but the tip would now come off as",30,1243
 compensation which caused a third person to come over and the debate started again with further insinuation we weren’t telling the truth. Eventually they cut down the price of the wine claiming the tip/service charge was mandatory. They appeared to be more concerned with their own pocket than the business or repeat custom.  Google reviews had suggested we weren’t the first to experience this by far. I wish we’d followed the advice.,50,1243
…,10,1243
The best part of our 5 day stay was starting our day @6am with Matt. His energy was contagious and his presence inviting. He was creative with his workouts and adjusted as needed. It never felt like a workout it was soo much fun!!   Highly recommend classes with Matt Wise.,50,1244
"My husband and I booked to stay at Nömade after some hesitation having clocked a few recent critical trip advisor reviews. Very happy to report that we didn’t recognise the criticisms made in those reviews: perhaps these were teething problems getting back up to speed after pandemic disruption.   We stayed in a Tierra Suite and loved it: Room 201 had a shady plunge pool, perfect for cooling down (Tulum is hot in May!) It felt very private, although just off a path to the beach there was loads of foliage so it was quiet and felt secluded. The room was very spacious and beautifully decorated (and comfortable). We slept very well. The beach was a 1-2 minute walk away. No coffee machine in our room, but we were able to order pots of coffee in the morning before heading out for yoga",50,1244
" and don’t appear to have been charged for this. Wifi was quick.  Breakfast at Macondo starts at 7:30 and room service had a slightly odd black spot between about 7 and 7:30am when it closed, which could be slightly inconvenient if you want to eat before 8am yoga. However we usually waited until after our morning activities to have a leisurely breakfast. One day we need need to finish breakfast by 8 to go on an excursion and service at the restaurant was quick enough to turn us around in half an hour.   On that note, our stay had breakfast included. I thought breakfast might be a bit stingy based on previous reviews, but it was very hearty and service was friendly. As an example, one morning I had a fruit plate, bread basket, shakshuka, cafe latte, and grapefruit juice! All delicious and included in the price.   Our concierge assistants (Christian and Jorge) were extremely responsive and helped us book restaurants and an excursion. I don’t think we ever waited more than about 1 minute for a response to a WhatsApp.   I enjoyed daily yoga, and we also joined the tea ceremony, ice bath and sound therapy. For popular activities it’s worth signing up at 8pm the previous day as some are limited in space. You don’t need to sign up for yoga as there is plenty of room in the shala.   The beach had plenty of loungers in sun and shade and attentive service. There was a lot of sargassum seaweed on the beach: the hotel made valiant attempts to keep it under control although to be honest it’s a losing battle as more constantly washes in. Not the hotel’s fault and we didn’t mind at all. However if you are looking for pristine white sands and turquoise waters you may wish to try and avoid Tulum in seaweed season: it’s a problem all the way along the beach.   The shared pool at the beach isn’t huge but never got overly busy in the 6 days we were there.   The beautiful Instagram pics of the resort are truly representative of how gorgeous the place looks! All in all we had a gorgeous restorative stay.  All in all we had a wonderful restorative stay, everything we could have hoped for.",50,1244
…,10,1244
"During our 4 day stay at B Tulum, which has shared classes with Nomade, my sister and I joined Matt's yoga classes, which were one of the best we've ever had. He was extremely attentive, his voice was soothing, his instructions were clear, and he was always there to correct our postures. We loved him so much that we decided to ask him for 6:00 am Personal Training.  If you ever get a chance, please try out his yoga and workout classes. HE IS THE BEST!",50,1244
"We went to Nomade for our 6th year anniversary. We booked a deluxe tent. When we went to the tent, there was a very bad smell in the garden of the tent and also inside the tent, probably because the tent was located right next to the public toilet of the hotel. Right next to our tent, there was maintenance construction work going on!!! And the hotel didn’t really care about it and gave us that tent but the concierge said, they would cancel the planned construction the next day because we complained about it , if you are in maintenance, you don’t sell the room, because people like us are coming to relax!!! The water in the shower and the sink was not running !!! We had to call several times and go to the reception wait 45 minutes for it to be fixed. İt was fixed but no hot water",50,1244
" !!! I went to the reception and said i want to change the room, they showed us a tent which was smaller than the one we had and no sitting area in front. Then they said they would give us another room and it would be an upgrade , i checked on the internet and it was the same price as our room , which wasnt an upgrade at all. İt was a small room with a tiny shower and toilet. All this took 2.5 hours. İt wasn’t a nice way to celebrate our anniversary. Be tulum was just next door, we just checked out from nomade and stayed in beautiful Be Tulum for the rest of our holiday.",10,1244
…,50,1244
"Nomade transcends you into a mystical jungle vibe - you instantly feel far away from your daily grind which is exactly why we chose it.  This was our 2nd time there and the  place never disappoints.  The food, staff and overall ambient is exquisite.  We stayed in the master suite which was something out of a movie.  Both restaurants were amazing and quite frankly one can easily stay there and never leave and not miss a thing.  Perfect place to unplug and recharge.",50,1244
"The Nômade is an ideal hotel for a relaxing stay at the beach. Everywhere the service is top. Extremely friendly and very attentive. From the restaurants, to the beach stuff and especially the concierges do all they can to make your stay as perfect as it can be. (Eugenia and Samuel were just amazing)  The food in both restaurants is delicious and the setting is just perfect. With its eco-friendly and sustainable touch it shows perfectly how modern travelling and hospitality should be.  Don't miss the yoga classes in the morning. They are all different and extremely nice.  The beach ist beautiful, the sea too. The sunbeds are highly comfortable. For some distraction, you can visit the next door sister-hotel betulum with its cool restaurants.  We will certainly come back.",50,1244
What a great hotel. Loved the setting. Loved the atmosphere. Super service. We ate nearly every evening at the restaurant because of the food was outstanding. I would not hesitate to recommend it and definably would come back here in a heart beat.,50,1245
We stayed a couple nights at Piedra Escondida and we were really impressed. The hotel was perfectly located on a quiet beach. Martin was amazing -- he was so helpful and kind. The food was good and the rooms were clean and nice. The highlight of the stay was having turtles hatch in front of the restaurant during dinner. Might have been the best moment of the 2 week trip for our kids.,50,1245
"so much amazing food in tulum but this was one of our favorite meals.  I couldn't pass up the catch of the day, snapper and with their local sauce, and also the garlic butter sauce, it was fantastic!  such a cute atmosphere, excellent drinks and beautiful view.  Loved it!!",50,1245
"We just returned from a four night stay in Tulum.  I am so glad we decided to stay here. I was deciding between here and a few other places and basically this place had the best price to review ratio and had local food at their restaurant.  Overall, it was beautifully situated, great energy, and had a very authentic vibe with a European touch.   The room was basic, but functional.  We were on the lower floor and had a nice outdoor patio that served as our ""living room"" right on the beach. Then off that was a sandy courtyard flanked by the other small bungalows. The small complex was anchored by the common areas and restaurant looking over a beautiful sheltered cove. Some small improvements for the room would be a separate trash can (the only trash can in the room is in the",50,1245
" bathroom where used toilet paper needs to be deposited as the septic system in Tulum cannot handle the paper). So it's pretty gross and something you dont want to open unless you have to.  I would also recommend installing some hooks on the walls in the bathroom to hang towels and clothes otherwise there is no place to put clothes in the very small bathroom.     Also having a water filling station would be nice.  Small individual bottles are so bad for the environment and not sustainable.  Kills me every time I use a small bottle.  Anyways, these are just small details. The decor and vibe is very laid back and tasteful, and unpretentious which is such a relief from chaotic and touristy Tulum. I also liked getting to know the other guests at the meals every day and sharing the beach and atmosphere.  It felt a bit like a small community. Fortunately there were not so many Instagrammers which permeate Tulum.  Most well-traveled Europeans and some families with well-behaved children. My favorite thing was the restaurant. Aside from eating a few meals in the Pueblo, we ate almost every meal here. The food is made with love and features great Yucatan food with amazing sauces. Four days and I still wish we had two more days to each/try everything.  It is also well  priced for Tulum (which is not saying much).  So hats off to the Chef!   My next favorite thing was the staff. They were chill but attentive and professional.  I hope the owner pays them well and treats them well because they work very hard and so gracious. The beach was beautiful but unfortunately had seaweed and tons of waves. So we werent able to swim at all.   However there is a calmer beach right north of the rocks which you can walk to.   The hotel is located in a great area, at the beginning of the beach strip, next to some of the trendiest spots like Azulik and Sfer Ik if you are into that scene. You can walk to a dozen or so amazing boutiques and some more touristy restaurants, saving money of the crazy overpriced taxis. Overall we loved it here, and it made our trip wonderful!  If you are reading this, thank you!",50,1245

Nayeli first off was amazing, gave us a tour of the property, set us up with welcome drinks and checked on us throughout our stay regarding covid testing to get back into the US. She was friendly and helpful our entire stay!!! The restaurant… OMG everything we ate was UNREAL. Words can’t even describe how good the food was and one breakfast entree is included in your stay EACH DAY!!!  Each morning we went all the waiters were so helpful and pleasant. Every question I had they had the answers!!! The room was perfect… clean and quaint, and the most perfect patio with a hammock and chairs. It was the perfect way to wake up every morning, everytime we were in the room we left the door open because it was just so",50,1245
" beautiful. The property was perfect, the best location with multiple bars and restaurants near by, but quieter than the main strip about 5 minute drive down the road.

If what you are looking for is a quiet, relaxing beach, in the middle of Akumal barrier reef and nature preserve, then this is your place!   Tony was amazing, responsive, and provided us with great service with any request.   Our room was a spacious 2 BR facing the beach and adjacent to the local bar and restaurant Beach Bikini. The beds where great, and it has a fully equipped kitchen.   The place is very well maintained and yet, feels dated and doesn’t provide the most modern amenities.   Breakfast is varied and is a combination of Mexican and American,   Not too creative. The coffee like most of Mexico, is barely drinkable:)",40,1246

Not only the perfect location on quiet AvAkumal Beach, but staff  is friendly & helpful, take care of all our needs, food excellent.

"I am so happy I trusted the reviews and chose this hotel! If you want to stay away from the crowds in Tulum in a secluded and affordable hotel do not hesitate to book here. The service was amazing they let us check in early and delivered breakfast to our room every morning. The room was spacious and cozy. We selected a one bedroom with a kitchen and living room. Our room was ocean front on the first floor so our back door led directly to the beach. The beach is a bit rocky with some seaweed at the shoreline but it clears up once you’re two feet in. The bartenders were so friendly and offered superb service along with local tips for restaurants and activities. The drinks were surprisingly affordable at 5$ a shot.

We took a room for 2 nights. After the first night of having a drink at the beach bar followed by watching baby turtles go to the sea and mama turtles lay their eggs we were hooked! We went ahead and changed our reservation for the rest of our trip! The room was clean, we loved the laid back vibe of having a drink on the beach before going on turtle patrol for the night. We snorkeled to a little reef right off of the beach and Tony arranged for ocean and cavern diving. Much to do in the area! We will be back:-)",50,1246
"We celebrated our anniversary this year and chose Bardo for a week getaway. It's absolutely beautiful!  A couple of things we didn't like. For the amount of money we spent nothing really came with the room price, except for the water. We would have liked to use the robes without charge and it would have been nice if they provided slippers, after all the theme is all about relaxation. There was also a day we asked for our pool to be cleaned out but it took 2 hours to get someone to come. However the plunge pool is deeper than we expected very nice surprise! We also thought for the cost you should have access to mini fridge and a microwave to reheat food if you wanted. Mini fridge is packed with snacks, all for sale of course, and barely kept cool. The massages honestly were not",40,1247

Lastly we did have a minor charge issue, when we landed back home we received a message that we would be charged additionally for a vape pen housekeeping reported missing that we did not use! After speaking to management they did not follow through with the charge which was greatly appreciated, however they need a better system for those items in the room!  Overall it was a great stay. Food and drinks were excellent, hotel was close to shops, restaurants and attractions, everyone was so helpful we def would book again. It wasn't perfect but it was great experience!! We used Yes car rental and we highly recommend them! Up front pricing no nonsense and they pick you up and drop you off at the airport.",50,1247

"I cannot more strongly recommend staying at this hotel. Please, please do yourself a favor and stay here.  The rooms and overall common grounds are stunning -- they truly encompassed the tulum organic aesthetic.The restaurant is spectacular, the service at the front desk, restaurant, and pool are all around wonderful, the rooms are clean and chic (individual ""bungalows""), and they even offer morning yoga! I saw many people easily take taxis to the town for the day/their dinner reservations. We opted to use their free bikes, it was fun to peddle around and see the town. It's a dash off the beaten path from the town but an easy ride or long walk away.  I have never loved a hotel more than this one, I would rave about it to anyone that would listen.",50,1247
"This hotel is simply beautiful, with a relaxing and peaceful aesthetic. The whole staff was so warm and welcoming.   In particular, the Milum restaurant was exceptional.

Thank you to server Leo and the whole Milum team for being so kind and attentive!  Highly recommend Hotel Bardo and Milum.",50,1247
I stayed at the Bardo for five nights. We were greeted by the nicest staff at reception and the exceptional service continued through our stay.

There is no television so it’s great to switch off (but bring a tablet if you must - the WiFi is perfect with high speed connectivity).   The hotel has a great restaurant and the waiters around the pool are very attentive but not too overbearing to make you feel awkward - always a smile on their face and really great to chat with.  The pool was quiet most days (but may have been just the time we visited!) - some tasty cocktails on the menu at the bar.   The manager was kind enough to let us use the spa for a couples retreat which,50,1247
 I would throughly recommend - so relaxing and a perfect way to make a trip.,50,1247

"Best hotel I have stayed in! Embedded in a jungle setting with bohemian decor, plunge pool on the entrance to each room as a basic level with top class rooms. A lot of effort and attention to detail goes into the hotel, with each evening outdoor camp fire lit with complementing outdoor candles, makes for excellent setting for a late night time swim in there 24 hour slightly heated swimming pool. Breakfast brought to our private pool side was a highlight before the morning 9pm yoga class. (Breakfast was also top class) Melissa and José are top class hosts, nothing was a problem and they had contacts all across the city. On one of the evenings we were running late on a reservation in Rosa Negra, (1 hour) the place was queued out the door when we eventually did land but thanks to",50,1247
" Jose he kept our reservation and extended our stay! Melissa gave us excellent suggestions and organised car rental at short notice delivered to the door. I have read some of the bad reviews on hotel Bardo, they are ridiculous! Stayed in 100’s of hotels and this by far the most outstanding hotel.",10,1247
"The Mereva hotel was a super nice experience to get away from the all-inclusive resorts that my family and I tend to dislike. This time of year the seaweed was pretty bad, so we couldn’t really swim much in front of the resort. The pool and nearby cenote made up for this thankfully. The food here was very good, probably some of the best hotel food i’ve ever had. The complementary breakfasts were also a delight. While staying here, however, I think my mobile charging bank was stolen when it was charging on the wall since I forgot to bring it with me for the day.  This is my only complaint so I recommend putting all valuables in the safe. The waitstaff was super helpful and helped uplift the trip. Having positive people around you helps keep you happier.",40,1248
"Our stay was wonderful, the staff was super helpful and sweet. Food was excellent and room was clean and comfortable. It is a little tucked away but I loved that about it, we hired a car and it was no problem they came to us and was made so easy.  We definitely would go back, it was a wonderful experience.",50,1248
"This is the perfect spot for anyone looking to avoid the busy and noisy all-inclusive hotel experience. It is a small but beautiful place. One of the best things is their  chef (Javier) who prepares delicious, fresh food with an artistic presentation. Everything we ate there during our stay was of excellent quality and beautifully presented. It makes you forget you are in a small hotel!  Another highlight is the superb service.  All the staff are ready and very willing to make sure the visitors are enjoying their stay. Special mention to Francisco and Miguel for always being available to help and serve us as needed. Definitely would recommend this hotel for a relaxing vacation.",50,1248
"We stayed in the area and ate at this restaurant 3 times.  The food is flavorful, authentic and homemade.  The drinks are handcrafted and one of a kind.  The staff are friendly and were very accommodating to our larger group. We enjoyed the tacos so much we made it our last stop before the airport, so we could savor the flavors of the Yucatan.",50,1248
"We paid $365 per night for one of the beachfront rooms that are on the second floor (I think they’re better than the first floor ones because you have your own private balcony and more privacy).  The hotel is small and cute but much too expensive for where it’s located (far from more popular areas of TULUM) The ride over feels a bit sketchy and the area around the hotel is empty and feels desolate. Because of the Seaweed issue in Tulum the beach was basically unusable!! They have men throughout the day working hard at clearing the seaweed from the beach but there’s just too much to handle. You can’t go into the water unless you use the pier, and when you do there are many rocks so going without protection isn’t an option. The water is much too dusty to see anything and the waves",20,1248
" are too strong to enjoy it. Luckily they have a small lake just a few feet away from the hotel that you can go to (for $3) and snorkel / swim or Scooba dive. I suggest going later in the day when it’s not so busy.  The food at the restaurant is nice but nothing to write home about, cocktails are definitely lacking in alcohol and you should request a double shot when ordering any drink. Front desk staff were incredibly sweet and helpful but restaurant staff was a bit pushy for tips and very slow with service.  Definitely rent a car if you’re going to stay here, and forget about drinking and driving because it’s too far from any decent bars / restaurants / clubs. WIFI works well all the way to the beach, speeds of about 15mbps down and 5mbps up. In conclusion I would not recommend it for this price. A hotel like this (in this location) should be $150 a night, but because you can’t really use the beach I don’t see the point of coming here at all.",50,1248
…,50,1248
"I visited here with my mother and sister and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing service and cool atmosphere. We loved the music, food and overall vibe. Shoutout to our servers, Miguel, Jose Luis, and Francisco. Thank you for making our visit great!",50,1248
"Beautiful setting.  Lively atmosphere- great food. Our restaurant manager, Jose Luis was amazing. So friendly and on point. Would recommend coming for a lovely dinner or lunch. Great decor. Comfortable and modern. Bohemian. Great vibe.",40,1248
My significant other and I cannot say enough about this fabulous spot. Not only was the location ideal the service was impeccable. If you’re looking for A small boutique hotel that provides five star service in a most tranquil atmosphere this is the place for you. We have to give a big shout out to Francisco. He went above and beyond  to help facilitate our wonderful experience at Mereva.,50,1248
"The one constant on the playa section of Tulum and always a pleasure.  Thank you all!!  Yes, the jungle side has changed much but our feeling is Nueva Vida will outlast the Instagrammers and influencers. ",50,1249
"I wanted to like Nueva Vida so much. The price, location on the beach, charming breakfast restaurant, and parking included were all pluses for this hotel. BUT we stayed in the Ave de Paraiso Garden Studio which drastically reduced the overall quality of the trip due to noise.  This room abuts the main road along Tulum Beach and, unfortunately, is located approximately 50 meters away from two restaurants: Ilios (see pictures) and Bak. These half-nightclub, half-restaurants blare music and bass from 7:00 or 8:00 PM until 1:30 - 2:00 AM each night, making it impossible to relax on any balconies and difficult to sleep. The room's description notes ""RESTAURANTS AND BARS ACROSS STREET."" This almost makes it sound as if it is a selling point rather than the detractor that it is. A",20,1249
" clearer disclaimer noting late-night noise would have been appreciated. Beyond the noise, the room was okay and good for the price you pay which is notably lower than many other Tulum beachfront options. This makes its other rooms especially attractive options.   The beach was well kept, parking was included, and the housekeeping was prompt each day. The service was similarly good-not-great. A unique pro of this hotel is the inclusion of breakfast at the restaurant called Tamarindo across the street. This was a treat each morning. Overall, if you book this hotel, be sure to book rooms with ocean views or on the beach to escape the noise from the restaurants. Otherwise be prepared for late nights and poor sleeps.",20,1249
…,50,1249
"Proceed with caution when booking. There are two club restaurants across the street that blare music into the early hours of the morning which make it impossible to fall asleep. Even as New Yorkers used to loud night noises, this was next level: people breaking plates and yelling, techno music that shakes the very walls. It’s very hard to enjoy the beautiful beach, solid breakfast, and well-situated hotel when you’ve been up all night listening to blaring music.   Pretty disappointing and just wanted to get home so we can actually get some sleep.",20,1249
"I would absolutely return on a future trip. The rooms are separated by a labyrinth of sand paths through the trees--almost gives it a summer camp vibe. Also little beach cats running around!! We slept every night with the doors wide open and the mosquito net to hear the ocean. You can see the ocean right from your room and balcony and hammock with great views of the sunrise.   There's two really loud restaurants across the street, but we were close enough to the ocean to not really hear them. The hotel is in a really good location, walking distance to incredible restaurants. We rented a car and there is a free parking space for you. Breakfast across the street is free and yummy. Be sure to bring cash for a tip.   They lay out beds under shady structures during the day on the",50,1249
" beach. Thankfully, it's not directly next to any of the clubs that blast loud music. Perfect tranquil beach days. Tamarindos will bring food/drinks to you for a fee or you can walk to the surrounding beach clubs.   My ONLY complaints are that the water jug is tiny and I would run out of water every day and that I would have loved to drink coffee on the balcony.",50,1249
…,50,1249
"We used to love this resort thanks to its beautiful views, serene ocean and romantic feel. This was our fifth visit over the last 10 years - sadly the last one... The neighborhood has changed so much... there are two noisy clubs nearby and the property hasn't invested money into maintenance. Rooms are the same as they were 10 years ago and the beach is not maintained any more. Most guests seem to be party-goers who use the resort to sleep, not for the beach. The property managers Ricardo are great (thank you!), but unfortunately this noise place is not for us any more.",10,1249
"Nueva Vida is a beautiful place to stay, with comfortable beds, cosy bungalows and a lovely beachfront, and many restaurants right outside the property. The included breakfast at the restaurant across the street was wonderful, organic farm fresh food, and all the staff here are super friendly. The little sand trails to the rooms give it a very warm atmosphere.  There’s pretty loud music at the restaurant across the street in the evenings, which you can hear in the rooms closer to the road. If you want a quiet room at night you’d be wise to book a room near the beach instead.  We got amazing massages at the open air beach spa just a few minutes walk away, at BT Tulum Hotel. All in all, a real paradise as far as I’m concerned. Would definitely like to return here!",30,1249
"So there’s some good things and bad as with all trips away but I feel the hotel over sold and under delivered.   Good points - large rooms, jacuzzi bath on balcony, free parking, 24/7 security, restaurant opening hours are longer than usual so no restrictions. Free bicycles to take out for the day. Snack bar open from 12 onwards. Not over crowded as it’s a small hotel.  Bad points - rooms are not like those pictured in the ads, the hotel needs a renovation as it’s tatty around the edges and not luxury. The one restaurant on site choices are limited with the majority being a set menu each night, (Mexican night, Asian food night, etc)   The wifi is not included and the only free wifi is in the main entrance lobby they wanted $80 for a few days which is extortionate, we added a",30,1250
" wifi bolt on with our provider.  The aircon in our room was broken the whole time we were there meaning we struggled to sleep as the room got up to 26 degrees, we went to reception on a number of occasions to ask for this to be looked into however each time someone came they proclaimed it was working despite the fact our room never dropped below 24 degrees.  The coffee/tea making facilities consisted of a filter coffee machine and one creamer sachet which was not replaced everyday so we went to the local 7/11 store to buy milk and extra items.  The only bar around the pool is a swim up bar which means you have to go around the pool and lean over the side to place an order if your not in the pool.  The snack bar although open from 12 doesn’t serve any drinks including soft drinks with your meal these have to be collected or ordered separately.",50,1250
…,10,1250
"This was my first experience with an all inclusive resort and now that I've been so spoiled by the Kore I don't know how I'm ever going to stay in a regular hotel again.  The best thing by far was the staff.  They were so sweet and polite and helpful.  Anything we asked for they brought and with a smile on their face, like hot sauce for the table, drink after drink after drink, dish after dish of food.  They even let us practice our Spanish with them.  Great people for sure.  My room was clean, pillows and bed incredibly soft and comfortable. The food was delicious and they were soooo generous with it.  Even AFTER we checked out, they gave us a voucher to eat lunch while we waited for our airport shuttle.  I mean come on!  That's hospitality!",50,1250
"We arrived on Thursday, there was a notice under our hotel door the power would be out but would return 1 PM on Friday. 1 PM Friday came and went and there was no air-conditioning no power no Wi-Fi no nothing. I went down to the front desk and asked what was going on nobody had any answers. Sunday morning the air conditioner finally went back on and we were leaving on Monday.",10,1250
My first time in tulum with my best friend and it was amazing. The service was so good. Javier made us the best drinks. Can’t wait to come back soon. Our room was beautiful. The sushi on Monday was sooo good.,50,1250
"This hotel was booked for for a January 2022 trip, however due to the rise of COVID cases in December/January due to Omnicron, we decided to cancel. I canceled within the timeframe of the hotels posted timeframe. We have been given the run around, transferred to accounting multiple times, was told to speak with Flavio Gonzales or Victor, no one ever answers the phone. We have spoken with Noria in reservations multiple times verbally and via email to no avail. Its May and there is still no refund.",40,1250
"A 2 hour drive to get their from Cancun but worth it.  This is a smaller resort, adults only, and was all inclusive.  Very good food and drinks.  The staff was supper friendly especially Noemi and Jesus. There is no beach access on site but there is one close by.  the Wifi was only real issue but we could go to the lobby to access.",10,1250
This was a great place to spend a well needed holiday after so much going on in our lives and after the difficulties of covid The transfer was about 2 hours from Cancun and was delayed 40 minutes but the driver was friendly  Our welcome was nice and the staff were always helpful,50,1250
"Me and a friend just returned from a 4 nights, 5 days stay at this resort. To say that our stay was disappointing is to an understatement! Let me start by saying that I am a well-traveled individual and had chosen to stay at Kore based on reviews/photos posted. The resort is advertised as a ""4-star"" resort, after my stay I would give it 2.5 stars at best! Below is a list of unsatisfactory incidents that happened. - carts passing by with loud noise throughout the late evening into the morning - workers banging on the door next to my room, causing me and my guest to wake up in panics - Dirty room condition (pictures to prove the door knobs, shower door, in room jacuzzi, windows etc) - Poor food quality and room service response (rude after we ordered wine, questioning ""didn't you",10,1250
"We had a phenomenal experience at Hotelito Azul- from the moment we walked in we were greeted with the utmost welcoming staff, that made you feel special and appreciated. The attention to detail and staff were amazing. They went above and beyond to assure we were well taken care of. A special thank you to Pedro the hotel manager. Overall an excellent experience and would definitely return and would recommend to anyone looking for a lush experience in Tulum- I highly recommend this his property!!! Enjoy!!",50,1251
I am SO excited my Dad and I stumbled upon this spot on our beach walk one morning. We stopped by for some drinks and ended up staying all day on the beautiful rooftop! Eleazar and his staff are amazing and so accommodating. I will definitely be going back as many times as I can to catch some beautiful sunsets and show this place off to visiting friends ,50,1251
"The location, the decor, and the staff were amazing! They made our stay in Tulum wonderful! They had bicycles and scooters you could rent to explore Tulum. The concierge service was very knowledgeable of the local area and was able to get us reservations to some fantastic restaurants/night life venues!  The rooftop bar has the best view you can get in Tulum! Thank you guys for an amazing time in Tulum! We will be back ",50,1251
Great hotel… great food… awesome roof top bar… fabulous staff.  Location is good nas close to everything via cab or just a pleasant walk.  The music is amazing … I Shazam’d so many songs and created an off the charts playlist that will forever remind me of the great time in Tulum and Hotelito Azul.,50,1251
A lovely hotel with friendly staff! Thank you to Liz and Edbar for being so helpful. Rooms are excellent and spacious and the views from the hotel rooftop bar are sensational!  This hotel is at the heart of the hotel zone and restaurants are walking distance on the beach or through the main road,50,1251
"We went to this hotel in May (2021) and were utterly disappointed by the accommodations, staff, and a closed off beach! Prior to our arrival, we called the hotel to make sure that we have beach access and that our room is in a quiet location, which we were assured of that it would be. Once we got there, we found our room next to loud construction, the door was broken, and beach was closed to due bad seaweed! Also, the pool was the size of a tub! Their pictures are photoshopped and they are completely misrepresenting their hotel!  We wanted to still give it a chance and switch rooms, only to find ourselves without a working A/C and bugs all over the bed!  This place is gross and the staff is very rude and hard to get a hold of because they don't have phones! DO NOT GO HERE!",10,1251
"My boyfriend and I went for his 30th birthday and during booking our travels we were sooo unsure of which hotel to choose, but we’re so so happy we went with Hotelito Azul. We had the most incredible time! The staff is beyond friendly and helpful and the hotel was beautiful - online pictures didn’t do it justice. We’ll definitely be back!",50,1251
Visited Olivia Organic Market and had delicious and fresh coconut water! The owner is very friendly and gave my girlfriends and I a tour of hotelito  Azul. Looked absolutely amazing with stunning views of the beach. Looking forward to staying with them the next time I’m in Mexico!,50,1251
Tulum is a great place to visit and this hotel made our stay exceptional. Staffs are super friendly and made themselves available at all time. They had great suggestions for things to do in the area and restaurants to try. John and Cindy were very professional managers for hotel and food/beverages.,50,1251
"Beautiful hotel (not 5 stars) with good service, a very tough value proposition.  Much of the reason for the 3-star review is that Tulum is a polluted noisy faux eco sham that would bring the score down for any hotel we may have stayed in.  This is one of the nicer hotels we saw on the Tulum beach strip, but by NO means a 5-star hotel by any definition of the industry standards.   The service is very good, with superstar performance by Aurelio and Cornelio on the rooftop pool/bar area and great support from the concierge desk.  However, the prices are extremely high and I literally woke up angry a couple of nights feeling taken advantage of with full New York/London/LA prices for food and beverage.   Inconsistent with any other Mexico resort area, e.g., $7.50 US for a Croissant",30,1251
"Casa Malca is an incredibly unique stay in Tulum. We have been to Tulum several times. We've stayed at hotels on the beach, hotels in town, AirBnBs, etc. But Casa Malca was by far our favorite stay. The entire staff was incredibly welcoming, helpful and attentive. The property was beautiful. The townhouse we stayed in was amazing. It was incredibly spacious, modern and private. Extra bonus was a private rooftop deck to watch the sunset. The food was incredible across the restaurants and the beach / pool services was impeccable. Casa Malca is a very UNIQUE stay - expect to pay for an incredibly experience. Pro tip - you might get a discount if you go during spring/summer when the seaweed is high. But the staff works daily on removal so you get the benefit but don't have the",50,1252

"Everything was magical: The jungle, the sand, the food, the beverages, the art, the rooms... The staff was very helpful and friendly The room was spacious and having a patio in the garden / jungle was very entertaining for the kiddos Will go back in a heartbeat",50,1252
"Nice place, recomand 100%. Personal are so friendly and kind. Really recomand this place. I was in all Tulum and this place is the only one with good stuff and quality food! Also the best sushi evere ! Love casa Malca!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",30,1252
"Casa Malca definitely exceeded my expectations.  When searching for hotels in Tulum it is difficult to decipher with all the information available.  They offer LOTS of great photo spots throughout the complex, as well as a great view at the beach.  Even considering it was the beginning of seaweed season, they had people on the beach DAILY cleaning up the beaches so that we could enjoy the views all day long.  The concierge was phenomenal, and if you don't already have WhatsApp, I recommend you download it so that you can communicate easily with them.   We rented a car to get around in Tulum, which I feel was the best choice we could have made.  It costed me $500, but when you calculate the per person fees to and from resorts, as well as the cab fees and ability to travel",20,1252

"Very noisy hotel. Not relaxing at all. Seems that there’s no place to find any tranquility. Music is coming from all directions, people are screaming, cars honking. It’s too close to the road and not well secluded. Not a great experience.",10,1253
My wife and I were walking on the beach and stopped here to eat.  We have to say Janet the manager here made our experience amazing. She made us feel like long life friends. We had an amazing views of the water. The coffee was delicious. I ordered the avocado toast with eggs on top. Something so simple tasted amazing. We took our time and really enjoyed our entire experience. Highly recommend. ,50,1253
"Wonderful experience at this hotel! I stayed here with my fiancé for the past 6 days and I can’t say enough good things. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating on every level- from helping to get Taxis, to food recommendations and more. Our room was beautiful with a view straight to the ocean and very clean! The staff works hard to keep the beach meticulous and it shows. Breakfast was included each day with our stay which was also a great addition. This was our first time to Mexico and Tulum and I definitely already would return to stay at this hotel. 10/10!!",50,1253
My friends and I came here for a bachelorette party. We loved it! It’s so beautiful. Lily the manager made sure our group had the best time. I would highly recommended it. Such a great experience. The rooms are magical. The whole entire hotel has the best vibes and so many places for pictures. 10/10. Can’t wait to come back.,50,1253
We celebrated our friends bachelorette party here and it was amazing! Everything was beautiful and the service was awesome. Very friendly staff. Definitely recommend. Rooms are right on the beach with a gorgeous view.,50,1253
"I would recommend Coco limited to any friends or family looking for a place to stay in Tulum. We had a beautiful room with views of the pool, beach and tropical brush. The staff created an exceptional experience for us by providing the most amazing service! They were quick to bring towels and ice to our room. They work very hard keeping the sand clean in front of the beach as well as cleaning the pathways around the hotel constantly. The breakfast every morning on the beach was fantastic (pictures), the food, the service especially, everything was just great! We will be back!",50,1253
"My husband and I stayed here for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon and it was amazing! The staff and the service was exceptional, everyone was so friendly and always willing to help! Breakfast was included in our stay, portion sizes were generous and plenty of options to choose from! We loved how close we were to the beach and the small intimate feel of the place. There was no tv in the room, not a downfall for us but just as an fyi, and the wifi was actually really good, for those that need to check in with work or simply wanna post to IG! The go mart is a short walk away if you want to grab snacks, beer or even water for your room but the hotel does not provide mini fridges in the rooms to keep things cold. You can grab a spot on the beach under a palapa but go fairly early",40,1253
" as it’s first come first serve and anyone can grab one, not just hotel guests. The service on the beach was outstanding, no need to carry cash, you can charge food and drinks to your room, but prices are more comparable to North American pricing and whether you order a virgin cocktail or not, it’s still the same price. Lots of good options nearby for dinner, but very touristy therefore you’re paying anywhere between 80-200 USD for dinner, for two. The rooms lack closet space to hang and/or fold your clothes so unfortunately my suitcase stayed on the floor  open the entire time, I’d recommend bringing a steamer! The rooms also don’t have a lot of hooks to hang your wet towels and bathing suits so you have to get creative. Overall it’s a really great place and I’d definitely go back, i think there’s just a few small tweaks that can make it even better!",40,1253

"Had a lovely dinner by myself here. Gustavo and Federico were very attentive and friendly while I hung out on the beach with my book! I had the corn, enchiladas and a dessert. I love that there’s a coupon that can be used between the different coco hotels and just a short walk down the beach",10,1253
"New resort between Tulum and Riviera Maya. The lobby was beautiful with a great view of the ocean, but that was about the only positive of this place. The service was well below what you expect in Mexico. Room was cleaned, but no towels were provided; had to call 3 times and almost 2 hours later before receiving any. Left the empty tissue box out in the open, only to come back after the room was serviced to find the box sitting in the same spot, empty.  Nice touch having a Nespresso machine in the room, but never had coffee for it. Called several times throughout the trip and only once did someone show up, with 4 decaf pods and no creamers; needless to say, we could never use it. Fridge was stocked with bottled waters, but no bottle opener to open them, called but never got one.",20,1254
" No hand held sprayer in the shower which is a very poor design, and although the rooms looked nice, the layout in general wasn't the most functional. The hallways and stairs might as well be a slip and slide, as we watched multiple people fall.  I would normally think it was the tequila that made them fall, but that couldn't have been it, since the drinks were completely watered down.  Food was ok, but I guess that is expected from all-inclusive.  Overall, left a lot to be desired.  We travel to Mexico multiple times per year and always go back for the service, as that typically trumps anything else.  In this case, the service was the worst part, with everything else equally as bad.  With so many beautiful resorts fighting for your business, there would be no reason to head back here.",30,1254

"New resort.  Food in restaurants and room service was good. Service at restaurants and pool was very slow. The beach is filled with seaweed other than a small area. Adding a nature trail, hammocks and a quiet area would be nice. The rooms open up to pool areas. The pool area by my room was loud. Not terrible and some nice things. If you are a pool person, this resort could be for you. If you like the beach and being in nature, likely best to choose somewhere else.",50,1254

"If in the mood for a chillaxing luxurious vacation, Hilton Tulum is for you. The attentive service everywhere was impeccable: greeters, front desk,  concierge, restaurants,  pool waitstaff, shuttle. It felt like our own little slice of paradise. The rooms are up to  Hilton’s high standards. I will be returning.  Hilton Tulum is a 1hr 15min ride from Cancun airport. I booked Tropical Elite Travel for the drive. I was VERY pleased with the ease of the booking and pickup at the airport. The vehicle was very clean.  We spent the first day at the pool. The guac and chips and margaritas immediately had us forget the long travel day. The pool staff bent over backwards to serve us graciously.  We did the 1/2 Day trip to the Tulum Ruins and a Mayan village with an underground river swim.",50,1254
" Cenote. Our guide was Justina and she was top-notch. Incredibly knowledgable, organized, and friendly. We were pleased.   We did a 1/2 Day trip on a catamaran with a swim/snorkel option. The crew was fabulous. The trip was top-notch.  We booked both our day trips through the Tropical Elite representative located off the main lobby in the Hilton. He was very helpful.  I will not advise on two things other guests often look for. I can’t tell you about the beach (I’m a pool dweller where the drinks/food are served endlessly). I can’t advise you on the nightlife (I pack my days and go to bed early). Therefore, this review does not include those two items that I did not partake in.  I stayed in room 2209. The view was magnificent, and I spent A LOT of time on my balcony. The walk from the main building with the restaurants to my room was maybe 120 meters. If you prefer a longer walk, select a higher building #. If you prefer a shorter walk, hop on the lobby shuttle to be dropped right at your building.   There are seven pools to choose from. We spent time at 4 of them and loved each one. There is a bar adjacent to each pool. I’ve decided after this trip I prefer the pool adjacent bar over the swim up bar.   This trip was an “end of college term” getaway with just my son and me. It couldn’t have been a more perfect trip. I will be back soon.  The concierge, Alfredo, is the man to make friends with on the first day. He is a gem. He paved the way for an amazing stay.  Jhonatan, Gucci, and William were amazing activities staff. They were fun, sociable, and always showed up when we needed a fun game.  I’d recommend this resort to families, couples, ladies getaway trips, family reunions, weddings, anniversary celebrations, and celebrations in general. It’s beautiful place where great memories can be made.",50,1254

"Came to this resort because it recently opened and was a bit of challenge to find it considering there was no signage with their name  Hilton Tulum at the front entrance?  Had to ask the guard at the gate if this was the right place and it was. Lol  After booking this resort online, I called the front desk and also emailed the resort about making advance reservations for dinner at the specialty restaurants.  Although it’s all inclusive, many of the restaurants do book up fast and you’ll be out of luck if you don’t make reservations in advance.  The response was you do not need reservations as they are a la carte.  Another downside was this resort check in time is much later at 4pm instead of the norm which is 3pm.  The drive from Cancun airport to the resort is about 1.5hrs.   ",10,1254
We stayed at Cabanas Tulum for my friends 40th birthday. The service was impeccable from check in to check out. We had couples massages. One of the best massages I have had in some time. The breakfast each day was delicious and free. The hotel is in the perfect location right on the beach. We stayed in the ocean view room with a rooftop deck. The room was beautiful and we used the hot tub quite a bit. We would definitely return.,50,1255
My friends and I had a wonderful experience here! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect and the beach is quiet with lot of places to relax. We came to celebrate my birthday and the staff was so sweet with birthday cake at breakfast and champagne and decorations in our room after massages. The spa is amazing as well and super easy to book. The food at both restaurants was excellent and you get a lot ( 2 entrées and drink) I can not say enough good thing about this hotel.  Yoga was great as well perfect way to start the day. I will definitely b staying here again my next time in Mexico,50,1255
"I really enjoyed my stay at Cabanas Tulum. The room was very cute and comfortable. Had a direct path to the beach, which was only a few steps away.  The food was great.  We also enjoyed some spa treatments as well as the hydrotherapy.  The staff was absolutely amazing, so friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself is in a great spot. Very easy to get around and check out the area.",50,1255
"My wife and I spent the last 4 days of our honeymoon here and could not be happier with the experience we had at Cabanas. From the time we arrived until when we left, all of the staff were extremely friendly, attentive and helpful. We stayed in a beachfront room with plunge pool, which had an incredible view of the beach and was a short walk from all of the beach day beds under the palm trees. Cannot say enough about the front desk service. The ladies were incredibly quick to respond (through Whats App or face to face) to make reservations for taxis and restaurants on our behalf and provided excellent recommendations of sites to visit and places in town to eat. The taxi's always arrived early including the day we left to get to the airport. After reading other comments about",50,1255
" noise, etc. I was apprehensive to book, but can say we did not share that experience whatsoever. If anything you can hear faint music in the distance during the day (from the beach not the room), but it wasn't offensive. The only negative to mention would be around prices, but that is the trend all along the beach in Tulum compared to anywhere else. It wasn't too outrageous, but noticeably higher everywhere. Have to give props to the bartenders here. They made some amazing drinks and provided some cool history behind the Mezcal, tequila, etc. they serve. Food on site is great, staff is great, location is great. Can only recommend.",50,1255

"We were searching for a place that was close to places but also on the quiet, relaxing and subdued side...this place hit the mark.  We rented a beach front roof top and loved our stay.  You can go from room to beach or pool in literally seconds. The Service is TOP NOTCH. We would and are coming back.",50,1255
"We went to Tulum for the first time and stayed in Cabanas Tulum Beach Hotel & Spa. The stay there was everything we had dreamed of and even more! The hotel, the location, the restaurants, yoga classes and very nice&friendly personnel. To wake up with the beach front view and sounds of the waves then take a few steps for the morning swim in the sea or just sit down in a beach bed to watch the sun go up was just amazing. The breakfast was really high class and delicious healthy food. I already miss my every morning acai bowls at Fresco's the hotels restaurant! We also enjoyed the other hotel restaurant Ziggy's on the beach very much. I loved the morning yoga classes what a great way to start every day.",50,1255
"We went to Tulum with our family and stayed at the vanilla loft. It is a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 more beds in the attic. There are 2 bathrooms, a great private hot tub and a beautiful waterway entrance with stepping stones. The rooms have air conditioning and are very well maintained. It is very comfortable and is perfect for a family.  It is also in a great location, on the beach and walking distance to several of the best restaurants and clubs in Tulum. You can access their beach for free as a guest of the hotel. Most beach areas in Tulum are part of different hotels/restaurants, so you usually need to pay a cover charge or be a guest of the property to access it.  They have a great Spa as well. You can access the steam, sauna, a hot tub and a cold tub for free. They just",50,1255

"We loved our stay at the Coco Tulum hotel! Staff was very accommodating to us. We both enjoyed our massages at the spa, which were also at an excellent price point. Such a great location and beautiful rooms! Very relaxing.",50,1256
"My partner and I recently visited Tulum but booked an airbnb in the jungle, aprox 20 min from the beach. On our first day in Tulum we happened upon the Coco Beach club. We loved the vibe, service, location, friendly staff, drinks and food so much that we booked a night in a garden villa, we loved that experience so much that we booked a 2nd night.  The room was perfect, cozy, steps from the beach and the incredible sunrises. The ac worked amazing and the bed provided both of us restful sleeps. There is no tv but the wifi is sufficient to watch Netflix etc. should you want to. It was also my partner's birthday and i arranged with the front desk to have flowers for our arrival, they not only assisted with choosing and picking up a beautiful arrangement but had it waiting on time,",50,1256
" the room smelled like a tropical drink! The outdoor space was lovely, 2 big chairs and a hammock, a perfect spot for a glass of wine and a nap after a day on the beach.   Initially I was hesitant about the shared bathroom but found it was charming with its conch shell faucets and bamboo showers, it was always clean and restocked.  The location cant be beat, close to great dining, bars, convenience stores for alcohol, sunscreen, and snacks, and a private parking lot across the street. The room rate that we had also included breakfast, it was delicious but also saved us $40 cad daily.  While we initially booked the hotel because of the location and great beach club, we stayed because of the staff;  From the attentive beach club staff to the front desk team, all were like friends by the time we left.  One staff member offered to buy us a soft drink with his own money from the staff area when we found out that the hotel didnt have a vending machine. We were always greeted with a genuine smile, used our names, and always asked what they could do to make our stay even more enjoyable. We have booked a return trip for March 2022 and can't wait to experience this little slice of paradise for a week!",50,1256

Our first visit to Mexico was great! The staff at Coco Tulum were so friendly and helpful and our accommodations were fabulous. Beautiful! The pizza at the nearby restaurant was phenomenal and we all recommend the pinã colada!,50,1256
We had the best stay at Coco Tulum! Service was incredible. Walking distance to the best dance clubs and restaurants! Food was great! Walking distance to the beach! Room was clean and so was bathrooms. We will definitely be coming back!,50,1256

"Coco Tulum is so beautiful! Mario helped us and he is an amazing soul! He exceeded our expectations and provided 10/10 customers service. We never had this type of friendly service anywhere, but here!   Food was delicious 10/10 Experience 10/10 Customer service 10/10 Ambiance 10/10  He made sure our group was taken care of. Highly recommend coming here and asking for Mario.",50,1256
"We stayed in T3, the honeymoon suite, which was rustically beautiful, definitely the answer to boring samey more corporate hotels that you get sick of. The room had real personality, got lots of fresh air, had a private balcony that felt quite private, and was gorgeous with is natural shower and conch shell sink. It was kept very clean, the products were nice, and there were always plenty of them. I found the king size bed and pillows very comfortable. The air conditioner worked perfectly and kept the room very cold.  It had a nice speaker if you want to play your own music to drown out the other clubs.  There were a few things missing that could have taken it to the next level: an ice bucket, mini fridge, a coffee maker so you don't have to get up to go get coffee,  and an",50,1256
" extra blanket, for sitting outside on the balcony when it's cool in the evening. We stopped rinsing our feet, even though there's a little bowl outside your room, because the floor is so slick when wet, I totally slipped once. Birds start calling early each morning, and because it is a thatched roof, it sounds like they are right in there with you. There was a cute little woodpecker who came up to our window and pecked most mornings. It really didn't bother me, but I think for someone who wakes easily, after the club music all night, it could be an issue.   You can get an ice bucket from the beach club and return it the next day, but it's silly not to have one available in the room to chill your water, juice, or champagne. This would be such a simple upgrade to have cold water. They provide beach towels and refresh them each day, but only once did we get actual beach-length towels; the rest of the time they were regular towels and too short to reach the length of the beach chairs. One day their was an issue with the water pressure (only drips) and there wasn't hot water. There was also a terrible sewer smell that I was afraid would be there every day, although there was no obvious issue with the toilet, and we didn't flush any toilet paper, per the policy. Luckily these issues were immediately fixed. But then the morning we left there was no hot water again. Keep in mind it's a natural shower, so there can never be great water pressure.  The other thing is there is supposedly a zen zone and a beach club zone, which is kind of a joke, and wasn't representative of what I thought I had booked. The zen zone had 6 chairs one time, but usually only had 4 and some hammocks, no exaggeration. When I asked about more, they said they would check with maintenance and maybe some chairs were being repaired, but there were never more any day. Now maybe there isn't beach club service there, but you could walk right to the bar, it's very close, but it would have been nice to try the zen zone, which was full every day by 9:00, but there are no chairs. It's clear business is completely steered to the beach club, which is fine as long as you don't mind the music, which is chill.  Beach and beach club: There are no beach umbrellas at either the zen zone or the beach club. There is a shaded overhang that was full by 10 all days except one, so we got up early.  They are very particular about keeping the chairs in their spots and you can't scoot your chair in or out of the sun. There are actually only a few fully shaded spots and most here are partial shade, which is fine with me. It can be quite loud by the speakers but otherwise was fine.  The service at the beach club is great though, and we loved the fresh and excellent food and cocktails. A small breakfast menu was included in our stay, and if you get bored you can pay to upgrade for more choices, but everything was delicious and the coffee was good.  We are dinner at the restaurant a few times and it was good too.  Service at the restaurant and room service was quick and efficient.  Lunch at the beach club was my favorite.the pasta and pizza was pretty good. I recommend downloading what's app and looking up how to make it your default messenger app ahead of time, which you have to follow a link to do, at least we couldn't just change the settings on our phone to allow this. The wifi was strong at the hotel.   Surrounding area and walking: We've previously started on the outskirts of Tulum, at the edge of Playa del Carmen, and at Rivera Maya had a great time.  This hotel however is pretty much in the middle of the main drag, with no space between resorts, they are all cramed together, and it is a big party zone, with bars and clubs everywhere. There is constant music all day and all night.  I was like, why did we drive an hour and forty-five minutes from Cancun to be right in the middle of a party zone again?!  Coco Tulum never played any loud obnoxious music, it's all chill lounge music/sushi restaurant music, with one night what it sounded like a band right there, so loud it sounded like they set up in our bathroom, but they were done by 10, so that was fine for one night. That being said, we stayed there a week, and all nights except one there was some type of club music mostly throughout the night. But there are just so many clubs, there's not even really a single offender, there are multiple, and oftentimes people screaming and carrying on in the street, but not really at this hotel. So if you are a light sleeper, I would just in general stay away from this zone in Tulum. It's also located on a strip of road with no shoulder. And there is a place with a paved shoulder about a mile or so out. Outside of Coco Tulum though, there's actually a muddy, dirty, inconsistent dirt strip with plants and rocks, trash, sometimes with a little more room on one side than the other, but it's not a shoulder or even a consistent dirt strip.  You'll probably get splashed by a cyclist, so wear crappy clothes if you are ever in it, because the dirt strip is shared by pedestrians because there is literally no infrastructure, it stinks and the road itself isn't even paved or doesn't have a middle line or lines on the outside. We walked to two very close places to eat, but in retrospect, probably wouldn't do it again.",50,1256
"Stayed in #2 and enjoyed open windows and ocean breeze day and night. Rooms are super cool with stone walls and thatched roof. Safe and low key vibe with good food, but not cheap for Mexico … mind you you are on the ocean with super service and cleanliness. The private cove beach allows for nice shallow swimming if your OK with some seaweeds which are unavoidable right now on most of the Mexican east coast. No regrets and would recommend it for primarily couples even though there were some families there.",40,1257
"We would especially like to say a massive thank you to Leyver & Amilcar, who helped make our holiday at Diamante K such an enjoyable experience. They were both very personable, patient & kind in helping us with dining arrangements & activities. They are a huge asset to Diamante K. We really enjoyed our stay. The resort is quite idyllic in its setting & location & very close to nature, which is what we wanted. No need for an alarm clock when you have green woodpeckers outside your door. Each day we enjoyed our walk along the main beach next door to watch the pelicans & frigate birds. At night we liked to sit up high in the Magic Garden where you could almost touch the stars &, listen to the ocean. We needed lots of rest & relaxation & we found this in abundance at Diamante K.",50,1257
"I stayed at Diamanté K with my two friends and then solo. The setting was so true to itself - we felt immediately embedded into an authentic Tulum beach community. The staff was extremely kind and accommodating. I needed to have early check in and check outs, and they went out of their way to support all of my asks. As a solo female traveler, I felt totally safe here. The experience at diamanté K is truly unique and real, and could not recommend it more.",50,1257
"If you want to be right by the beach, sleep with the sounds of the waves and the birds, this is your place! This is not a usual hotel comfort but it's a one of a kind experience with tasty food and a beautiful and picturesque environment. It's very close to the historic part and the popular downtown area. You can either walk or rent a bike. The staff was very nice and helpful, and they give good recommendations for your stay. ",50,1257
My husband and I stayed here for three days for our anniversary. We had such an amazing time. The bungalows are so cute and comfortable and the veiw is incredable. I won't lie I was scared reading about bugs and being hot but none of that was even a thing. With the ocean breeze and fans above the bed we were not hot at all and I didn't see a single bug inside the bungalow.  The front desk people are so helpful and nice. We rented a scooter through them which was such a good idea because the taxis are very expensive and we were able to explore Tulum.  We ate at the restaurant quite a bit also everything we ate was delicious and I just love the ambiance of the place especially at night. Everyone who worked in the restaurant were also so nice.

"Diamante K has an incredible location - beautiful private beach and we loved being peacefully away from the main drag, however still close enough to enjoy the restaurants, bars and shops in the evenings.   Rooms are 'rustic'. We really enjoyed the fact that they are constructed ecologically and located right on the beach in a national park... however this does mean poor lighting, weak water pressure and sometimes elements from the thatched roof falling over the bathroom or suitcases. The beds were incredibly comfortable! Loved waking up to the sounds of the birds and the waves.   The restaurant overlooks the water from a fantastic location. Service can be very slow, however the food is decent and priced fairly for Tulum!  Staff were very friendly, accommodating and provided us",50,1257

Great hostel close to Tulum downtown. Has a nice coworker coworking space and chill area downstairs for getting stuff done and downtime as well as an area that’s buzzing and has live music if you’re feeling like partying.

Don’t book external tours through them though as they never actually booked me on one, after I paid the deposit, and I spent over an hour waiting around for a tour. I tried to contact the front desk but no one answers the phone. It was a bit of a mess and created a big “downer” on my Trip.

When we asked for new pool towels because no one changed ours the staff made us go to the room and bring the old ones (WTF) The stay was bad and we wouldn’t recommend this place!",10,1258

If you are the type who suffers with mosquitoes, do yourself a favour and book Dune because you’ll be really happy.

They also have a rooftop pool and restaurant. The hotel offers you a great hospitality and excellent service. Would love to visit again!,50,1260
This was the second time I stayed at the aloft tulum (first time was with family and now with a friend) and I don’t regret it at all!  Ever since we crossed the door of the hotel we were treated super well by the people on the front desk and everyone in general.  I can say my fav part of the hotel is the rooftop. My friend and I would go there everyday and just chill and enjoy the view while we recharged energy at the end of the day. I also really liked that they had a DJ on the weekend.  The hotel also had free transport service to take you to Mia beach club and Paradise beach club which is quite nice if you don’t want to drive there or take expensive cabs. I think they also have bikes you can borrow but I personally didn’t use them.  It’s also nice to have so many restaurants,50,1260

They also have bikes to rent, and we had so much fun exploring Tulum with the bikes, is the best way.  We had a lovely stayed and I recommended for sure!!

"I had a great 5 night stay in April.  The breakfast and rooftop poolside restaurant were both good.  I opted in for a resort fee (you can elect to start any night of your stay) and it included food and beverage credits, daily shuttle to 2 drop offs along the beach, one very close to the archaelogical zone, and some other nice perks.  I also made use of the gym, rooftop pool, and free bike rentals, all of which were great.  The staff was excellent overall, particularly Enrique at the front desk and Filiberto, my breakfast server.  When I couldn't use the beach shuttle, taxi to the beach scene cost between $15 and $25 USD and was safe and easy.  Would not recommend walking or biking to/from the beach at night as the road is dark. Would definitely recommend staying at Aloft if",40,1260

Sandoval in the cabana area was great. Gabby at the salon was wonderful. Everyone there goes out of their way to provide a great experience.

" were a group of Americans who did NOT want American food while there; we wanted authentic Mexican food and what we got wasn't great. The resort had a few Mexican fiesta nights that were very good. The food at Portofino was excellent. It was just strange for the Italian food to be better than the Mexican food while in Mexico. The food at El Patio and the room service food definitely need improving.   I had a few small hiccups with the AC in our room and our room key. I believe while traveling that things happen and everyone needs to be more patient, especially with short staffing after the pandemic. The maintenance man who came to fix the AC, as well as the security guard who fixed the battery on our door, were so friendly.   My only negatives are:  - It took 4 phone calls over 3 days to have someone fix the AC and each time I was promised someone would come but they didn't.  - I scheduled a bag pick up for our final morning well in advance and they were half an hour late, which almost prevented us from getting breakfast before leaving. I had to call 3 times before they finally came.  - I ordered room service for my daughter one night and it never came. It was late so I was unable to reach anyone by phone.   Again, I believe everyone is doing the best they can, but just things to note for next time.   I would definitely return to this resort! ",50,1261

I recommend Dreams Tulum. The service and options were excellent. One problem for me loving the ocean was the Seaweed both on the beach and shore made swimming near impossible. The result is packed with amenities and options that are included. I didn’t get to take advantage of all of them which speaks volumes. The personnel consistently awesome! ,10,1261
I found the resort below average and the food was awful.  Paid for an oceanfront room and the pool and bar was right outside the balcony.  It was really loud.  Did not feel like there was much value in the Preferred package.  ,50,1261
"Don’t waste your money at this hotel, there are MUCH nicer hotels in the area for even a lower price and better service and food. There is nothing 5 stars about this place. The super 8 motel are cleaner and nicer than Dreams Tulum. ",50,1261
"This was the greatest experience I had in my life. Our wedding coordinator planned the wedding of our dreams almost entirely via email. She made everybody so simple and easy, she answered all of my questions and executed the wedding of our dreams! The experience was unforgettable, the entire wedding guest list didn’t want to leave, we all had the time of our lives!",50,1261
"We were originally supposed to go to The Beach Tulum in March 2020… and we all know how that went. Finally, 2 years later, we were able to make it. My friends, I have found paradise and I wish I never had to leave. Five stars.  The good: - The resort itself is just magic. Magic. It feels like you have it all to yourself. There are only 28 rooms, and we had a junior suite with the private plunge pool, so it was secluded and private and perfect.  - The room is amazing. Air conditioned so you can get out of the heat (this is important!!!). I don’t know how they managed to keep the room 100% free of bugs, but they did. Comfortable bed, understated luxury furnishings, just wonderful. - the plunge pool. Omg. Perfect temperature, perfect mix of sun and shade, a little shade bed that",50,1262
" you can sit on and dip your toes in the water!  - the regular pools! Fun to bounce around. - the spa!!!! We got two 90-minute massages because my fiancé is perfect and loves to spoil us. I was dealing with so much neck pain from two pandemic years. After this vacation? Gone.  - the beach!!! Warm water, gorgeous ocean. We went during seaweed season and even when other parts of the beach were overrun, the beach at The Beach (lol) was the cleanest and clearest of all. Gorgeous sparkling waters for us. - room service! Order by WhatsApp and get ceviche and margaritas delivered to your private sun bed on the beach.  - the restaurants! The catch of the day at Ziggy’s is a must try. The matcha chia pudding at Fresco is a revelation. Everything is so fresh.  The bad: - I struggled to think of anything for this. I got a sunburn but that was my fault, and I found some wild-growing aloe to put on it. One of the days, my breakfast smoothie wasn’t perfectly blended? I don’t know. There wasn’t anything bad. The Beach is perfect and you should go as soon as you can.",50,1262
…,50,1262
"I really loved this resort.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating.  The restaurants were fantastic.  Ziggys was right on the beach with entertainment nightly. A special thank you to the staff at Frescos who made our breakfasts a special part of our day.  We ate almost all of our meals at the resort when we realized the quality and freshness just couldn't be beat!  Great vegetarian and vegan options.  The beach is amazing and the property is well kept.  No shoes necessary here!  The location was the best!.  We utilized the fitness center which offers air conditioning and the spa which was really nice.  Again, the spa staff were just so warm and friendly.  The resort uses WhatsApp to communicate to you while you are there and it is very efficient.  Ordering room service is",50,1262
 easy.  Any request is made with a prompt reply.  I can't say enough about the concierge.  They were on top of everything we needed!  Our room was the king bedroom on the beach and we were so close!  There is nothing I can say bad about this hotel.  We will definitely stay here again.  It was our first time to Tulum and what a great first visit!,40,1262
…,50,1262
"We travel the world often and look for the best hotels wherever we travel. We enjoyed The Beach Hotel for so many reasons. The staff is exceptionally helpful with all our requests. It’s a small, luxury hotel with rooms directly on the beach. The rooms are charming, comfortable and very clean. We had a patio with a jacuzzi, lounge chairs and a bed on a private deck above our bedroom. The hotel is on a white sandy beach within walking distance to excellent restaurants and shops. The concierge made reservations at an impossible ti get reservations restaurant. Service in every way couldn’t have been better.",20,1262
"The moment we arrived we were blown away by this hotel. The service, the hospitality, the room!!!! Really a relaxing couples vacation.  Relaxing is an understatement. Was so quiet and calming. The pool outside the room, the plunge poop in the room. The room service to the beach. The restocking thr fridge with complimentary waters and nuts. The spa. The complimentary sauna and cold and got pools. The watsapp service. We got complimentary strawberries in chocolate and petals on our bed as we were baby mooning. This hotel was exemplary! The only problem was the the seaweed on the beach. Made it impossible to swim in the ocean and we are big beach people.  Otherwise I would come back to this hotel again and again.  Thank u The beach tulum for an unbelievable stay!",50,1262
"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at The Beach Tulum. The few criticisms that I do have below are simply because there are many hotel options nearby that would deliver a similar (or better) experience for less $$.  Accommodations: We selected a room on the second level that included a rooftop pool/jacuzzi, but never ended up using it as there was no shade and we preferred to be out on the beach at Ziggy's. In hindsight, now seeing that the rooms on the main floor were not accessible from a busy beach area as we feared, we would select one of those rooms in the future. Overall, the room was very comfortable, clean and enjoyable. I already miss having my morning coffee from the comfort of our ocean view hammock!  Facility: Really beautiful resort - cannot beat the tranquility",50,1262
" and beauty of the common area. Thank being said, if you are a person who likes to hang around a pool vs. the beach, this is probably not the place for you as I think we only saw people actually around the pool one time. It's more of an aesthetic feature than an actual swimming pool.  Location: Very convenient + central location for walking to various restaurants, beach clubs, etc. Not specific to The Beach Tulum, but we were surprised that the main road was not better designed for pedestrians and biking.  Staff: The staff was always very kind and helpful. We really enjoyed the convenience of communicating to them via WhatsApp and always had great responsiveness. Erik and Funky at Ziggy's were very sweet and helpful.  Restaurants: Fresco's wasn't our favorite service or food, but nice option to try for breakfast. We really enjoyed Ziggy's both during the day and at night. The food was excellent as were the cocktails. I wish they'd had some light music playing around the beach beds during the day for a little energy!  Policy: I will echo other reviews that it seems the staff may not be empowered to or understand when to apply discretion in terms of some hotel policies. We hired a photographer to come and take photos while we said our vows, so I made the resort aware that I would be meeting her at the front entrance and escorting her myself. They advised that I would be fined $100 to have a guest on the property to which I responded I understood and instead we would just go to the beach. When she arrived, I was not finished getting ready so I did meet her and escort her to our room so I could finish up (~10minutes) and I immediately received a message from the front desk scolding me. While I am thankful they did not end up charging us, it just felt unnecessary given the circumstances and that I went out of my way to ensure there would be no issues.  All in all, it was a great stay but there are many options along this beach strip in Tulum where you could pay less for a great experience (I can confirm this because we did stay at another resort as well).",50,1262
"I booked the hotel for 4 nights however I left and changed for another resort because I had very bad experience.  The hotel staff is very unskilled. Due to their poor knowledge, I had heavy accident (the staff placed the bastet with water, to wash the feets in the middle of the road under the stairs from the room, which is impossible to see in the night).   The hotel neither apologize for that. However I had to undergo several doctor’s visits and I had completely ruined holiday due to this matter.  The hotel promised to refund me the money for the remaining nights as I was not comfortable staying there however up till today I did not received anything from them.  Everytime I contact them, they answer to me that they will check everything and let me know or they don’t even",10,1263
" answer. They should refund the money within 36 days since I left, that’s what they told me when I went away.   So the hotel neither apologized for what happen, neither offered compensation, neither paid for the medical expanses I had due to them BUT they also did not refund me my money which they have to refund as my reservation allowed the refund!  Absolutely horrible experience.  And Note also, that there is noise in the rooms (from the night clubs) for the entire night.",50,1263
…,50,1263
Highly recommend Ahau to anyone. The ocean view room was very beautiful. The staff was all friendly and good to us. They made us feel at home and did an Amazing job with everything. The food and drinks are delish!!  Tanet was very helpful in getting our reservations going. The staff decorator my room beautiful for my bday. Javier was very helpful in showing us how to get to Daniel Popper art work. Loved everything bout it. Although I wouldn’t recommend visiting in May because it’s extremely hot and the seaweed takes over the beaches leaving it smelly. We made the most of our trip thanks to the DJ and staff.,50,1263
I have stayed at Ahau Multiple Times and Every time is even better than the previous.  Room number 4 is spectacular and the view is incredible. The food is to die for and so are the drinks. Every worker is happy all the time and that shows how the employees are treated . Literally Ahau us a Piece is Heaven . Highly recommended ,50,1263
"First of all, let us thank Jesus at the outdoor bar for welcoming us and making us feel like family. We had just finished getting a workout in at the outdoor gym up the beach and when walking down spotted the Ahau beach bar. We sat down for a drink and Jesus came right over to help us out. He was super informative, super welcoming and such a great guy.  A few drinks turned into a lot of drinks, some of the best food we have ever eaten in Mexico in 15 years of coming down and by far and wide the best day trip we have made. The beach bar inside and out was absolutely beautiful with the coolest aesthetic, super comfortable seating in ample shade (sun available too) and a plunge pool that we hung out in for quite a while. The music outside was also superb, not sure who is curating",30,1263
" the playlist but they deserve a bonus.  When we finally decided to leave, Jesus got us towels and told us all about the events that take place across the year with fun parties that we should come and check out. That's exactly what we're doing, as we spent the entire rest of our vacation in our all-inclusive resort wishing we were back at Ahau and planning a trip to revisit immediately. Sadly for our all-inclusive resort it is doubtful we ever return.  Thanks Jesus and the Ahau team and we can't wait to be back.",50,1263

"We stayed one night in the upper Bali Hut room and fell in love with Ahau and Tulum   We took the transportation from Cancun recommended by Ahau. They waited at the wrong hotel & we had to call so pick up was late, but the drive was great. The driver was so friendly. He lives in Tulum and was giving us all of his recommendations and told us all about Tulum.   The check in process was okay. Someone was in the office (only one check in at a time) so we had to wait, but that was no problem for us. The staff seemed very apologetic for the wait, and we were also offered welcome drinks while we waited. There was some confusion about us still owing money for the shuttle - I thought they had already charged me since I asked them to via email but they hadn’t. The hotel handled it so",50,1263
" well. They told me I could check my bank statements and let them know what I found out at check out. Our room was ready early, and I believe his name was Daniel? walking us to our room and gave us a little tour inside the room before leaving.   We took a taxi to the in town Tulum Jungle Gym (not partnered with Ahau. The taxi was $25 there, $35 back and the gym entrance was $15 per person). The taxi was simple to get. There were a bunch waiting behind Ahau on the Main Street with all the restaurants and stores and clubs. And we just stepped out in the street after the gym and waved down a taxi within a few seconds to come back.   The Bali Hut room was sooo aesthetic and beautiful, but I wouldn’t choose that room for staying more than one night. They only run the air conditioning at night (and wow it’s cold air conditioning at night!) but there is a fan above the bed that works really well all day too. But the Bali Hut room is very small. We had 2 suitcases and had room to open them on the floor, but we couldn’t leave them out and open or else there was no where to walk. The room does have a private bathroom with a shower, mirror and toilet. No full length mirror and no tv in the room. And it’s a Bali Hut so no solid walls meant extra humidity and some bugs, although really nothing crazy. We did use the nets around the bed when we slept at night. The shower got nice and hot. They also have a giant jug of filtered water for your use in the bathroom.. such a nice touch. They also have mosquito repellent and aloe in the bathrooms. We will absolutely be booking at Ahau again, but we will be choosing a different room for a longer trip simply due to the solid walls and more space. The Bali Hut was beautiful though, and even though we stayed in the cheapest room for only one night.. we felt treated like royalty by staff just as they would treat someone in any other room or longer stays.   The restaurant. Omg the restaurant. This was the best food we had all week in Mexico. The chicken over couscous for dinner was AMAZING. The drinks.. amazing. The breakfast.. amazing. The chips and guac.. amazing. The views.. amazing. The DJ, the waiters.. all AMAZING. People were coming there to eat who weren’t even staying there because the food is so good. We went on a Sunday night/Monday morning and it was empty. Like 2 other people eating and no one in the pool. So it was insanely relaxing, but I can’t comment on what it would be like if the environment was more of a party atmosphere. There are two cats and one dog that stay on property and the cat hung out by us during our meals. We didn’t mind at all. We love animals. But the staff kept trying to get the cat away and sprayed it with a water bottle (I hope it was just water?) so we did feel bad for the cat haha.   The Main Street with all the restaurants, clubs and shops is right behind the hotel. We felt completely safe walking around at night and can’t wait to go back to experience more of those places. We got some drinks at Gitano and loved just walking around on that street and seeing all the variety. A very fun atmosphere.   We walked to the beach Tulum Jungle Gym the next morning. They are partnered with Ahau and you get free entry, but we booked the private hour before they opened so it was $180 for two people. The walk was quick from Ahau but not right next to it as I had imagined. Just a minute or two away, though, walking on the beautiful beach past some other beautiful beach clubs + what I assume were resorts.   Ahau keeps this property pristine, has kind welcoming staff, and makes you feel like royalty staying there. The boho jungle vibes are so unique. The beach and pool was empty the whole time we were there (Sunday night/Monday morning).   One thing I will say is that music played the entire night.. not sure where it was coming from but it truly didn’t turn off. Not even at 3am or 4am when one would assume clubs are closed. And with no solid walls, it was tough to sleep. Not sure if the sound is any better in a different room type or maybe a room closer to the beach.  We 100% plan on staying at Ahau again and will be counting down the days until we can eat at their restaurant again, too.  We stayed in Mexico for a week and nothing compared to our night at Ahau.",50,1263
"Azulik is an experience which shouldn’t be missed. The place, food and service is fantastic! The tseen-ja restaurant was a highlight! And especially the team along with Luciano who was our attendant for the night made it a memorable experience. Luciano also brought us a special cake to celebrate my wife’s birthday on such short notice! Kudos to the team at azulik!",50,1264
"Luis Miguel’s service at Kin Toh was incredible. While staying at Azulik, we hadn’t made reservations for dinner and the restaurant was fully booked. But he quickly found a space for us, and even though he was juggling many other responsibilities through our dinner, served impeccably. In addition to the service, the food was amazing. The lamb, venison, short ribs, and everything else were perfection. Highly recommend!",50,1264

"The service at this place is absolutely awful, the staff are rude, unprofessional and obnoxious. They think they are doing you a favor letting you dine at the place.   I had to constantly email them to ask that they could confirm the booking after paying £1500.00 to reserve the tables and every time they replied back with incorrect information and didn't not put a contact name who was dealing with it.  On the day we arrived at 4.50pm our booking was at 5pm, the door staff were rude acted like gangsters and said we couldn't come in until 5pm till the hostess was ready to come and get us.  Again we had to all wait on the roadside and then the hostess didn't come down till 5.10pm, when we got in all the hostess wanted to do was take more money off me in advance they pushed a card",10,1264
" machine in my face and said pin number.  The whole experience felt like I was being extortion for money.  Finally at the end of the night after we paid the bill and the waiter insisting that we pay him a 20% tip my husband went downstairs to check the taxi was there and on returning to the table the  bouncer outside stopped my husband from coming back in, my husband told him that he was dining in the restaurant and that you have just seen me come out to check for the taxi.  The bouncer replied, "" proof that you were in the restaurant"" my husband showed him the bill that he paid and still the bouncer.  My husband said better still you go and get your manager and check yourself that I am at that table.  Overrated",50,1264

"This hotel exceeded my expectations! I’m not one to write reviews but Immediately upon arriving the Copal team made us feel at home. All personnel were friendly. Paco helped us out with our apartment, decorating and giving us great suggestions for dinner in the town. Andres the manager went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. Truly a reason to go back. He personally had them set up a surprise of chocolate covered strawberries and bubbly in our apartment. He maintained contact with us during our stay, available anytime we needed anything. We had 2 bedroom apartment with a private pool. The kitchen was fully stocked with utensils you will need. It was beautiful! Clean, sleek, modern with a touch of jungle vibes which we loved. We couldn’t get over the scent of",50,1265

"My boyfriend and I just spent a week at Villa Pescadores in Tulum. Absolutely attentive staff, they definitely go the extra mile. We can recommend staying here, we definitely enjoyed it.  However, please bear in mind that this hotel is rather secluded, which we actually deemed as great. However this means that you either need to take a bicycle (still takes a lot of time, and it's hot), an expensive taxi (believe me, you'll be shocked, but that's Tulum for you), or, the best option: Rent a car.",50,1267

Just returned from a 4 day stay at Villa Pescadores.  Ended up extending my stay by one day because I just couldn't leave.  Very well appointed rooms for the price.  Loved that it had a little refrigerator to keep some cold drinks on hand.  Beds were so comfortable that it was hard to get out of bed in the morning.  I had some of the best sleeps ever here.  Staff was amazing - nothing was too big of an ask for them and everyone was pleasant and accommodating.  Breakfast was delicious and the tacos govbenores were outstanding.  Beach club was very comfortable and music was just right.  The sea was full of sargasso - but the pool was delightful.  If you are thinking of booking here - don't hesitate.   Book the deluxe room on the second floor - gorgeous! Can't wait to go back!,50,1267

The staff works hard to help you with your needs.  Oh…and the “welcome drink” is a fantastic cocktail. Thank you to the staff…Lily and Quique in the office. A big shout out to Joel and Angel at the restaurants.",50,1267

Lovely place! Food was delicious and Ross was a wonderful server. Sucks that the beach has so much seaweed this time of year but still a great place to relax and quite a few people around. Would recommend!,50,1267
"We stayed at this beautiful accommodation for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute. The location is extremely peaceful, a little oasis of heaven. The beach club was perfect with amazing food and drinks. The staff were incredibly friendly, courteous and efficient, nothing was too much trouble. Special shout out to Russell, who made us feel special from day one and does his job with pride and enjoyment. Thank you to all and we look forward to returning one day :)  ",50,1267
"Top day at the beach club food was class, drinks were class all the people who served us were great, Raphael our main waiter was top draw, top bloke along with his pal David and not to mention isai and honer, some boys. Would defo recommend and would also love to go again.",50,1268
"I first stayed at Ana y Jose back in Oct’20 mainly because of its location: beach side in the hotel zone and few minutes walk to some of the best restaurants in Tulum.  Had an amazing experience and ended up staying with them again in December for 10 nights! The rooms are great and cleaned multiple times/day, the restaurants serves some of the most delicious food and the best part is the staff.  The staff is very friendly and make you feel like home.  Also the concierge team in particular Paulina was very helpful with giving activity and restaurant recommendations/reservations.  Highly recommended! ",50,1268
"everything was excellent, food and service, and location, and staff!! They made us feel at home, and safe, and we could not have asked for a better hotel experience.  I would highly recommend this hotel.",50,1268

"Great location and amazing staff. Basic amenities in the room. We had a shared pool which was cool. The hotel offers beach beds and towels, the beach is breathtaking! Do not recommend having breakfast in the hotel; the cafeteria is way below expectations.",40,1268
"This is probably my 5th or 6th stay at Ana Y Jose. I love it that much. The customer service is top notch. The location is prime. The grounds are so beautiful. The food is fantastic! The drinks are tasty. I've stayed at almost all the different type of suites and can honestly say, that from the smallest to the largest, I was never disappointed. ",50,1268
"Our stay at Ana y José was a wonderful time away and the beach service from Rafael and David was amazing. They were kind, attentive and surprised us with a special birthday treat unprovoked. Thank you again for taking such good care of us!",50,1268
"Amazing service! Rafael at the beach, Antionio, and jaavy, all Extraordinary service. The food is great, the service is excellent. The beach had some  seaweed but the hotel works hard at clearing it out. We didn’t do any sightseeing we just hung and the beach and pool for seven days!",50,1268
"We dined at Maratea our last night in Mexico and could not have been more pleased with the service or the food. Our server Ernesto was attentive all evening without being intrusive. We started with the beef carpaccio and the pumpkin seed humus. Both were excellent. I had the seafood soup next. Presentation and preparation were both perfect. The broth was well-developed and pouring it over the shrimp, clam, mussels, and fish at the table and then combining it with the crouton made it fun and whimsical. My wife had the rack of lamb which she loved and I had the grilled octopus - very tender and another beautiful presentation. The chef stopped by our table, but regrettably I did not get his name. He was very personable and it was a nice touch. Serena was the restaurant manager and",50,1269
 she also stopped by our table a couple of times. She also handled an uncomfortable situation with some rude customers at a different table with grace and professionalism. We finished the night with the hazelnut chocolate lava cake and then made our way back to the room to catch an early flight home. This was the perfect dining experience to end a fabulous trip to the Conrad.,50,1269
…,50,1269
"Recently opened, the Conrad Tulum in Akumal is a true gem on the beautiful Mayan Riviera.  The entire staff was welcoming, gracious, and expertly trained.  As the hotel just recently opened, it was running at low occupancy for the period I was there, so it really felt as though I had a private resort all to myself,  this will change in the near future I'm sure.  The main takeaway I would like to convey about the Conrad, and a feature which separates the property from other resorts in the area is that it is a dining-first destination. The food and beverage manager should be commended for seeking out many of the top chefs in Mexico city to lead a culinary tour-de-force across the hotels many restaurants.  The consistency across each of the restaurants from Autor (fine dining set",50,1269
" course menu) to Ukai (edo style sushi/omakase) to Arbolea for breakfast was remarkable.  Both Autor and Ukai are well deserving of a Michelin star at each location, I would highly encourage visitors to order the set course menus at each and you will be well-rewarded.  I had a number of requests throughout my stay, each expertly handled by their superb concierge named Angel via text/IM.  Jonathan, Marcos and Victoria also did a wonderful job making me feel at home when I was dining on my own at the property's great restaurants.  Javier the GM also checked in on me to make sure everything was going well.    All in all, a perfect resort experience, and so good that I will be returning for a second visit this weekend!",40,1269

"Absolutely stunning property! The people and the service we will remember the most! From Milagros, the very nice concierge, who kept in contact throughout are journey and to the housekeeping staff who always cleaned our room. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. was exemplary, professional, courteous, and genuinely warm. I have never received such amazing Customer Service on that level before. Such a delight! Beautiful location. Mind blowing spa! (Do the nopal treatment!) I said the people and the service is what we will remember the most. I wasn't kidding. THEY are the reason we will be coming back. I would like to mention a few employees who were the stars of our stay. At the bar that overlooks the beach and the Mediterranean restaurant, Maratea, (went there 4 times) the staff was truly",50,1269
" exceptional. Pardon my spelling, but I would like to thank Javier, Graciasilliano, Sarena, Abraham, Giovanni, and Jesus. The most delightful, friendly, and fun staff we have ever encountered! Your property is blessed because of them. Also, Milagros. She was the first contact we had before, during, and after our stay. Professional, friendly, and efficient. Also, Maria who works in Arbolea,(breakfast restaurant) was very accommodating and always gave us our favorite table. The cooks and staff was amazing as well. Bravo! We cannot wait to come back and have the pleasure to be around amazing people again. Next time, we will be bringing our friends and family, so that they will be blown away as we have. Congratulations, Conrad Tulum Riviera Maya. Your staff will keep this amazing property on everyone’s wishlist!",50,1269

"Wonderful seaside location with exceptional food and drinks. Eric and Marco took excellent care of us - highly recommend. Prices are high, but they everywhere in the tourist area. If you’re going to spend the money, go here.",50,1270
"First I want to Thank all the amazing staff. I wish I remember the name of all of them. The bell boys that carried our luggage thru the jungle for our gorgeous bedroom Federico and Luis. Amazing! Another Luis our great server at the Beach Club, he make sure we had a great time with all the pampering. The food was outstanding. I need the recipe of the Yellow Habanero sauce. Our room was cozy with a superb view. Felt so in love how the architecture played with nature without harming the jungle vibe. Thanks Charlie for all your suggestions and recommendations. Also, for teaching us the way and locations of everything. Thanks to Laia that assisted us with our Covid Test in the facilities making it perfect for our return home. We wish we could stay there longer. Thanks for having us!",50,1270
Words do not do PPP justice. Our friend group litigated hotel options for weeks before giving the edge to PPP. We have been truly blown away. Ignacio specifically went above and beyond in ensuring we were taken care of. He upgraded our room to a beautiful villa with jaw dropping views. Fernanda was also key in making our stay unforgettable.,50,1270
The hotel was very nice and the staff was fantastic.  Erick and Pasquale specifically took great care of us at the restaurant.  We had a beautiful ocean view room.  We also did the yoga class on a Friday morning and it was very enjoyable.  We definitely recommend.,50,1270
"Had an incredible breakfast with Eric & Juan at Papaya Playa. Presentation was beautiful, food was great and the view was perfect. Eric and Juan provided some of the best service of our trip. Great vegetarian and healthy options. We will be back!!!!",50,1270
Andres and Luis were very attentive and very welcoming. Andres is very knowledgeable about the drinks and explained to me the difference between Mezcal and Tequila….now I know haha. Mezcal is the winner!! Very good service and they made sure that you are having a good time.,50,1270
"Came here with my friends and Ignacio made our experience AMAZING! He was very welcoming from the get-go and made all the difference in the experience. The other staff was also amazing, but we really owe it to Ignacio. Thank you so much man!!!",50,1270
This place is absolutely fantastic! The quality of service is beyond anything I’ve ever experienced at any other hotel. Ignacio truly made sure everything about our first Tulum experience was perfect. He was very professional and friendly in welcoming us to the property and really took care of us. The accommodations will blow you away!,50,1270
"This place is top notch! Flew in with a few friends and they took care of us right away. Excellent room service and vibes. Papaya Playa is a perfect combination of relaxing, nature and nightlife.   One employee to name specifically was Ignacio. It was our first time in Tulum and he was a huge help in getting our room set up and teaching us about the city layout.   Thanks again Ignacio!",50,1270
"We came two days in a row to the beach club and had a wonderful experience. Rodolfo was so helpful and charismatic. My boyfriend wanted a guava cocktail, but he said they were out of guava. He came back a few minutes later with guava’s he had picked fresh and made us guava margaritas! Beautiful location and kind staff. Thank you Rodolfo and Erick.",50,1270
"Spacious clean rooms, we did have hot water and a very powerful shower. The staff were friendly but they did look as though they needed a shower No breakfast here but we found a very good place near by",30,1271
"I paid about $26 for one night. Motel has a fine location, an affordable price, and the spacious rooms are actually clean and decent with A/C. But...they don't accept credit cards, they do not have hot water in the shower (I asked the guy if they had hot water, and he said ""yes."" They don't), and there is a bar in the courtyard which had noisy patrons which disturbed me late at night AND early in the morning...  It's a shame: if they took credit cards, if they had at least warm water, and if there was no noise issue, I'd recommend this place unreservedly as a solid budget option. But until they fix these issues, I'd have to say only stay here if there's no other decent alternative...",20,1271
Skip this place.  Staff still friendly and helpful. Access blocked by street work. Rooms suffering from tracked mud and termites have a good start on eating the place.  It had been a suitable and good bargain; it isn't any more.,20,1271
This motel is in a small side street and so us quiet but you miss the wonderful sunrises over the Sea of Cortez. The rooms are simple but comfortable and ensuite. Beds and linen are clean on arrival but unless you ask you may not get a daily service. The outside covered bar is a nice space. Nothing wrong with the hotel but nothing to entice us back again.,30,1271
"Typical 2 star budget hotel, the problem I had was that the clerk assured me that they had hot water  which turned out to be untrue.... if you do not mind lukewarm to cool showers then by all means stay there... 500 pesos a night which is a fair price... moved out after 2 nights into a step up as I require hot showers.",20,1271
Basic Motel Style with a convenient courtyard seating area.  the rooms were clean.  The bed was comfortable. everything was clean. nice large shower and free wi- fi but didn't work good in my room. this is a good value for the price .This Hotel  is located near the center of town. You can walk 2 blocks to the Ocean. The old mission is about three long blocks walk away. Located on a quiet side street so you may drive past if you are not watching.,30,1271
"This is our third visit to this motel. We were the only ones there this time. I think there is only about 5 or six rooms. There is a bar/restaurant that was not open this time, right on the property. I'm sure they would have opened for us, because they are so accommodating. The room was very clean and the air conditioning worked nicely. Oh, and they allowed pets, as we travel with a small Brussels Griffon.",40,1271
"El Dorado is a basic little motel located just a block away from the Malecon/ the beach in Loreto. A economical choice among the pricey hotels surrounding the downtown and beach area. The hot water usually works in the evenings and the motel is located on a quiet side street, so no need for earplugs. They have a few parking spots which is a plus if you are driving.",30,1271
"I have stayed at the El Dorado seven times over the years, the latest this last weekend 9/21-9/23. Always clean rooms with great air-conditioning, the staff is helpful and friendly (to the extreme). I fly groups of fishermen down to Loreto and always recommend that they stay hear. It's family owned and run and while small it's quite safe with good food within a short walk. Larry",40,1271
"Our room was clean and comfortable.  A couple things in our room didn't work right, but were being fixed and the people managing the motel were very accomodating and helpful.  The motel is close to everything in town.  We could easily walk to anywhere in Loreto from the motel.  The service was good and the people friendly.  I liked  staying there. There is a cute little girl who I think lives there. ",40,1271
"Es un hotel muy limpio y muy bien cuidado. Es atendido por sus propietarios que se esmeran por qué te la pases bien. Te dan pequeños tours a sus viñedos (no muy lejos de ahí) y a pequeñas presas, donde se acumula agua de un ojo cercano. No tiene alberca, ni estacionamiento, h el internet es intermitente. Si te quieres desconectar del mundo, aquí.",40,1272
"In una zona defilata rispetto alla cittadina, l'hotel si trova in un'area piuttosto selvaggia. Struttura essenziale ma architettonicamente la trovo splendida. Direttamente sul mar di Cortez in uno scenario naturale unico. Dotato di tutti i confort, in primis A/C efficiente visto che ci troviamo nella parte più calda (la zona di Loreto) di una zona (la Baja California - Mexico) di per sé caldissima. 37° all'1.30 di notte è esplicativo... ma vedere i delfini che di notte vengono a saltellare nel tratto di mare davanti alla porta della tua camera non ha prezzo. I colori del cielo al tramonto sono indescrivibili... e il mare, il mar di Cortez, è qualcosa di sensazionale. Baja ti entra nel cuore e nell'anima: indimenticabile.",50,1273
"I have stayed at the Camino Real, now the Loreto Bay Inn many times. It is never very crowded and the rooms are very nice. Nice beach and pool areas. There are 2 bars and 2 restaurants for drinks and food. The food is good but the prices are a little high.   The property is very clean, modern and so are the rooms. Only a few miles out of Loreto but worth the trip. The staff was very helpful and friendly.",40,1273

"Shocked to know that this Desert Inn is owned and operated by the government of Mexico. 7 friends and I (fishing trip) took a chance on it and discovered it was all we had hoped for and more...at about half the price we expected.  Beautiful facilities: a waterfront location on the sand beach of the Sea of Cortez...perfect. Staff was friedly and very helpful. The restaurant’s food was sub-par but the wait staff was frienly, accomodating and cheerful. I’m going back!",50,1274
"My husband and I met some friends in Loreto for a weekend visit. We stayed in the Desert Inn and found it to be well located and very clean. The rooms are very spacious with good amenities; shower, coffee, blankets, pillows, etc... The restaurant was good and the employees were great! I would definitely stay here again!",40,1274
"Excellent clean room with wonderful views, just on the northern edge of town.  Very little English spoken. There is an attractive swimming pool but weather wasn't suitable for swimming.  It was a real bargain.",40,1274
"We really enjoyed this hotel. It is right on the beach and walking distance to the Malecon. There was one other couple staying there so we were really surprised no one else was staying there! Only downside was no one that worked there could speak any English. Not even a little bit. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant and the stay was very good. ",50,1274
"We were hoping to recreate our wonderful experience at Desert Inn in San Ignacio. Not so!!!! The staff could have cared less that we were there, asked for a ground level room, got one on second floor because there were only two rooms occupied so they just put us next to the other rooms for their convenience! Went to eat in their restaurant and were given old chicken because that was all they had! Will never return! We do not need fancy but travel for many reasons and dealing with people who are not trained to be happy that you are there will support our decision not to return!",20,1274
"A surprise at $47 a night for my honey and our two pups. I thought it would be twice that. That was a posted price, so not an odd moment. Nice pool, great restaurant and service. Huge double porch area. Room had a lot of space.  Open a sliding glass door to the covered porch and walk on the very long beach until you're tired, then turn and go back. At the end of the  malecón beach, so less noise.  Wake up to a gorgeous sunrise pouring in.   Hardly anyone there when we were there in February, 2017. A very short walk downtown along the beach. Wifi was only in reception area, so more quality time in our room and brief checking emails over breakfast. When we arrived back home in Oregon I went online to see how much a round trip airfare was. I want to come back and spend more time. I",40,1274

"This is a Baja style resort just N of the Loreto Malecon meaning it is a bit rough but has all the amenities you would expect(pools, restaurant, bar).  If you get lucky as we were, you might meet some Mexican Tele-Novella stars, since during our last stay they were filming at the resort. The Desert Inn has buildings that house up to around 24 rooms and several 4 plexes that house the accommodations we chose.  For around $60 US you get a pet friendly suite that include 2 kings, fireplace, entry, nice bath, and a deck to take in the Sea of Cortez.  Oh, air conditioning too.",50,1274
"My friend & I are fisherman and Coco's worked out very well for us. I've been visiting Loreto for about 10yrs for the fishing & stayed at many different places but Coco's may be the best value in town. It's only about a 5+ minute walk to the marina which saved us cab fare. Eva, the manager was so helpful in helping us obtain a Covid test & Stephen picked up our test results too. Thank you very much!  This place is very clean , quiet (no roosters crowing), & everything works in the room. I definitely would return here.",50,1275
"If you stay more than once, CC will get in your blood, and you will be back!  I am always amazed that, every visit, there is always someone we know from previous visits. Many are like us, with repeat stays. The level of repeat visitors should be something to note. Great owner, staff, location, accommodations, and “vibe”! The words “homey, but private” come to mind. Accommodations are simple, but more than adequate, after all, you’re not in Loreto to sit in your room! Staff can assist you with anything you need from laundry svc, taxi, dining recommendations, tours and, of course, fishing guides!  Look, just remember where you’re at and enjoy the slower pace and wonderful people. Remember that accessibility to some things is different here. If you want something, ask for it rather",50,1275

"Coco Cabanas have much to recommend them. Foremost is the owner and staff. Steve, the owner, is excellent at what he does. He made us feel very welcome, even giving us fresh fruit from his garden.. If we needed a recommendation or a connection, he was right there with all sorts of suggestions. If we wanted to sit under our umbrella and read quietly, he disappeared. Eva, the manager of the property, was also a treasure. She had the best laugh and she made sure all went smoothly. The casita was very clean and comfortable. CC is close enough to town to make walking to restaurants easy, but far enough away that it is very quiet. All in all, a great place to vacation.",50,1275
"We stayed at Coco Cabana (#4) for a week, and there are no complaints! It was the perfect place to stay, clean, quiet and relaxing! The cabana is bigger than it looks in the photos, with a king bed, kitchen, and bathroom- everything you need! It’s only a short easy walk to the beach, malecon and town, so really the perfect location! The staff and owner, Stephen are all wonderful and we will definitely be back!",50,1275
"My husband and I went to Loreto for almost 2 weeks and stayed at Casa Cabañas.  It was the perfect place for us- quiet and clean, air-conditioned, staff were super friendly, and just the relaxing place we had hoped for located in a safe and family-oriented neighborhood. We were close enough to walk everywhere we needed to go and were delighted to receive recommendations from Eva and Stephen on which captain to take for a trip to Isla Coronado and to offer guidance on everything from where to find the best fish tacos to how to cook our own chocolate clams.  If you go, don't miss out on Roberto's homemade muffins (they're the best) and I highly recommend Francisco Mayoral as a guide on the water.   This is a wonderful place and we hope to return.",30,1275
"After 15 years, Loreto has truly become our second home, and staying at the CC is like staying with family! We have stayed in both the Casitas and the Cabanas and found each to fit our needs at different times. They’ve always been clean, have the necessary amenities, and a quick response to any request we’ve had. Stephen is a wealth of accurate and honest local knowledge, and can help your arrange any type of outing or activity, and can connect you with some of the best fishing guides in Loreto (who don’t need websites or advertising)!

Small, clean pool, fiber optic internet , fully stocked kitchens, although I recommend eating out- lots of good choices all in easy walking range, friendly staff, free bikes, movies, and phone calls. Be sure to check you the library and the common area is a great place to meet your Casita “neighbors”. Liz the owner, is a resource for anything.   Warning! do not try to get availability dates or prices off the Trip advisor site! Or any other booking server. It directs you to other hotels and makes it look like there is no availability!

You get what you pay for and this is true here, not the cheapest but worth it. This was my second visit and new this year compared to last year's visit is high speed internet, all new comfy beds, fresh paint and some new artwork inside.  Also my room had a new larger refrigerator and a new AC/Heater which was whisper quiet and super cold. The new murals around the courtyard and pool are beautiful and add to the colorful plants and palm trees between each casita.  Booking a casita is a little harder than some hotels as you have to contact the hotel via email - they do not use any of the booking",50,1276

"this hotel was recommended by another hotel owner in Baja, and it certainly didn't disappoint. It was very clean and super centrally located in the town centre. The hotel room was very spacious with two huge double beds, which were the most comfortable beds we had slept on in a long time! The hotel complex was very tastefully decorated and had a true holiday vibe to it. The staff were very efficient and friendly. I would definitely come here again and can highly recommend it. It's on my favourite list :-)",50,1277

"This hotel does not seem to show up booking websites.  You can book directly online by emailing them.  The price is 1320 for the regular room per night.  If you show up at the hotel, it's about 1380.  If you book earlier, they seem to want you to pay with PayPal.  At this time, they accept paying when you show up.    There is no room shortage.  In fact, most of the rooms were not occupied during my stay.  The WIFI is cutting in and out even near the reception area.    You can see the church from the 2nd floor balcony.  You can walk to the central church by crossing the street north.  It is that close.    The rooms are very dated.  The lighting is poor inside the room.  But the room is clean.

"Right on the main street, secure parking (and a covered area for motorcycle parking), clean rooms, excellent Internet, and great price. Easy walk to the oceanfront and you are surrounded by good restaurants. You definitely want rooms away from the street - in high season, I imagine that the street is very loud with music and cars and voices, as this is very much a beach vacation town. You have to ask for hangers. We stayed here three nights on our way South in Baja and another night on our way back. They make breakfast right out in the courtyard, to order (omelets). Added bonus: there is a motorcycle mechanic, Omar, about four blocks away, so if you are having motorcycle problems, as we did, he's quite nearby! For us, this hotel kinda feels like our home in Baja - simple, quiet,",30,1277

Take time to rest and calm your mind. The bed was very spacious and the lady looked after me very well. I highly recommend it . One block from the boardwalk and Orlandos restaurant near Calvary chapel Loreto,40,1278
I stayed there.  I was on a boat for 2 weeks and needed a shower and wifi.  It was quaint clean friendly and quiet.  There was  a place for me to read outside my room I could walk to the beach and I could walk to the circle where the bus picked me up  heading North.,40,1278
"It is very clean, air conditioning included, confortable and lovely posada. The staff is very kind and willingness to help you. It is very close to the Malecon & to the port where all the tours exit. There are stores & restaurants to eat around everything at 2-5 minutes walking distance. They have free filtered water and coffee (all the mornings). They cover the basics for travelers at a very good value.",50,1278
"The Posada is super close to the Malecon & to the port where all the tours exit. There are stores & restaurants to eat around everything to walking distance. Loreto is a very nice & beautiful town. My husband & our mothers decided to stay in here because not only they answered back our calls, the owners were welcoming & later they just let us in their place as it was your home. All mornings they´ve water for coffee & the. There are few rooms (named as countries) so make sure to call to let the hostess know about your arrival. It is a clean place, for lodging. If you expect a luxury place this is not it, they cover the basics for travelers. Feel free to ask for shampoo & soap when you arrive, enjoy your time in Loreto!",40,1278
"I stayed here because it was pet friendly and recommended by Lonely Planet as a good value. I stayed in #2, it was very small and the bed was very hard. If you're a light sleeper this is a noisy location. They have internet but it was sketchy at best and the TV didn't work. The shower was hot and the towels were decent but the room was a bit grimy. The staff was friendly but they kept my pillow. About two hours after I checked out I realized I left my blanket and favorite pillow behind. I went back and the woman ""Gabby"" was cleaning the room next to mine. She went next door to retrieve my blanket, (it was damp...) and said ""no almohada"" so in a matter of two hours my pillow disappeared. This place was average but on the cusp of poor. I left here for Motel Angra which was a huge",30,1278

"Visited here February 2014 for one night and I enjoyed it.  It was a quiet night and I slept well.  The owners are very nice and helpful.  They allowed me to keep one of my bags in their office and hang some of my clothes on their clothes line.  Nice little garden in the back.  They have free filtered water and coffee.  The hotel is a few blocks from the malecón where you can get a whale watch tour.  The rooms are fairly small and bathroom smaller, but I would stay here again for sure.",40,1278
"I stayed at Martin and Maricruz's Posada San Martin all 5 nights that I was in Loreto last April and I thoroughly appreciated my stay. Martin and Maricruz were very helpful in answering all my questions and in making me feel at home.  The rooms are basic but are nice, comfortable, clean, well located and good value. Coffee was always ready when I got up, which is always greatly appreciated :) I can't wait to go back to Baja and to Loreto in particular! Thank you again to my great hosts.  Muchas gracias Martin y Maricruz. Besos de Canada xx",20,1278

Rooms are nothing fancy - not all have TVs or AC, all are dark, but plenty of hot water, clean rooms and towels daily, and GREAT prices. Wifi is dicey, but there are many places very close with free wifi, so just walk a block to a cafe with outdoor seating for wifi.",30,1278
"This was the perfect property and location for our trip to Loreto!  Only 1 property off the Malecon/Sea of Cortez, 5-10 min walk to restaurants, shops and harbor. The property itself couldn't have been better!!  pool, spa, outside kitchen (although we ate out every night enjoying the abundance of wonderful restaurants) There was ""plenty"" of seating around the pool and also outside for dining. The co-owners Rick & Jill Jackson could not have been more welcoming and helpful with whatever your needs or questions.  We were also fortunate to meet Les & Linda the  other co-owners.  All 4 cabanas were rented and everyone was friendly and social..  This is a ""low key"" place to really enjoy Loreto!  We'll be back for sure :-)",50,1279
"This is a unique property. We had one of four cabanas which surround the pool, with a beautiful garden that is tended every day.The property is about half a block from the malecon, and walking distance to the marina as well as downtown. The hosts, Jill and Rick have set up an expansive outside kitchen for the use of their guests, in the event they want to cook rather than eat out.The property is walled, secure and calm. All of the other guests that we have met there have been friendly, interesting, and engaging. Rick and Jill outdo themselves in making certain that their guests have a comfortable stay, with as many activities as they wish. They arrange for horseback rides, panga rides to snorkel in the waters around the islands, kayaking, scenic rides, and the list goes on and",50,1279
" on. If you're lucky, maybe you'll hear Jill singing with her band at a rehearsal in the patio, or visit Rick's photography and video studio for a virtual tour of the flora and fauna of Southern Baja peninsula. We keep going back, and so will you!",50,1279

"I'd planned on visiting Las Cabanas several years ago. One thing or another got in the way. This year was it. Just got back from a solo adventure down the Baja peninsula. The highlight of my trip was my weeklong stay at Las Cabanas de Loreto. Down to earth luxury. Really helpful in putting me in contact with a local woman I was wanting to meet. The morning Panga outing with Rick was outstanding making memories to last a lifetime. The fully stocked outdoor kitchen/BBQ, the pool and hot tub, all clean and inviting.  I highly recommend a stay at Las Cabanas de Loreto. Wishing I was there now.",50,1279
"My grown children and I had a chance to stay here, it was so relaxing.  Jill and Rick are so kind and helped us figure out things to do and get in touch with people.  I can't think of a better vacation for us, at this time, to be able to relax and have some privacy but also community as well.  Rick takes incredible nature photos and they are everywhere.  We were able to walk and use the bikes to go all over town and along the beach and had great experiences with the guide and restaurants and activities that they suggested.  One night they even brought us takeout pizza to our door :)  Thanks Jill and Rick!!!  Hope we can visit again some day!",50,1279
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Not only do Jill and Rick provide a very comfortable accommodation, they will happily help you take advantage of all Loreto and the area has to offer. Scheduling trips, offering local suggestions and providing lots of extras such as bikes, games, books and a fabulous outdoor kitchen is all part of it.  Ricks photography adorns the rooms and Jill’s margarita .... well, it’s just very good. Great location too. 5 stars!",50,1279
"We booked 4 nights here based on the excellent reviews, and found that they are all true.  Jill and Rick are so friendly and helpful! The property itself is within walking distance to everything you need.  The outdoor area has an amazing kitchen, pool, hot tub, fire pit, pizza oven, bar and more. You can spend the day relaxing here or go do any of the land or water activities in the area. ",50,1279
"From the moment we stepped through the door to the property, Jill was amazing, leading us to the outdoor bar and offering us a welcome Margarita.  Then at our request she booked a captain and ponga for us for the next morning. She then showed us the room where they have wetsuits, beach chairs, umbrellas, hats, snorkel gear etc. which we were welcome to borrow while there. We then rode beach cruisers (free to use by the guests) to town to eat at a restaurant she recommended. This is how our wonderful and relaxing vacation there went. Very safe and homey with a beautiful cabana decorated in some of Rick's photographs.  We made one of our dinners at the outdoor kitchen which is well stocked with spices, etc.  Anyway, I could go on and on but obviously we were very happy there. ",50,1279
 Their concierge services and recommendations made the trip stress free for me.  We will definately come back,50,1279
"We came here for a meal on our last night in town. The hotel has a wonderful patio restaurant overlooking the beach, with cozy tables nestled under the giant fig tree in the courtyard, lit with twinkling lights and candles. Beautiful! The service was impeccable and the food delicious! We were offered a large basket of fresh, warm olive-studded focaccia and rolls with sweet balsamic and olive oil while we waited for our order.  We had the Caprese salad to start with, served with a delicate local goat cheese instead of fresh mozzarella, and some of the best pesto we've ever tasted. For the main course, my husband had the grilled arrachera (skirt steak), served with refried beans and sauteed vegetables, and I had the chicken Cordon Bleu, with rice and vegetables. Everything was",50,1280

The cleaning staff was attentive and very friendly. Nestor at the front desk was fantastic, arranging for a beautiful floral bouquet for our room. The waiter Manuel made our two dinners there memorable with his charm, wit, and excellent service. It was such a great experience we plan to stay again in November along with my sister and her husband.",50,1280
"We have been making the drive up and down the Baja for over 10 years now!    Hotel Oasis has always been a safe, clean, friendly place we have counted on.  It is on the Beach ! We wake up to beautiful sunrises.  Every year they do a little bit better.  Had an amazing meal last night.  Best one yet and Manurl our server was Fantastic!",20,1280
"Good, full breakfasts included. This hotel is about 6-7 minutes walk from the center of the Malecon, and it is the only hotel located directly on the wide sand beach. The rooms are laid out motel style in a long line, separated by the bar and restaurant. Most are single story rooms, with perhaps a dozen  in two 2 story structures, all facing the beach. The restaurant has a large stone patio with tables for dining, and some lounging couches and chairs. Their are a few more upscale accommodations (see Le Mission Hotel across from the malecon with nice views of the water over the main seaside street) but only the Oasis is right on the sand, which we preferred.",50,1280
"The Oasis Hotel isn’t nice. It’s just not a nice place. The room was hollow, sparse and “decorated” as an afterthought. It was not nice. The ""lock” on the room’s “door” was not in any way shape or form protective. Not nice and not secure. The area around the hotel was under construction, so not at all nice in spite of the property sitting against the sand of the beach. The restaurant’s breakfast was, wait for it... really nice!  Thus two instead on one star.  But what really wasn’t nice was the lie. We were called home due to circumstances after the first night of a three night stay and were told that, though we couldn’t receive a refund, we would receive credit for the two nights we’d miss. The hotel has, thus far, reneged on that assurance in spite of our following their",30,1280
" wild-goose-chase instructions for actionable contact. Here’s the rub; we don’t really want to go back there! It really was nasty. But now we’re into the whole principal of the thing game.

Basic accommodation.  our room 4 was just outside the restaurant - which was not a noise issue, actually very pleasant  waitress at dinner was super friendly and fun.  fast service.  great hot cocoa with cinnamon on a cold evening.  yum only CON would be the lack of electrical outlets.  when we get off the road for the day we need to recharge phones and music players and such - so having one extension cord for the TV set up was prohibitive.     our sprinter van fit under the driveway awning - not everything will.  able to find shaded parking.",50,1280
The pool was under repair. Staff decided to have loud get together just a few feet from the of our room. Very loud singing and music at midnight. Parking is behind the building across street in a gate locked area - didn't rally feel secure so we kept valuables with us. Room was clean staff english fair. Morning breakfast was handy - nothing flash but filled a void. All in all it was ok but we would not stay again due to safety and roaming dogs in area. When we left neighborhood the dogs caught wind we had dogs and followed and chased us about 1/4 mile down the road. Very aggressive nature literally trying to attack car. If you have dogs BE WARNED!!!,10,1281
"It is an average price-location hotel. Loreto it is a good lace to visit with a lot of diferent activities to develop, in land coastal and marine locations. The hotel is cheap with standard facilities. ",30,1281
Our group has been coming to Loreto for many years. We usually stay at a hotel near the marina. This time we were only staying for 1 night on the way to another location. We decided to give this hotel a try. The stay was very nice. The price was especially good compared to the other hotel that we usually stay at. The rooms were very clean and the pool and all the areas are well maintained & clean. We tried the margarita offered by the bar next to the pool. They were excellent. The breakfast bar offered were also priced very reasonable and are very good. We will definitely come back again,40,1281

I was not expecting this place to be as cool as it was . staff was excellent , close enough to walk to beach or center . breakfast was fair and convenient  , Downfalls - no fridge in room . beds were below average but for the price a very good value",40,1281
"Nice hotel with friendly staff and very affordable rates. We would definitely stay here again.   Traveled with family and the kids enjoyed the pool. We enjoyed the breakfast too, very simple but well arranged. ",40,1281
"This is not a resort. It is a very acceptable option for a traveler on a budget. The staff was friendly and spoke enough English that we could communicate when we needed. The room was clean and everything functioned without fault. It is surrounded by a 5 foot wall so it is physically separate from the neighborhood but not at all separated from the sounds of the neighborhood. If barking dogs and crowing roosters bother you perhaps you should book one of the resorts. My solution was ear plugs. I never have any security issues, you just have to deal with the fact that life is going on over the wall in the local neighborhood.  Breakfast was included 7-10AM. It was scrambled eggs with bits of ham, a tortilla chip with some kind of sauce dish and I think re-fried beans but they were",40,1281

This time I came back to my go-to-hotel in Loreto, The Hacienda Suites. The staff is excellent and so are the rates. This is a very clean hotel right on the main street into town on the right right after the Santa Fe hotel.   They include a breakfast with the room and it is good. There is a pool and a bar. The restaurant is only open for breakfast but don't let this be an issue as Loreto has many good restaurants for dinner.  Included in the price is free secure parking and WiFi.

Bellmen Octavio during the morning/early afternoon and Benny during the afternoon/evening shifts were outstanding. In addition to taking care of us at the resort, they provided guidance for the surrounding neighborhood and Malecon and the their advice was on point!  Resort definitely could use some TLC but it wasn't a deal breaker. Rooms, pool and common areas were cleaned daily. Beach water was warm and the beers were cold! A very chill place.

"It is close to Loreto - that is a positive.  A $21 cab fare each way.  The rate was $150 per person plus $25 for a golf cart - US dollars.  Utterly ridiculous!  We even challenged hin on the $25 cart fee and he looked at us like we had three heads.  Given the quality of the course - the price should have been about half of what we paid.  Will not be returning to this golf course.  The front nine holes are in the middle of a construction zone of villas and condos.  Hard to navigate the cart pathways - and so bumpy and in disrepair - was not pleasant.  The first nine holes were bare in many spots, dry, little grass.  Little signage to get to next hole.   We almost quit after 9 because it had been so  'not fun'.  But having paid for 18, we decided to do a few more holes.  The back",20,1282

Spoke to people staying in a villa there and they said they bought 'coupons' or something of the sort, and when all was said and done, they were paying about $20 a round.  They also agreed the course was crappy, and encouraged us to try Danzante.  Now, for a bit further of a drive - or a $40 US cab each way - go to Dazante Golf course.  It is a 35 minute drive from the plaza in Loreto, but lovely and interesting.  And only a bit more than Loreto Bay golf course in price.",10,1282

The room had a nice shower and air conditioning that worked well as well as Internet connecting through the bar/restaurant.  You are literally only a few footsteps from the center of town here - the literal town center or plaza where City Hall and city festivals occur.

Thank heavens we were able to leave quickly (although not soon enough to suit me).  The Angra proprietor was kind enough to let the four of us put our luggage in an available room...and this was even though it was only ten in the morning, way before check-in.  The rooms were large, clean and blissfully quiet as we had been treated to a pack of howling/barking dogs pretty much the entire night before.

In addition it is very near the bus terminal. Perfect if you don’t have a car. The buffet breakfast - coffee, cereal, and bread/toast, is a lovely touch.   If I was to be critical; it would be nice if eggs or pastries were on offer as well - just to make it a little more substantial. Sorry! Other than that - an excellent hotel. I would definitely stay again.",40,1284

If it had a refrigerator it would be perfect.  A precious time for us.,50,1284
Attractive but peculiar place. We checked in yesterday afternoon and we’re shown around by a pleasant young guy named Leo. This is the only staff person we have seen since. A place of the size that is clean must have people working on it constantly but we haven’t seen anyone. There’s a coffee pot here and I made my own coffee he seem to filtered water that’s available. But no milk or creamer and no one to ask about them. My room was smallish but everything worked and my bed was comfortable. I was in room five. The power went out in the middle of the night and came back on at 7:30 AM which leads me to believe they cut the power at night I presume to save energy. But if so they should’ve told us about that in advance. And again of course I can’t ask anyone because there is no one,30,1285

"We stayed here one night on the way to Cabo, and stayed another night on the way back to San Diego. Awesome room, it was big, clean, quiet. A small outdoor patio area where we cooked dinner and breakfast. We had our own camping gear. Air conditioning works great. Owner was pleasant.",50,1286
"Quiet neighborhood, midway between the malecon and city center, friendly and economical. It seems to be a favorite base for fishermen. It's off the main streets in a residential area with many fishermen in the neighborhood to provide advice.",40,1286
"I stayed here from 4/10/14 through 4/16/14.  I was a little leery at first, as the term ""RV Park"" had negative connotations in my mind.  I was in Loreto to go fishing with some friends, and the other place I had stayed at before, had no vacancy.    Claudia, the owner's daughter, was very friendly and accommodating.  We were given the rate of 350 pesos/night (~$29/night) even though it was high season.  The regular price was supposed to be 400 pesos/night (~$33/night).      The rooms are clean, odor free, have a/c units, have tv's, a coffee maker, individual bathrooms/sinks, and sturdy beds.  The rooms we were in even had an outdoor balcony area where one could play cards, drink, and just socialize.  There is free wi-fi, although the coverage could sometimes be spotty.  The 1st",40,1286
" floor ""red"" room (rooms don't have numbers, but are color coded) was close enough to the router to take care of all of my wi-fi needs.  There are no ironing boards/irons in the rooms, but I was there to fish, and didn't really have a need for that.  The rooms are spacious, have plenty of room to store your luggage out of the way, and have sufficient outlets to plug in a cell phone or laptop.  The shower had good water pressure, and hot water (not luke-warm like other places I've stayed at).  Mosquitoes did get in the room when I first arrived, but I bought/lit a mosquito coil, and they weren't an issue again.    This motel/rv park is about a 5 minute walk to the malecon (ocean front), and about a 7 minute walk to the town center area, and about a 15-20 minute walk to the El Pescador or Ley grocery stores.  I consider this place a GREAT DEAL for the budget traveler, and would DEFINITELY recommend this place to all!    I've stayed at Palmas Altas motel (closed down), Posada San Martin, El Moro Motel, and La Mision Hotel.  As far as ranking them, La Mision hotel is #1 but is definitely not for the budget traveler.  Many, many amenities, very new, and high end.  Right across from the malecon, but BIG BUCKS! #2 overall (#1 for budget) would be El Moro, #3 overall (#2 for budget) would be Posada San Martin, and Palmas Altas, appropriately enough, is no longer around.    Lastly, good cheap eats are: ""El Caloron"" - On the malecon, headed away from the marina, 2nd level.  They have and AWESOME view of the ocean, good margaritas, and great fish & shrimp tacos.  Another good spot to eat is ""El Sabor de Mexico"".  They have the best cabrila (type of fish) in town, and have good tacos, and lastly, ""Los Mandiles"" is another budget friendly spot with good food, wi-fi, and good prices.",10,1286

"we arrived late at night so we ended up here, it was the dirtiest, smelliest motel i have ever been to. the guy in charge was extremely rude and unpleasant. after 1 hour we decided to flee the place and never went back. what a horrible experience",20,1286
"The hotel itself is charming, as well as expensive.  If you are unfortunate to have a room on the third floor, it is 38 steps down and then 38 stops back up to your room.  (Beware - no elevator in the hotel.) We specifically asked not to have a room overlooking the plaza - but had corner room (#360 called Bougainvillaea Room) with two large corner windows over the plaza.  Very noisy.  Loud music all day long from across the street at a museum or something, or elsewhere in the plaza.  It is not the hotel itself that is noisy, it is the location.  Six days - not one hot shower, for me, although there can be hot water if you try in the morning.  Unfortunately, that isn't when I wish to shower!    Second morning I told girl in office the internet didn't work.  She said she would",10,1287
" look into it.  48 hours later - nothing.  I did my 76 steps to walk down and ask again - she replied that the manager would be in the following morning and I could come back and talk to him then.  Had also shared with her that there was no hot water in our room.  One would think the manager might have come up to our room to speak with us, but no, next morning, I did the 76 step ordeal again.  The manager said he would reboot the internet - it helped marginally for a short time.  We actually have to come downstairs to the lobby to get internet, and since this is a partial working holiday for us, we both have spent hours sitting in the lobby., to be able to get internet.  My husband was so fed up he just used his iphone as a hotspot and blew though data like crazy - an additional cost to us as we have had to buy more data for our phones.  Manager  - or whom I believe to be the manager - has not asked us once if internet or hot water issues had been resolved - this is after six days in this hotel.  No one seems to really worry too much about customer satisfaction.    Continental breakfast is marginal.  One would think they could change it up a bit - but it is the same one kind of jam, same loaf and croissants, same yogurt (although 2-3 varieties of flavor), tepid water for tea; like  a carrot loaves one day, lemon loaf another - something different to make it a bit more appealing day after day!  Drapes over large window don't pull easily to shut - get caught on the curtain road and barely covered the window.    A lightweigh'ish' fabric  so room got very light very early, and room got quite warm by midday - hence glad that actually something worked in the room - the AC.  The cleaning staff have been most pleasant.  We prefer not to have daily service, so whenever I ask them for fresh towels or whatever - they arrive with a smile and promptly.  The rooftop patio is lovely. Rooftop pool freezing.  Have not seen one person in it all week.    Won' be staying here again.  There are other lovely places nearby to stay that are close to restaurants and walking without all noise, with internet and presumably hot water, and a management team that seems to care about the happiness of their guests.!  The hotel and all that was lacking - including as someone else said - front staff pretty much 'unresponsive' -  certainly put a damper on our week in Loreto.",10,1287

"The hotel is a cute ""boutique"" hotel right on the Loreto town square.  It is a nice location, with many nice restaurants within a 5 minute walk, and just a few blocks to the Sea of Cortez.  We had a Junior Suite, which was spacious, but fairly starkly appointed.  It had windows that opened on the square, which could get very noisy at times (there are musicians on the square throughout the day and in the evening.  Our main complaint, which led to 3 stars instead of 4 is that it was quite cold in the room and, surprisingly, there was no heat!  We called down to the desk, and they have only A/C!  Apparently this is not uncommon in Loreto, but it was fairly uncomfortable.",50,1287
"Very unique facility.  100 plus years old.located on town plaza.  Too many stairs, small rooms. Limited hot water.  Loved it all.  Roof top pool, very cold, wading depth.  Continental breakfast included. Restaurants of many varieties nearby.",40,1287
"Several Years ago while visiting Loreto my wife and I decided we would return and stay at the Posada de las Flores Loreto. It met all our expectations. The room was incredible, the staff very helpful and the location excellent. The spacious room was very quiet and comfortable.  It was the type of room you enjoy just being in!",50,1287
"This place is absolutely Gorgeous and the room is charming beyond belief!! However a few things need attention. It’s fun to have an actual room key but the big wood key ring is cumbersome. There is no safe in the room. The Wi-Fi is terrible and the tv, while new could not get any reception. The phone in the room also didn’t work. The roof deck and pool are lovely but the pool is older. They only have continental breakfast and no bar or restaurant. That was missed for sure as we would have spent more money there.  It seems there used to be a bar at the front of the building at some point but it’s closed.  It’s right in town and there are lots of bars and restaurants close by.

Great location. Beautiful hotel. Clean. Quaint. We loved the feel of it. And they were very nice to help us park a long trailer in a gated and secure lot. I would definitely stay there again. Nice courtyard and awesome rooftop balcony too. Our room had a private balcony as well. Loved it.,50,1289
"I stayed at the Posada del Cortes in November 2021 before and after a kayak trip. It's a beautiful place in a great location, close to the main square in Loreto. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and went out of their way to help me with phone calls and arrangements. I would definitely stay there again - Loreto is well worth a visit.  One tip - if you want the continental breakfast, you might verify with the person at the desk at night to make sure they have your request. There's a very good place for breakfast - the Cafe Ole - just across the street: huevos rancheros, etc., and excellent coffee.",50,1289
"The hotel reminds me of great places that I stayed at in Florence, Italy.  This place is a real gem.  It's a couple of blocks from the mission, great restaurants and the bay.  I stayed in the summer so it's warm and humid and the air conditioning was quiet and more than adequate.  Great internet connection.  Friendly, helpful staff.  Rooms are elegant and upscale with everything I needed: workspace/desk, plenty of outlets, small refrigerator tucked out of the way, coffee maker, ironing board and iron, TV, and, as noted, a great internet connection.  Loreto is a delightful little town and this hotel complements the charms of Loreto, nicely.",50,1289
Was such a sweet stay right in heart of Loreto.   Wonderful service and super comfortable beds.   Fresh baked pastries delivered to our room and sweet rooftop patio.  We will stay again!! Thank You!  Stop at Mike’s Bar around the corner for a drink or take a massage at the spa in the square.  Quiet and beautiful hotel.  They are expanding with more rooms and a pool.. New favorite hotel in town. ,50,1289

"I spent 3 nights at Posada del Cortes. I found it to be charming, quiet and with real old time local character although impeccably well kept and up to date and clean. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Excellent choice. Located very close to the historic downtown, waterfront and many good restaurants. ",50,1289
"This review of Posada del Cortes is intended to make a traveler informed and make sure expectations are in line with reality. First the good, and there are plenty. The property is charming, well maintained and appointed on a relatively quiet street a few blocks from the Malecón and short walking distance from nearly everything. The rooms are clean and well appointed. There is Cable in each room with 150 channels and, not surprisingly, all Spanish except for CNN. 2 bottles of fresh water is left in the room every morning along with fresh towels. There is a rooftop with chairs to appreciate the surroundings. However, there was construction across the street and remodeling in the hotel which detracted from the ambience. We had a Queen Room that was about 10’x10’ and very tight on",30,1289
 space. The linens were more exfoliating tools than towels and the hot water was absent twice during a 4 day stay. The shower does not drain so you stand in 3” of water during a short shower. The room we were in on the first level in front had no ventilation at all. That made running a noisy air conditioner at night a must. The overhead light was apparently not grounded as it flickered all night creating a less than restful feeling. The staff is very nice and will help with typical Mexican hospitality. Something that is special in and of itself . That’s it. Hopefully objective enough for someone to get good information. ,40,1289

"A great place, but when you need to connect to the world, family, friends etc the wifi is the absolute worst I’ve ever experienced from a hotel in my life, a tweet can sometimes take 10 mins to load, and I’ve waited 40 mins to upload a simple 40 second video to Instagram. If the owners of the place paid a little more for some fast wifi (which is available as the local marina has it) this place would be 5/5 for me. Do it! “High speed internet my A”…",30,1290

Restaurant was good and margaritas were perfect after a long day of driving. The staff were very friendly and they have a security guard over night patrolling the parking. The room is spacious but outdated. The bed is comfortable, but definitely on the harder side. Bathroom could use major upgrades. Room could be spruced up with a few details like a tv, mini fridge, towels without stains.",40,1290

"We have enjoyed the restaurant here in the past. This is our first time staying in the hotel.

"We have been staying at Hotel Tripui two or three times a year for over twenty years.  The hotel experience has always been good and has been a good value for the price.  The restaurant has been very good for at least the last five years.  The pool area and landscaping is simply beautiful.  We have always had pets and the pet fees have always been reasonable.  This year, not so.  They almost bordered on the ridiculous.  The pet fee was 500 Mxn per pet of which we have two.  The room fee was $1,100 Mxn and the pet fee added another $1,000 Mxn.  To put this in perspective, most other Mexican hotels have a pet fee of $100 to $200 Mxn per room.  Not per pet!  Stay away from Room 108 in the summer.  It is the end room and the summer sun shines on two of the walls for the entire day. ",30,1290

It was quiet and relaxing.",50,1291
Just got back on the May 21st after staying for a week.  This was our second trip to the resort.  The other was last September.  It was nice to see the room expansion completed.  Our room was a studio on the six floor above the lobby.  Incredible view out to the bay.  Played golf twice.  Course is special.  Beautiful views everywhere.  Greens and fairways in perfect playing condition.  17th hole is incredible.  I won't try to describe just look at the attached picture.  The best way to go is all inclusive.  You are 40 minutes from the city of Loreto and transportation is expensive to go back and forth so no trips to town to eat.  Four restaurants to pick from plus the beach bar that serves tacos and skewers.  Ate there for dinner one night and multiple times for lunch.  Jorge,50,1291
" takes great care of you with both serving and making drinks.  You can walk out into the water forever and it only goes up to your waist.  Breakfast was always at the Market.  Buffet style.  We always sat in the section being served by Jesus, Jose Luis, and Cristian.  They were wonderful servers every day.  We enjoyed Oscar as our server at the pool.  One of the best I've ever had.  We ate dinner at the Market, Casa Club, and Casa Mia.  The Casa Club is at the golf course.  Slightly up the hill with beautiful sunset views.  Valentin was our waiter and the one of the best.  We had dinner 4 times at Casa Mia.  Valetin also worked there as well.  Tulio waited on us for a wonderful dinner one evening.  And the best bar tender ever is Cristian in Casa Mia.  We got to know Cristian during our last visit when he was the bar tender in the Market.  He remembered us and provided us the same wonderful service he did the last time we visited.  We ate at the bar twice with him being both bar tender and waiter.  Finally, my favorite bell captain is Uzeil.  He's the best.  Personally, the people here at the resort make this place so special.

There was a well maintained walking path to secluded coves with good water visibility for snorkeling.  On the path there was even a small cave with petroglyphs.
