Such a great hotel.  Wonderful service.  Friendly  staff.  Ideal location. A block from the main square.  Huge balcony.  Spectacular views. The concierge was so helpful arranging all our excursions and transportation.  Definitely would return.
"From the lobby, to the the room and then the pool, there is no place in this hotel that is not amazing.  The staff is helpful and very nice.  They go out of their way to make your stay great.  The grounds are lush and lively."
"Perhaps Loreto's most upscale hotel, with 4 star facilities, located just across the street from the malecon, with full views of the sea of Cortez.  We stayed at the Hotel Oasis, which is a 2/3 star accommodation about 500 yards south but right on the sand, which we preferred to the more upscale accommodation."
"Pros: We had an absolute lovely time here.  La Mision Hotel is a very nice option when visiting Loreto.  The staff are all very helpful and friendly.   Hotel is very clean.  Beds are wonderful.  Views are magnificent.  There is also a Starbucks in the lobby and they make wonderful coffees. The restaurant is great and if you have a catch, they are more than happy to cook it for you.  The chef made us a delicious ceviche and 3 styles of fish with wonderful dipping sauces, potato mash and veggies.  Rudy, at th"
 fridges should be standard in the rooms.  No access to a water machine nor water coolers are available to fill up your own water bottles.  We went to the market and bought our own water bottles.  Towels are a major deal.  We were a family of  3 in our room but they only supplied 2 bath towels a day and not enough face towels or hand towels.

This is a nice hotel in Loreto with views of the Sea of Cortez.  The staff is very friendly and very accommodating.  Would stay here again.  It is very clean and you can walk to the shopping and restaurants in town.
"Let me start by saying you will not find a more beautiful,outstanding hotel in Loreto than Hotel La Mision.This was our 2nd time staying here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.From the moment I made our reservation to the day we left we were treated with the upmost respect.We stayed on the third floor ocean view room and it was very nice and clean.I want to thank Angelica Yanez for setting up our champagne and cheese board in our room upon arrival and also all the wonderful staff that went above and beyo"
 applauded for making us feel at home during our stay.We had a wonderful romantic dinner the night of our anniversary thanks to Angelica for setting everything up for us it was very special and we thank the chef for an outstanding dinner he prepared for us thank you chef Ivan.So if you’re planning a trip to this beautiful town of Loreto don’t hesitate to book your stay at this beautiful hotel right on the malecon overlooking a beautiful ocean you will not regret it.We will definitely return as soon as we ca

"We had a really great time in las cabañas de Beny who was a really great host ! Beny is very kind and helpful, he gave us some pieces of advice when we arrived and was very friendly !! The cabañas are clean, well-decorated and eco-responsables (some materials are recycled). Plus, you can cook your own food in the kitchen inside the house. It was a wonderful experience ! We really enjoyed it and I would definitly recommand it !"
"Hotel básico pero súper limpio, lo único que el estacionamiento es pequeño pero el lugar es seguro.  Nos quedamos una noche pero satisfechos, sabanas y toallas en excelente estado. Comentaron que inaugurarán alberca en uno o dos meses no recuerdo bien"
"Cute hotel, nice vibe, clean and front desk very attentive. Visited in March 2022 and booked a 2 night stay to relax after a camping trip. The only downside was the pool. It isn’t climatized so on a windy & cold day the water was freezing and they don’t have a hot tub. Tried to cancel 1 night and it wasn’t possible as we’d already payed in full through a site."
"It is a small boutique hotel with well appointed rooms that are more than comfortable.  The rooms are very clean, the free breakfast offered is more than enough  in this cozy hotel. However in my opinion, what makes this hotel outstanding is the personalized customer service. I found the management very accommodating to all my requests. The location is also very good, close to the beach and the main plaza. I highly recommend this hotel for the casual traveler."
"The Rosarito Hotel is sweet and clean. The hosts Alejandro and Eduardo were very helpful and kind. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The water is on demand propane so it took me a moment to figure out, but we got it working!  A light made to order Breakfast is served by the pool in their courtyard.  It’s is super safe, as the desk attendant is 24 hours and there are two doors to enter before guest rooms.  It’s walking distance to everything in the town! The Plaza, the historic mission, the bank, the groc"
"This place was amazing, everything worked perfect, the sunset is a must, the people around very friendly. Pancho is the best host I’ve met. Everything was wonderful. The activities they helped us view went great. Will definitely come back."
"Hotel pequeño cerca del malecón y del centro (Iglesia, Palacio Municipal, Museo de las Misiones) cuenta con alberca, habitaciones cómodas, A/C y también incluye el desayuno. La atención por parte del personal es excelente."
"Incredible little gem in Loreto. Wake up to the sunrise outside your door. The bungalows are big as apartments with everything in the kitchen !  I keep coming back here for the location, the cleanliness, the safety and the staff. Gaby at the front desk is just lovely and so helpful !!"
"We came to this hotel on a Saturday night and found a great price and very nice accommodations. Since they don't have private parking, they offered to keep our motorcycle safe on their lobby area. That sealed the deal for us. The place is new, everything in the room smelled new and we had everything we needed. They do have a pool that looks very nice but we were unable to use it due to lack of time. Will definitely stay here again when we come back to Loreto."
This hotel is a very clean small boutique hotel. We were a group of 4 couples and had the hotel all to ourselves. The receptionist was great and helped us during our stay. The rooms are small but not cramped. They have AC and a fan that helped with the summer heat. We had to change rooms from the start because the air conditioner was not working properly. It is located a quick walk to Loreto's main town plaza and all the restaurants nearby. You can also walk to the marina. I would recommend this hotel for a
"We stayed here one night in a very cute bungalow that was in a great location across from the Malecon in Loreto.  Gaby, the manager, was very helpful before we even arrived, replying to emails promptly.  She even helped coordinate airline-required Covid testing for us there in the hotel lobby before our departure.  The rooms here are clean and we loved being able to easily walk to restaurants and attractions around Loreto.  We would gladly stay here again!"
"I can't recommend this place highly enough -- literally, everything about it was amazing.  Location -- stunning, right across from the Malecon (and with unrivaled views of the most spectacular sunrises I've ever witnessed).  Grounds...beautiful; every one of the structures has its own lovely outdoor space.  They clean and groom the grounds daily, and are continuing to make even the little improvements at every level.  And Gaby, the wonderful concierge, will go the extra mile to ensure your stay is a memorab"

"I spent a wonderful week in Loreto, staying in the lovely back casita at Sukasa Bungalows. The location of the whole property is unbeatable, in a more quiet part of the  malecon, right on the Sea of Cortez. Getting up 40 minutes before sunrise was well worth the effort. I was rewarded with the most spectacular multicolored skies right in front of the property! During the day, I enjoyed laying down on the lounge chairs or reading under the palapa. At mealtime, I was at walking distance from an array of excel"

…
"Best trip ever! The bungalows are super cute, clean, and had everything we needed for a 1 week vacation. And the staff were extremely nice, over the top helpful and attentive. She helped with dinner and spa reservations as well as set up several excursions for our family of 12. We saw dolphins, fin whale, turtle, caught 8 durados and snorkeling was off the hook! We are definitely going back to SuKasa!"
"A very nice place right in front of the sea. It´s one of the few accommodations in Loreto where the beach is less than 100 m away, so you only have to cross the street and the malecon and you can enjoy the sea and the amazing view.  We got an upgrade to a better room because the air-conditioning in our original room needed maintenance. The fact that this was offered on their initiative and at the same price, shows how much the staff cares about their customers. The staff was extremely nice, the rooms and ga"
"We spent 2 nights at the Hotel Taselotzin, one of our best experiences in Mexico. The hotel is located a 15-minute walk from the centre of Cuetzalan along very steep roads. Our rooms were simple but attractively decorated. The restaurant serves excellent and very reasonably-priced breakfasts and authentic local dinners. There's a shop selling hand-embroidered items, soaps and other products made by members of the cooperative that runs the hotel – almost a better choice that's available at the Sunday market,"
"For the money, Mexico has more to offer than any of the many countries I have been fortunate enough to behold. Cuetzalan is absolutely amazing.  It is a trip back in time, complete with cobblestone streets, quaint architecture, an amazing market, and a mountain vibe.  The Hotel Taselotzin is operated by an indigenous women's cooperative.  They offer many articles for sale which they make themselves, including clothing, woven baskets, herbal tinctures, soaps and salves, and more.  The rooms are CLEAN, clean "
" genuine, friendly, and professional.  They have a small restaurant there, where we took several meals; they were all authentic and served on native-made pottery.  These people and this place contributed immensely to my enjoyment of Cuetzalan.  Beware that it is extremely hilly and steep there, and this hotel is near the top.  We arrived at night and it was pitch dark, so I had no idea what to expect.  My apprehension was abated immediately once I saw the cute lobby and nice, comfortable room.  I felt compl"

"We loved Cuetzalan. The Sunday market is not to be missed. The street food during  the market was excellent. This is a small mountain town, so don’t expect a thriving night life. All the restaurants we visited, we enjoyed. Luna Azul isuare a very good one. The streets are stone and are steep. If you have any mobility issues this may not be the place for you. We wanted to do some off the grid hiking. We went to the tourist office in the square near the church and they called an English speaking guide. The gu"

…
"Rooms are clean. Staff are professional. It's a 15-minute walk to the downtown area. Also, they arrange for all sorts of activities around the area like horseback-riding, rappelling, and four-wheeling to waterfalls."
"This is a beautiful, while simple hotel.  The staff, who belong to an indigenous women's cooperative (great cause), are wonderful people who aim to please. Although the guest rooms do not have TVs, they usually have WiFi (unless you're there during a storm), and they offer a Temaxcal (sweat lodge) and sell handmade clothing and herbal medicines.  They have a restaurant on the premises, as well as a small bar.  They will also arrange for you to go on tours of the local area, including visits to the pyramids,"
"I really enjoyed my stay here. The rooms were nothing fancy but the beds were comfortable with lots of warm blankets. The shower didn't have tons of water pressure but it was relatively hot. We enjoyed the massages we got and also the meals we had in the restaurant (especially breakfast and the delicious coffee). Although it's a little bit of a hike up and down to the centro (you can also take a combi), it's worth it to be in this peaceful hotel. We did a tour with nearby Descubre Cuetzalan that was also lo"
"I’ve been fortunate enough to stay in some pretty nice hotels during our 1 month stay in Mexico, but the bed at this hotel would have to be the best so far - so much so, that it would take me a lot of effort to get out of it.  The staff at this hotel are AMAZING - the best service so far that we have received at any hotel! Special mention to Javier who always asked how we were going and if we needed anything, and to Elias who was so extremely helpful with EVERYTHING and always recommending great restaurants"

"Ysuri hotel has a great location in Sayulita, just across the street from the beach and the views are incredible. The rooms are very comfortable, with large spaces and a kitchenette.  Everyone here at the hotel is super kind and helpful making sure our time is well spent!!"
This is a wonderful hotel with excellent service and absolutely the perfect location in town. Beach front and around the corner from the village. Quite at night but walk anywhere. Clean as a 5 star hotel should be and the bed is soft view is amazing.
"The hotel and staff are incredible. So many amenities and everyone works so hard to make sure you are well taken care of. The hotel is in a perfect location, a short walk from the hustle and bustle of the plaza but quiet and feels secluded. The pool and cafe are fantastic and the recent addition of the beach bar is great. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone."
"Booked a garden room, thinking I would have a nice view. Instead my only window was what looked like construction. I was very disappointed in my view. Tried to get in contact with the manager regarding this. Every day I was told he would call me to make accommodations, yet he never did. Upon checking out, I expressed my dissappointment  that manager never called. Was told he would contact me that day or the next. Still never called. It would be nice if manager would put a little more effort into customer sa"
"This Hotel took care of all of our needs Covid tests, travel arrangements and events. The hotel rooms are gorgeous, the service impeccable and they did everything to make our stay enjoyable, comfortable and carefree. We would definitely stay here again Eli is a perfect concierge and Angel all of the staff were perfect."
We were in town for a wedding. We booked online and the room summary said we would have a garden view. Garden view was misleading to say the least. Service overall was good and the property is nice but see the picture attached
The location is fantastic with breathtaking views over the ocean. The hotel is also walking distance from many restaurants and bars. Our room was a delight. We had plenty of privacy and enjoyed several breakfasts taking in the majestic view from our balcony. Salomon is a superb host. I would highly recommend a visit to anyone!
"The hotel it's cute, clean the views are out of this world. We would like to thank the staff: Daniel from the snack bar, and Geovanny, from beach front restaurant. Excellent customer service. The check in was super fast and easy ( thank you Iris) We would definitely recommend this hotel who wants to visit Sayulita!!!"
"Zoa is a magical place perched atop a beautifully landscaped hillside with unobstructed ocean views &  big open skies. It's a serene spot for whale watching, stargazing, and decompressing. The hotel is secluded yet within walking distance to the beach towns of Mazunte and San Agustinillo.  This is the 2nd time my husband and I have stayed at Zoa in #5. We love the privacy and the surrounding gardens. Our room was always tidy with a fully stocked mini-bar and mezcal. When we weren't commandeering the poolsid"
" loungers.   Solomon, Paco, chef de cuisine, and everyone at Zoa are what make Zoa truly special and keep us returning. Their hospitality, attentiveness, and easy-going nature add to the chill factor, which is precisely what I crave when escaping daily life. The food at Zoa is some of the best on the Oaxacan coast. And when we wanted to eat elsewhere, Solomon recommended several great restaurants."
…
"Stunning hotel, with a beautiful pool set in landscaped gardens on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. It’s very well-located, in between two of the nicest beaches in this part of Oaxaca - Mazunte and San Agustinillo. Both are easily walkable (or swimmable, from the tiny little beach at the bottom of the hotel). The hotel is intimate with only a few bedrooms, which are large with beautiful views. The food and service were excellent, and the hotel is well-managed. We would definitely stay here again."
"Staying at Zoa hotel was a wonderful experience. The rooms have incredible views, the food amazing but it was really about the feeling you get while you are there. It’s hard to describe….They have created a magical space. The manager,Salomon,  and his staff are really incredible. You want for absolutely nothing! You are totally pampered and with only 7 casita’s, you feel like you are at your own private resort. We can’t say enough good things! Thank you to the entire staff for making our holiday so lovely!"
"NO beach access!! Room full of ants. Filthy swimming pool. Our room flooded.  The AC which is above the bed leaks so you are woken up by drops of water on your head… No pressure in the cold water in the shower. The fan in the room was inverted. The air got pulled up instead of blowing air in the room. Sadly, the manager Samuel never made an attempt to apologize or mend anything ( but the leak in the room) I must say that the food and employees are amazing!!"
If your like me and crave a slice of heaven when you travel for leisure then welcome to Zoa!   Beautiful property....amazing ATTENTIVE service and great food!   Our villa was cabana 1 and we love it ( we are still here debating the date of our next visit here.)  I actually live in Puerto Vallarta and I love living there so when I travel it must be exceptional and this has ticked all the boxes for me.  Zero complaints!   I love the layout. I love the thoughtful spaces located all throughout the property. I a

"I had the pleasure of staying here over NYE.  It is located just a half-block off of Hidalgo, the pedestrian walkway through Centro on Calle Abasolo.    The rooms are all kept Immaculately clean with daily maid service.  The towels, while slightly worn, were nice and soft (obviously they use fabric softener in their wash).  🤗  The rooms each have a safe ($10 key deposit) and flat screen TV with a few English channels.  Ceiling fans and standing fans are the norm, although a/c is available for an extra $200 "
" 3rd floor for a minute or two.  Small hotel bar soap and shampoo provided daily.   The music /noise from Hidalgo is certainly noticable, but was shut down by 10.30pm each night.  Complimentary coffee on the ground floor each morning.  🍵😋    Excellent location smack dab in the middle of el Centro Isla.  I would absolutely stay here again regardless of the time of year.  👍👍😃"
"We loved this spot for the amenities and close to all downtown. Close to bus route, bank and ferry. Maid service was fantastic and clean. We felt very safe! Our only issue we experienced was the bed! It was so soft we rolled into each other each night and woke up with sore backs. Otherwise a awesome spot to stay!! Just get a new mattress"

"Arrived here and the room was adequate. Nothing luxury but big and clean. The views from the patio/balcony where over the top. First night we couldn't get the TV to connect to Netflix. After hours of trying we decided to take a bath and go to bed. Oh no! No hot water. It's late by this time so cold shower it is for me. We contact the owner who sends someone out to help. By midnight, we had hot water. The next day, we find out we didn't have the remote to make the Netflix work and after that no problems. The"
"I am sorry to say we were very disappointed with our stay. The pictures showed a room set up which was very different, as we were on the split level floor which was extremely small. There was no shower water (only drips), it was quite far on a main road which then backed onto the sea (ie. your sea view is a road first) and management pictures showed the more premium larger rooms only for the booking we made. The bed was not king size as advertised, it was actually a large single bed and we will not be visit"
We stayed here for 2 weeks and loved it! Super clean room with air conditioning and a fridge. Located right off Hidalgo the location was perfect. For the price you just can't get better! And the staff was amazing 
"The staff was replying to my questions in a timely manner. The Booking was easy and the hostel is pretty close to the Ferry station when you come over from Cancun. Although, it was a bit difficult finding them at first glance because you have to walk up the stairs from the main street, so do not get stressed not finding them first- you will! :) (I could not see the entrance on Google as the main entrance is just between 2 streets not recognized by Google map) Check it was okay, paid upon arrival and I was s"

Be sure to get a room with a/c. Can’t imagine not having it! Walking distance to coffee, great food, shopping and the 3rd floor offers a view of the ocean. I’ll be back"
" do stay in hostels quite often and that is something important for me. - There was no separate locker but we could place our bags underneath the bed. Take your own locker to close your stuff because there is a hook on your locker door.   - My linen was clean and the separate shared dormitory bathroom was acceptable, although the bathtub was clocked a few times and ended up standing in the water.  - We had a small terrace area as well to hang our towels out. -Internet speed is fine, I could do my work well."

"We needed to escape the diesel filled streets of downtown Isla Mujeres, so we headed to the end of the island to find a quiet get away and stumbled upon Marias Kankin, Lilly greeted us with a welcome and a smile. We were not guest's at Marias, but enjoyed relaxing on the two lounge chairs within the restaurant area by the pool and had a wonderful time relaxing and enjoyed food and drink. After we relaxed Lilly showed us rooms 9 & 10, both very beautiful, we will be back to stay!!!"

We had booked just after Mexico went from COVID Orange (beaches closed) to COVID Yellow (beaches open with social distancing and masks required) so between the storm and COVID, it was an unusual visit.

The staff are so sweet, lovely and helpful. Highly recommended."

"Stayed here for 6 days with my partner in a private room with a fan and aircon. No concerns about the room, it was very large and cleaned daily.  Very much hostel vibes in the evening but during the day quiet as everyone goes to the beach together.  The staff were very helpful and accommodating. They tried to include you in activities. Some of the activities included pizza parties, DJ, magician, nights out as well as daily trips to the beach.  Beautiful 360 degree  view from the roof which I have included i"

"This place is one of the best hidden gems in the entire area! It used to be much cheaper but I'll continue to stay here as long as I go to the Cancun area. It's so close to the park where the iguanas are as big as florida gators and the nearby snorkeling is breathtaking! One tip...suck it up and get a golf cart for your stay, the cabs are reliable but it's nice to be on island time."
"We had a one bedroom apartment, it had everything we needed. Wake up to birds singing , nestled in a jungle like setting, walk to either side of the island within 3 minutes. There is a nice small quiet beach if you cross the road and take the trail down beside hotel la joya.sunrise happens just down the dirt road the opposite way. I would definitely stay here again, there are a few places to eat in walking distance like the joint , kin ha, just to name a few. The little smoothie stand on the main road is gr"
"Nestled on lovely grounds, these villas provide you with the basics for an extended stay on Isla Mujeres. They come with a kitchen, utensils, dining table, full-size refrigerator, stove and sink, bathroom and bedroom, all decorated as if it were your own apartment.  It is rustic, however. No air-conditioning (though two big fans - if you work them correctly, you’ll be fine even in heat) but you can take a dip in the pool. The outdoor areas will stay cool due to the foliage. It is also on the sleepy side of "

"My friend and I spent three night here.  We loved it.  Our Villa had a bathroom, living space, full kitchen and a bedroom with two beds.  There was a pool and nice grounds.  There was also a nice patio area we sat and enjoyed the evenings on.  It was close to a few restaurants and the beach."
"The house is exactly like on the pictures. Perfect for calm vacations out of city center.  The kittchens have everything necessary. Very green area, but take anti-mosckitos spray, because there are a lot of moskitos. Swimmimg pool is big and warm, good for kids.  Please, install air-conditionings and it will be just perfect place to stay, otherwise it is very very hot."
"A very super nice place, nice surroundings, nice swimming pool and very private and quiet . The owners are a very super nice couple and always at your service if you need anything. The best way to get around the island is to rent a golf cart and all the rental places are at the other end of the island so you can get a taxi to the downtown.  In islas Mujeres you can find all kind of restaurants and can tell you they are all really good and the seafood is to die for. In this village of Punta Sur you have your"
"We stayed in the one bedroom apartment on the second floor, with our 4 year old, over spring break. This is our second trip to Isla and we love renting a golf cart and staying in the south end. Last year we stayed at Mar y Sol, which is an awesome beach front location, but much smaller accommodations. Villas Punta Sur is set in a lush garden setting, with a lovely pool, and beautiful surroundings. It is very peaceful and there are many lovely birds! The apartment was spacious and clean. We were a little wor"
 returning in December with more family and can't wait to stay at Villas Punta Sur again!
"We stayed here for 3 nights. It was horrible. The location is beautiful, but that’s the only thing. We asked for extra towels , they kicked us out halfway because things were not going “smoothly”  We never had a proper check in. There was no guestbook. The airconditioning didn’t work so me and my boyfriend almost suffocated in the room. ( I will Put pictures underneath)  Instead of changing the rooms they wanted to kick us out ..  what else can I say ? I am very sad about this stay."
"El lugar es impecable , muy bien  ubicado , la playa está como a 40 metros , si van a Todos Santos recomiendo se queden en vista tortuga , un lugar muy cómodo , muy limpio , con excelente ubicación . Me encanto !!! "
Rooms are clean and staff were very helpful. The pool area is 10/10 and the highlight of the place. Location is pretty quiet but close to busier areas with great restaurants. Only issue was a leaky AC unit that soaked my clothes.

I booked directly through theie website, I was then told 2 weeks before arrival: ""To validate your reservation you have to make a 50% down payment"" which I decided not to make. They then charged my card regardless, I have an ongoing dispute with my bank, but have yet to be refunded or receive a reply to my emails 15 days ago"
"If you're looking for a romantic getaway away from the hustle, this is the place to go. The rooms have air conditioning and keeps you pleasantly cool throughout the night. When you step out of your room you see a beautiful pool nestled between the palm trees and jungle environment. There's also an area that overlooks the beautiful property where you can sit and enjoy the stars. I highly recommend this place and we're looking forward to coming back!"
"This is a great central location near the beach especially if this is your first trip to Tulum because the beach is more or less across the street (use the little alley across from Tunich) and you can bike to the town, ruins, or hotel zone in about 15 minutes. Gran Cenote is about 25 minutes by bike. And when you're tired or it's raining hard, you can eat and drink at Mateos next door (pricy but convenient).  This is not a fancy hotel by any means (it's called glamping for a reason), but both the jungle roo"

"I had a very pleasant experience checking in (Karla) and was given a garden room. Beach is well maintained. Room gorgeous boho vibe. But, the music vibrating my room from the DJ on the property is my killjoy. I came here to relax, rest and get sleep. The manager told me nothing can be done but gave me ear plugs. They do not work because the bass is vibrating my room which is on the 3rd floor. Sound travels up guys. Warn your guests please."
We stayed here for four nights.  The rooms are very tastefully decorated and very clean. The hotel is super central and restaurants/cafe/bars are all within a few minutes walking distance.  The staff is also so professional and helpful.    Tulum is a very noisy place- there is loud music pouring out of every bar and restaurant.  It didn’t help taht the hotel is located across from two hostels that host parties almost every night.  There was blaring music and yelling deep into the night.  If you’re a light s
"Casa Agape just exceeded our expectations! The accommodations were simply gorgeous. Spacious Suites with private garden backyard in Tulum town (very non touristy side of Tulum with very affordable prices). The location is walking distance to local shops, restaurants, and sites.

I absolutely loved this accommodations. In the center of the city and great food. Bar is great and the swimming pool is upstairs’ and you can see the city. Great service at the check in and at the restaurant. Go there. You won’t regret it. My sisters and I prefer Tulum rather than Cancun
"Food is modified Mexican and fresh, lime soup tasted like water. I ordered a cocktail drink which is well made. I am unhappy about the fact that they charged us 5 dollars per one distilled water. Service is good. We had ceviche, lime soup, and avocado salad and one cocktail drink which causes us 900 pesos. Plus service fee was mandatory."
"Stayed here for 3 nights for our honeymoon and hands down was the best part of our trip! The hotel is gorgeous and very relaxing and we loved the boutique vibe and fantastic service! The restaurants food and drinks were also phenomenal! Beds are super comfy and great location for walking to many bars, shops and restaurants!"
The food was good and the staff too! Very polite and helpful. The hostess lend me her jacket because I was cold <3 vegetarian options available. The hotel is also nice and the restaurant too. I recommend it if you want something relaxed and nice.
"This hotel is truly lovely. If you want to stay in town in Tulum, you can’t get better and the price is reasonable. the rooms are large and beautifully decorated. The views aren’t spectacular but that’s what you get in town. The rooftop area has a lovely restaurant. The pool area is nice but small. While functional, the pictures online are somewhat generous. The fact you can use the beach club is incredible and makes staying here such a perfect choice as you get the best of both worlds. If you want a sunbed"

"My husband and I stayed here while exploring Tulum. There were loads of restaurants within a 1 km walk; most of Tulum was close by.  The accommodation was a little rustic but absolutely charming. There was free drinking water, local cats, incredible food and coffee, and a really lovely pool. It was quiet and intimate. I especially loved how jungle-y it was inside, with tons of foliage and plants. My husband was a huge fan of the hammocks. Both of us found the wifi perfectly fine for what we needed (me downl"

"We loved our stay at Casa Don Diego. It’s a very cute spot tucked away in Tulum, but conveniently located a short walk from the bank, shops, & great spots to eat. The hotel itself had numerous little nooks & crannies to sit & enjoy the scenery of their gardens everywhere. In the center is a large dining area (their breakfasts & fresh juices were amazing), and there is a community kitchen off to the side with fridge, coffee pot, cook range, etc. Both our rooms had hammocks both inside & out on our little por"
The hotel is average but the wifi is simple terrible and the owners never did anything to fix it. I don recommend  staying there because of the owners they don’t mind there own business and are really rude.
We have stayed at Don Diego for many years as part of our scuba diving excursions to Xcalak. Charlie and Stefan continue to offer a unique boutique hotel experience in an unbelievably beautiful garden setting away from the crowded areas of Tulum. We love to sit by the pool and enjoy a margarita - no need to go anywhere else 🦋🌴🌺
"A French couple runs this place and they do a very good job. Rooms are nice and well equipped, there is a restaurant which has some very good food. The swimming pool offers you a nice cool down after a hot day. The restaurant is not close to the sea but just a short drive."
"Best place to stay in town !!! Nice staff, quiet and very clean rooms, wonderful breakfast  and a great pool to enjoy with the kids. We  highly recommend this place as it is also very close to town and all the interesting places"
"We’ve stayed at Don Diego two years in a row: October 2016 and 2017. We love this place, the food is great, the grounds are awesome, the staff is friendly, and the price is right. We live Tulum, we love Don Diego de la Selva and we will definitely be back. "
"Keep away from this hotel!  The main door in our room, had many big gaps, which means the door couldn’t close fully..! Room was full of mosquitoes! It’s a basic need that a room can be fully closed, The owner was so disrespectful and rude, he was not at all professional. We tried to ask for a new room, because of cause we didn’t want that, and I’m pregnant so I truly don’t want do sleep with mosquito spray on.

The beds are nice and there was good wifi and Hulu in the rooms.  The kitchen was fully stocked and even a bonus bottle of tequila left.  This was good since it was Sunday when we arrived and the stores don't sell alcohol on Sundays.  The only issue was the stove top did not work.

The pricing was very reasonable and will definitely stay here again. Make sure you ask for directions at gate because there’s about 6 different complexes and we had a hard time finding it. There’s no beach here but you have acces to the beach across the street at Bahia Principe Tulum where “salesmen” will try to sell you a timeshare and harass people throughout your visi"

"Do not stay here! Terrible customer service! There is no onsite front desk person! They lost my ID and refused to give me a refund for it. They also do not respond when you make a compliant! The hotel is located in an under construction area, where no excursion shuttles will pick you up. There is only one restaurant that will only serve you lunch and dinner. The pool is also very dirty and does not get cleaned!"
"We spent 5 days at Ma’xanab, and it was unbelievable. The attention to detail and focus on your comfort during the stay exceeded all expectations.  The design of the hotel welcomed you from the hot and humid jungle into the fresh breezy beach side. Patricio at the concierge desk was excellent at making sure all bookings and preparation was catered to in advance of our arrival. Jose down at the restaurant ensured we had everything we needed and would take the time to explain to us the rich culture of this Ma"
This place is unbelievable dishonest. They make book with a great price but don’t tell you that a 3 bedroom apartment with 5 beds is only for 2 people!!!!! Once you get there you have to pay $50 per each guest extra a night!!! The manager lives in Germany!!! No one to speak with! Only a lady at the front desk disrespectful didn’t care about anything 0 customer se one and super rude!!!! We decided to cancel our reservation (never check in) they never refund us!!!

"Worst hotel experience ever! On our last day of our stay, we got robbed in this hotel. Staff members stole a big amount of cash from our room just like that. When we asked for help, no one cared at all. There was no help provided what so ever. Watch out and don’t get fooled! Lock and hide everything, these people have no morals!"
" literally paradise, leaving was probably the hardest thing we did!"
"We stay at Central Park for 8 days and it was absolutely horrible experience! On out last day, the stuff stole our money, while we were at the reception.  When we reached out for help, nobody could solve anything and they refused us to check the cameras. The only person who was trying to help was Enrique, the receptionist.  We were not the only people that got robbed at this place.  Do NOT Book this hotel! It is NOT secured at all!!!"
"I've never stayed at a place with such a personal touch! I'm no camper or glamper but I will definitely come back to Casa Nawal. One of the main reasons, other than the fact that you're glamping in an air conditioned tent next to the ocean (hello), was the level of service and attentiveness.  Thought not crazy, I did reach out to make multiple requests and Peace was always quick to respond to make sure my wife and I were comfortable and satisfied with our stay. A truly magical experience in an awesome locat"

"This place is not like a hotel, more like apartments so don't expect a huge lobby/reception. Staff were friendly and pleasant to deal with. We stayed in one of the penthouses which was just beautiful, everything was ultra modern and new. The bed was super comfortable, many smart TVs to watch Netflix, the rooftop was nice to relax at. We didn't use the pool/spa/restaurant/gym (rock climbing wall) but they seem like good facilities and are there if you want them. We visited the Los Amigos Beach Club which was"
"Traveled here for a friends 40th birthday trip with a large group of people. Everything seemed fine at first, but started to notice certain things, such as not enough staff or security, not being allowed more than one key per room, the air conditioning units malfunctioning, and finally people's items going missing. While a majority of the staff was helpful and accommodating I don't think I'll be returning to Central Park after the previous experiences there."
"An amazing hotel on the best beach of Tulum. Simple, beautiful and full of life. The tent was ample, well decorated and comfortable. The property is a gem. Reminds me of Tulum as it was before it became popular. The magic continues at Casa Nawal. Paradise found! A 5 star stay."
"I wish we could give this place more than five stars. The room is stunning, amazing views, beautiful decor and great size. I was concerned that the plunge pool would be a bit of a gimmick but actually it was amazing and we used it multiple times a day to cool off or chill out.   The beach club is brilliant with a bed for every room and loads of space and great house music playing.   The best thing though is the staff who were so warm and friendly that they made us feel completely at home. No request was too"
"Forget about room service, how about robbed service? We had a group of about 45 people and booked 5 of the penthouses among a bunch of rooms. The service was terrible and several of us were robbed of our belongings including: IDs, credit cards, a laptop and a ton of cash. Then they tried to fine us for having glass in the pool, which is funny cause the waiters handed us glasses while we were in the pool... This place is terrible and I highly recommend you book elsewhere, the staff is very unfriendly. We lea"
"I would like to rate the hotel 5 stars, but due to misleading information about electricity and wifi I cannot in good faith. Casa Nawal is a beautiful spot with many great activities and wellness offerings on a clean section of beach. However, guests should be aware that they do not accurately represent the hotel online and are unapologetic about it. They advertise 24/7 electricity (a selling point because many other hotels advertise electricity cuts during  the day), as well as wifi. During my stay (August"
"Recently stayed at the Maxanab hotel and do not have enough great things to say about it. Their staff was attentive, no request was ever too much and everyone was so friendly. We stayed at the property for 4 nights. Rooms were clean, food and drinks were delicious and when asking for recommendations for activities or restaurants we were always provided with plenty of fantastic options. I highly recommend this hotel and supporting the wonderful staff who make it run smoothly."
"The guys who set this place up are developers and it shows. It LOOKS gorgeous. But... scratch the surface and it has zero substance. The service is basically non existent, like a serviced apartment at best, where you have to chase everything you ask for. We arrived 40 minutes ahead of check in. Room not ready so we got some food-300 pesos for 3 fish tacos (?!) then they said they would come get us when it was ready. They didn’t. 20 minutes after check in we asked... they said oh yes it’s ready. Took us to o"

It turned out that every other hotel and restaurant had wifi, so the original reply felt like it "
"A unique and very relaxing place to visit, Roberto at the beach club was amazing, kind and professional.   Fabiola from Front Desk gave us a very warm welcome and gave us an overview of the place, she is very kind and attentive!!  Food and drinks are great, as well as the music and ambience.   Amenities and facilities are top !!!!  Thank you everyone at Ma’Xanab Hotel, we had a great time !!!!"
" down, and we had to sleep sideways to avoid the hole this made. We told the staff when we left and they didn’t seem at all surprised, didn’t apologise, just said thanks for telling us. The things they offer in the inroom guide they don’t back up in real life. For example... everyone can’t use the bikes for free. They have no snorkels to borrow. They tried to rip us off overcharging 1000 pesos for a tour-we booked in town instead. Lovely facade, lovely pools, location was good (we enjoyed the walk to town a"

"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel in Tulum. The rooms are really nice, big and super clean.  Breakfast is simple and only 1 choice is included, if want more you have to pay. I would recommend to make a reservation without breakfast, there are a lot of other breakfast options outside/nearby.  The hotel also has a small swimming pool with some sunbeds. Also very clean. You can't really swim, but it's nice to cool off after a day exploring around Tulum.   The location is good to explore around Tulum by car (fre"
"We had a really amazing stay at Hotel Ma'xanab Tulum. Prior to our 3 nights here, we'd stayed at a nearby resort that was 40% more expensive and in the end we preferred the Ma'xanab.  I prefer a room with more natural light than the hut-style offers, but the room was nice. We especially loved the plunge pool on the balcony. It conveniently heated up to a warmer temp when the sunset daily which was a perfect and relaxing way to transition from beach time to dinner time.  I can't say enough about the staff. F"
All I can say is. The right people work here and the service is top notch. My family and I arrived around 8pm and found Casa Nawal easy. We then had a bite to eat at the bar where the service was 5 star. I mean they want to make sure you are happy with the food and drink. We stayed for 1 night only in the tent right by the beach.   Please remember you are sleeping in a tent in the tropics. But the environment and people that are there is worth. It’s all about being free and good energy. The dinner was great
 asleep. 
" Strong cocktails, music (not silence but also not a full on loud DJ scene), AMAZING pool, delicious food and again, amazing staff.  We will definitely be back to Hotel Ma'xanab and appreciate all of the wonderful people that made our stay so great!"
 area where if you don’t want to eat at the bar and you brought your own food you can eat there. They have a yoga area covered about 20 feet from the bar so if it rains you can still do yoga which is great because our last day it rained and people were under it. The main entrance where you check in then you walk pass other cabanas until you reach the beach for the tents. You can view more photos on my Instagram @TravelWithJSmallwood I highly recommend.

"The design and decor is awesome. I would describe it as modern, eclectic, innovative, clean, comfortable, unique.  The design alone is worth a visit.  I personally liked that the bathroom was sort of open, meaning you are afforded privacy - but you are almost outside since you have just 3 walls and a ceiling.  The bugs were not a problem.  But I could appreciate that some people might not like this set up.  I felt safe.  The hotel restaurant is charming and intimate.    I only take 1 star away for noise.  W"
"Our experience at casa Nawal was truly magical, totally immersed with nature and the uniqueness and charm of Tulum. Sleeping just steps away from the ocean under the light of the moon was amazing and swimming in the Caribbean waters watching the sunset over the Mayan Temple just made it an experience out of this world. The camp was a bit hard to find, look for Ikal hotel and walk the entrance all the way to the beach area, the Casa Nawal reception desk is a small table next to the Tikal restaurant bar. All "
"The good: the hotel is conveniently located, beautiful, the staff was friendly and it was immaculate. The bad: Although beautiful, with all the greenery, the courtyard is a haven for mosquitos.  I also did not like the locks on the room doors as they didn't make me feel safe and secure so I slept with a chair pushed up against the door (solo female traveler)."
We spent there 10 beautiful days! The place is located in the center of tulum in front of the Ado Station! The staff were really nice  and always ready to help! Maria and Lucia were really kind to us! The room was cleaned every day and the internet connection was really good! To make the long story short the perfect place to be! Thanks tulumena! Claudia.
" until the morning and the same issue, had to take a quick freezing cold shower but guess that is not much of a concern over the summer months."
Nice place with nice people. Good services. The room is huge with all what we need inside. The swimming pool is amazing. We rent a scooter in the hotel (they always have some disponibility). The restaurant is very nice with good quality food. Xperience is the place to be. Hope I can come again.
Great nice clean small boutique hotel in Tulum. Great location and amazing staff. Has a nice pool and located about 4 miles from the beach and strip restaurants. Lots of other restaurants within walking distance as well. Parking was available on site
"Wow. What a weekend. We came to Tulum to experience the culture, history, bars, restaurants etc. But we ended up staying at the hotel the entire time. The cocktails are spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, the service perfect. I have never been more content to sit and drink my poor liver to oblivion. After waking up from a heavy night and deciding to have breakfast and a coffee in their beautiful garden, we decided that this was all we needed to see in Tulum; this garden of Eden. Now 9 hours into our 3rd "
"From the moment you arrive, this feels like walking into a true tropical paradise and unlike any other hotel in the city. It is immaculate and massive with perfectly placed landscaping and a well kept pool with waterfall. The location is off the main path of the city so you can have a break from the loud endless party of the clubs of downtown, which is both a plus and minus for the time being. I'm sure the city will soon grow to encompass this in the heart of its' fast growing web. However, the people are w"

"The good:  Brand new property. Impeccably clean and well furnished. Convenient location, about 1 km to the „main strip“. Very courteous staff.  The bad:  Our bed was extremely soft and linens are really rough, starchy and uncomfy. Although the building is new, there’s very little sound proofing. Doors slam and squeak and you can hear your neighbours ... „talking“. During our stay (mid January 2021) there was loud construction in the early morning (6.00).

We stayed at Tulumena one night & were very impressed. We were checked in by the sweetest most welcoming young lady. It is a boutique hotel with amazing Bamboo accents. Charming artwork throughout & live music at the garden restaurant. If we knew this place was such a gem we would of booked longer. The water pressure was strong with a modern rain head. We also have a balcony that we love. The A/C is strong in the room & it is impeccably clean. We will will definitely be coming back & I highly recommend it.
Me and my partner absolutely loved his beautiful hotel. Its jungle inspired pool area with banana trees and a waterfall is just breathtaking.  The room was perfect sized with a fully equipped kitchen. We had a balcony with a jacuzzi with a view over the pool area. What a fantastic way to wake up to every morning and have a fresh cup of coffee out on the balcony.  The staff is super friendly and helpful 24/7.  There are plenty restaurants and bars within a walking distance from the hotel. Also local supermar

"We would highly recommend this hotel! Amazing pool area, staff is helpful and very pleasant. Our room design was totally perfect, we really liked this place! If we get back in Tulum - no questions where to stay! Thankful to the staff for all of that! :)  Greetings from Europe!"
"Almost perfect boutique hotel away from the garbage, trashy hotel zone.   We were robbed of $150 USD and hotel management didn't care.   Highly recommend staying here, however, be prepared for below average service for a 4 star hotel and, like us, you might be robbed"
"We were walking down the Avenida and came across this ahi Sha bar , it was an eye catcher but Don Rudy sold the whole experience to us , he’s an amazing waiter he’s on point and very conversational love it would definitely come back next time I’m in tulum"
"First of, my friend and I arrived in Cielo Maya last August 13, 2021, Friday around 7pm. We were welcomed by the afternoon shift front desk (male). I paid directly to him for the whole stay. I also bought a tour for the Paradise lagoon. The male front desk personnel did not explain everything well to us. He only brought our luggage upstairs without saying anything. Normally, a hotel would tell us the room number and the wifi password. He is very disorganized. When we went to the tour the driver was asking f"
We were walking along el centro on our way back from some cenotes to Playa. Unique location with a great vibe and full of shade despite all outdoor seating. The cochinita pibil burrito and shrimp ceviche Tulumeña were awesome! It's worth the stop
 tour company. With Cielo Maya nothing was explained. The waiters are always rushing to get my plate even if I am still eating and enjoying my food. They only had 2 customers and they were fast to pick up our plates. There was a 15% charge At the restaurant. I was a guest I should NOT be charged with the service charge. Tips are given from the kindness of someone’s heart. Last Wednesday August 18 there was a strong hurricane. The water went inside our hotel room. This hurricane was an unavoidable situation.

"The hotel staffs in this hotel are unbelievably disgusting!!! Not generous at all!!! They are very very poor in communication because they do not know how to explain their policies nor what to do when we booked an activity, they want to let the guests figure out - very poor assistance!!! All they know is to ask tips tips tips!!! Is this what you do when a pandemic crisis is going on, to take advantage of the customers!? Aside from that, the servers are so annoying and too fast to want to clean up our plates"
" no one helped. The guy said, there are no hospitals nor anybody to take care of my issue. In this scenario, how do you run a hotel without even having atleast a first aide!!??? If I had anaphylactic reaction, I can die in this place due to their lack of services!!! I just cannot comprehend what gives them the nerve not to care!!! No sympathy! No compassion! At the same time when this was happening, as I said, electricity went down due to the hurricane so it even made me and my friend more discomfort. We en"

"Pros: - Location and free parking outside. - Good wifi in the rooms - Comfortable beds and nice room. - The beach and the services - Most of the staff were friendly.  Cons: - We used the laundry service (which was good and quick), we paid by card and were told the payment declined so we used cash. Later we saw the charge in our bank app and when we told the staff, nobody paid much attention. It was just 6$ but it was an ugly detail (no, we didnt get it back)  - I was asked for a tip after our included break"
"We had the nicest single night stay at this hotel.  It is north of Tulum (so not on the crazy beach road) and adjacent to Casa Cenote (a common tourist attration).  The water there is calm and clean.  The rooms are stunning with big tubs, beautiful views, and all the simple luxuries (coffee maker, fridge, cozy bed).  Breakfast in the morning was delicious and they had a very nice menu to choose from.  The dock, the pool, the water equipment were all really nice additions to our stay. We would have stayed ma"
"Liked their place, clean and quiet, everything within a short distance.  Teams are very helpful and friendly. The  Waterfront is  gorgeous, private one, right at the rear entrance. Food is incredible, I’m planning to come here every time I go to Mexico.  "
"I travel to Tulum and I needed a place that was suitable for working and I found Selina Co working space, and it was a great option! . It offers you everything you need to get your work done, high speed wifi connection, good coffee, the most comfortable desks and private booths to go into your meetings. and a great quiet atmosphere, where you can also meet great people from all around the world. If you are looking for the best co working space in Tulum, go to Selina, im sure you are gonna have a great work "
"My girlfriends and I absolutely loved taking a girls' trip and staying at this hotel The location was awesome! They also have valet parking -Shoutout to Gabriel-!  All around I rate it a 10/10 for the view, location, breakfast, and quality of staff!"
"The hotel was a little tricky to find but once we got there everything was a breeze. The hotel staff (Nacho and Francisco) where amazing and so helpful, from renting scooters and ATV, organizing taxis and recommendations. They added us to WhatsApp and we texted with any questions with immediate response!  The hotel is new and a part is still under construction but it didn’t affect our stay. Rooms and big and modern. Only 5 min cab ride from the beach. All in all I was recommend. Especially since the staff m"
"My husband and I just returned from our second trip to Isla Mujeres and our second stay at Casa el Pio. I'm already ready to go back! Casa el Pio has cute rooms, a great little plunge pool, and a beautiful courtyard filled with amazing plants and trees. We started our mornings with coffee on the roof or in the courtyard (the coffee, by the way, is the real stuff, delicious and easy to make in the room), and the roof is also a great place to watch the sunset in the evening. The bed and pillows are very comfy"
"Wouldn't recommend. Value for money is completely unacceptable. Front desk staff was not at all helpful most of the time... Found a much much nicer place with clean pool, private room three times the size of the selina room, no noise, private barhroom, very friendly and helpful staff in a hotel nearby for half the price.  Must say, at Selina the food and restaurant staff were amazing (even though the prices were completely over the top). The tourguides from mayikalexperiences are amazing."
"Gorgeous Hotel, very affordable for Tulum standard,  has an adjacent Beach club (Vagalume), very beautiful property, u need a motorcycle or a Bike rental to get around town easier, will definitely be coming back!! "
 either.
"I was in Tulum for about a week visiting with friends and had previously booked at another nearby hotel, but found myself coming over to Selina and the Mia beach club every day! I eventually decided to switch hotels to join the group and it was the best decision I made.  When you first check-in the friendly Selina staff will store your luggage until your room is ready, and equip you with a bracelet which you'll use to enter the room and get discounts at Mia. The staff was extremely friendly and really made "
"The hotel itself is nice - it is modern, rooms are clean and well-designed. Plus, the non-management staff are nice and friendly. However, there are couple of things to be aware of: - The location is weird - it is neither close to the beach nor to the city center. It is impossible to take a walk or ride a bike to the beach or city, as the main road near the hotel is meant only for cars. - The management skills and attitude is extremely poor. They did not solve the robbery incident we had at the hotel room. "
…
" are modern and although the furniture and furnishings are extremely basic, they have everything you need for your stay.    The best part about staying at Selina is that it is adjacent to Mia, a really fun beach club and pool that you can hang out at during the day or party by at night. They have good food and drinks and you can relax at the day beds without a fee. Even if you have plans in Tulum the Mia beach party starts at around 7-8 so it's a great place to get your night started and enjoy good music / "
"This is becoming one of the best opciones in Tulum. Geat location! Les than 5 minutes to the beach but still in the middle of the jungle, surrounded by nature and that Tuluminati vibe.  Super friendly  staff. Amazing pool area. Highly recommended!"
"Casa El Pio is a very nice, small boutique hotel in a perfect location.  We particularly liked our room (Room 5), which is on the second floor and faces the Caribbean.  It was very spacious, the bed was comfortable and the view was superb.  They also have a nice rooftop deck - with a shaded canopy and nice lounge chairs.   Jose, the concierge, was a wonderful help, and the staff did an excellent job maintaining a clean space.  Will definitely be back!"

"Wow it’s hard to describe this property in words which don’t do it just it justice. The appeal of this property is that it’s off the beaten path which is ideal after a long day of adventures. The grounds are beautifully kept. The food is amazing! Make sure you try  local beer they carry, Minera, it is delicious. Abel, the general manager and his team do a fantastic job of delivering the best customer service and make you feel right at home. The pool and hot tubs are pristine. Easy access to nearby areas as "
I loved my stay at Casa el Pio.  Rooms are spacious and are decorated tastefully. The hotel have two different common areas and both are great. The roof terrace is a perfect place to watch the sunset.  A big plus in the room is the size of the fridge and the complimentary coffee  AND the quality of the pillows!!! Jose the manager is very helpful and will assist to get a golf cart or arrange any island activity.  I will for sure go back and stay at Casa el Pio.
Stayed at Hotelito Azul down from Selina’s but decided to spend the day enjoying the beautiful beach front grounds at Selina’s since the hotel i stayed did not clean the piles of seaweed on the ocean. Selina’s service and food on the beach was also exceptional. I would definitely recommend staying at Selina’s or at least hanging out for the day.
Hidden gem in the jungle. Such a gorgeous place and the service is always amazing! Beautiful place and amazing value! I have been there more than once this year and will continue to visit and recommend to any of my friends and family! 
"This place was an amazing stay, we keep coming back here whenever we stay at Isla Mujeres.  We most recently stayed for 4 nights in between Christmas and New Years. The entire staff including the owner, manager, and housekeepers are very friendly and helpful.  The room was in immaculate condition every day and the location cannot be beat.  There is an incredible taco cart at the corner where we got takeout and a Super Aki supermarket across the plaza where we got beers to enjoy on the roof deck.  We brought"
"I stayed at Selina for a week to ""work from home"" and enjoy some time. The Ocean view room was very loud. Selina is loud Thursday through Sunday and you'll need to be in the buildings away from the DJ stage. The location is excellent, right on the beach.   Breakfast at Mia was great every day. Service by Levi, Ricky, and Chego was outstanding. very great people.  Front desk was accommodating and friendly from Roberto (Posada Margarita), Camila, Alejandro, and Alfredo.  The entrance ladies were great too, Pr"
"We were so happy with our experience staying here! The decor is striking with the contemporary jungle vibes Tulum is known for, the staff goes out of their way to make sure you’re comfortable, and the location is perfect for getting to downtown or the beach depending on how you want to spend the day. Plus having Max the hotel’s dog keep us company made us feel even more at home. We can’t wait to return here whenever we can get back to Tulum!"
"My husband and I stayed at Casa El Pío for 6 nights while on Isla. I can’t say enough great things about this hotel. The rooms were so clean, bright, and airy. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept on when not at home! Coffee maker, fridge, water supply all were great! The roof top deck was perfect! We watched the sun rise up there. It was windy a few days during our stay, so my hubby grabbed some drinks from the store and we used the loungers for the day. It was perfect! The location is ideal! We"
"Pros: Included access to a great beach. Decent complimentary breakfast. Friendly staff. Plenty of nearby restaurants. They will store your luggage after check out,  Cons: Small room with shared bathroom was like a small humid college dorm room with a view to the wall. The above costs 200 dollars- there is no way I would pay 400 dollars for a private bathroom to stay here. Thin walls. Had to go to front desk to exchange towels. I ended up staying at two other nicer hotels the last two days but kept the room "
I stayed in tulum for a month and out of 3 places this is by the far the most amazing place I’ve ever lived. It’s BRAND NEW AND STUNNING!!! Right in the heart of the hotel zone 8 mins drive to everything beach related - 10 mins to downtown core. They have a shuttle for free that picks you up at 12 and drops off at 4 that takes you to vagalume beach club and you can walk to any beach club from there. They have room service and laundry service and a restaurant on site and bar by the pool and the hot tub upsta

"Just returned from five lovely nights and enjoyed our stay! Room was bright, white and contemporary...used the refrigerator and the water bottles. Loved in-room self serve coffee. Shower and bath were nice too. Appreciated the attention from housekeeping. The hotel feels so quaint and private—saw one guest once during our stay.   My only complaint—and hear me out on this: room number five faces the public road and it is noisy even without town celebrations. Each night, I heard at least 3-4 dogs bark and the"

Another was an Orange eagle creek bag small in size full of clothes, shorts, shorts, swim suits, things like that.

"COVID Visit Dec 2020  We stayed here during the middle leg of our trip throughout the Yucatan peninsula. We had rented a car and wanted to find a place that allowed us to park for free and had more of an apartment layout. Amaka was overall one of the best values we could find based on their location, reviews, and amenities. We booked through hotels.com and chose one of the rooms on the first floor which came with a small private plunge pool.  Upon arrival we found that it wasn’t far off the main road but ju"

"We had a great stay here.  Relaxing pool with hammocks, friendly attentive staff, comfortable large rooms.  The area where the hotel is located had a real international feel with a variety of restaurants and cantinas.  Would stay here again."
"First timers in Mexico! We stayed in Tulum and at this hotel for 4 days. The staff was really friendly and helpful with everything. We used the hotel bikes every day, and it took around 20-30 minutes to get to the beach! You can Aldo easily ride bikes to the Mayan ruins by yourself (you don’t need a guide) There Are located 10-15 restaurants just around the corner from the hotel, so you don’t have to go to the main street or back down to the beach area for breakfast/dinner. This hotel delivered as expected!"
"We stayed at Amaka for 6 nights in one of the apartments. The apartment was so spacious, in a beautiful setting. Bed was very comfy. During our stay the room was cleaned every day with fresh linen and towels, this made our stay even more pleasant. Loved sitting on the balcony as you feel really immersed in the jungle, great birdwatching spot, we saw toucans right in front of our window. We made great use of the kitchen for our breakfast, it comes with coffee maker, mini oven, microwave and blender, it was a"
"This is probably my 20th trip to Isla and by far my best.  Everything was so well curated and we felt so taken care of by Stephen and his amazing staff. They made us feel like they wanted us to enjoy every second of our stay, and went out of their way to make that happen. Check in was a breeze, the room (and most importantly the bed!) was very comfortable with spectacular patio views, breakfast every morning was amazing, the plunge pools are clean and refreshing, and the sunset happy hour was the highlight "
"This is a MUST STAY place. Everything was absolutely on point.  The rooms were beautifully decorated, clean and spacious. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning up sand dragged in form the beach and creating little towel figures to greet me at the end of the day. Breakfast was amazing- the kitchen staff do an incredible job preparing and presenting the dishes.  Happy hour was the most enjoyable- it actually facilitated strong friendships amongst a bunch of losers!! I highly recommend it. Margaritas, snacks, "
"Spent 9 days here & it was a great experience! Loved how beautiful and authentically decorated the place is, which makes it stand out from just a generic hotel. It also is out of town so more private but you can easily get to town with your golf cart rental in 5 min. The staff and owner are so friendly and helpful, and great to meet some very interesting people who are passing through. One could easily spend the whole time there if you wanted! as it has almost all the amenities you need. I stayed with a fri"

Either way, a visit there primes you for your visit to Mexico or it evens you out as you get ready to go back home.

"I spent 6 days at this hotel with a large group of friends. It was the perfect spot for a large group. The communal kitchen and all the social spaces were ideal for groups of people to spend time together. I loved the tiny private beach and the free use of kayaks and SUPs. I had one of the smaller rooms but it was just the right amount of space with a well-stocked kitchen to make coffee, reheat leftovers, mix drinks, etc. I used the industrial sized kitchen to cook bigger meals.  The hotel is conveniently l"
"As a first time visitor to Isla, Casa Sirena exceeded every expectation we had. Steve was a gracious   host that welcomed us into his B&B. The happy hour was a great way to mingle with guest and we enjoyed the roof top views. We stayed in room 6 and the view was amazing! Cannot say enough positive things about Casa Sirena."
 personal attention I received from the owner Eric and the manager Inga. I would definitely go back.
I would give Casa Sirena a sixth circle if possible. Steve the owner is a great host and bartender and is most welcoming . There is a huge free delicious breakfast every morning where you get to meet the other guests as well as a free happy hour on the roof every evening where again you can mingle with people from around the world. The location is perfect to get to everything and quiet. The entire staff at Casa Sirena goes out of their way to make every guest comfortable and happy. I  really like everything

"El Milagro is such a wonderful place to stay when on Isla. We have stayed here many times and enjoyed every room we have rented. this particular room (#2) was my absolute favorite with 2 private outdoor sitting areas, large bedroom with comfortable bed, and a large kitchen with full size appliances. We do alot of cooking so this apartment fit the bill. We ended up extending our stay for 8 more days as 2 weeks just isn't enough and Eric the owner gave us our last night free.

"Talk about being spoiled for a week!  Casa Sirena has thought of all the details and more.  Located on a quiet street, yet close to everything (seawall walking path, plaza, Hidalgo, restaurants).  Beautiful rooms, stellar patios, combined with a shaded courtyard to relax in the soaking pool, or up to the roof top for a few more rays, a drink, or 360 degree views.  Each day started with a relaxing breakfast prepared to your liking, go with a different special each day, or order up an omelet or egg sandwich, "

This hotel is great regarding location.  We spent the first part of our trip at a beachfront resort and the last 3 days at Naala. This hotel is beautiful and modern with a beautiful central garden and rooftop pool. Views of the jungle were great. The staff is pleasant and the food is amazing.  Close to Central Tulum and all the excursion meeting points. We will definitely stay here again.  There is construction going on next door but once in your room you don't hear a thing.

The buildings, the gardens, the views, the people - it really is an oasis in a hectic world! If you want an authentic experience, go stay there. If you want party and all inclusive, don't. But why would you go to Isla Mujeres for the latter?? That's not why you come here. At El Milagro, all the units have very nicely equipped kitchen facilities (and they a"

Not only is it beautifully decorated, it is kept spotless by the staff who seem to work around the clock and yet you never notice them as they go about their work and cleaning the rooms so discreetly. The waiters and bar staff are so attentive, we never had to go to the bar once as they are always coming over to attend to your every need and always with a smile and polite nature.

Drinks and food great abet expensive but that’s just tulum as we have discovered.   Rooms are beautiful and cleaned daily with added bonus of Netflix on tv!  Thank you staff for a excellent stay. 😃"
"It could be a nice hotel, but there is no control or service to monitor guests. People party in the room all night, security doesn’t care. If you love noise and sleepless nights and days this is the right place for you. Around lunchtime they bring a DJ on the roof until late at night and you’ll be forced to listen to techno music because you can hear everything. I will never return to this hotel and I do not recommend it. Definitely don’t come here if you are looking to relax."
"This place is in one word FANTASTIC! It’s so beautiful, the staff is super friendly and for my birthday they gave me a wonderful surprise in my room. Thank you so much! We are absolutely loving our stay here. The pool on the rooftop is stunning and the many seating options around it are the perfect way to spend your day relaxing in a beautiful setting. Breakfast is also great. Oh, and the bed is sooooo comfortable!! I could sleep for 12 hours in it :)"
"Me and my family stayed at the hotel but we got robbed. They stoled my father’s wedding ring and they did not do anything about it. I don’t recommend the hotel at all, a happy family trip turned into a bad and sad experience.

"Before choosing to stay at Hotel Muare we read the reviews and viewed the images of this picturesque hotel . It seemed perfect ..  away from the hotel area, small intimate boutique style, sorrounded by nature , a spa , pool w day beads , restaurant and bar , who needs more .  As soon as we walked in it was picturesque perfect.  Exactly like the pictures we had seen.  We were greeted w smiles and friendly faces.       Praise must be given where its deserved Nydia and Fili were phenomenal! Their attention to "
"If your searching got you this far STOP LOOKING! You have found the perfect place. Best property in Tulum, hands down. From the road you can't see what lies behind the gate but when it opens (almost by magic by the always present and always unobtrusive security guards) and you walk in, it will take your breath away. Incredible beauty in every direction. The three separate buildings form a compound of interconnected pathways leading  to dipping pools and rooftop decks, amazing suites and shaded lounge areas,"
"The breakfasts were fantastic! Our host, Juan, was incredible. He was generous and super helpful. He also gave us great recommendations for activities/food. Every recommendation was amazing. Honestly, our vacation wouldn't have been near as great without Juan's help and staying at La Selva Mariposa. I have already recommended this place to friends. It is beautiful, comfortable, and enchanting. And, you get to listen to the sounds of the jungle while falling asleep!"

"Please note we paid $196 Canadian  Dollars a night for this place ($154 USD). Figured to save some money on restaurants as it came with a kitchen. ARRIVING: The hotel is situated on a 9 kilometre stretch  of road littered with hotels, restos, bars,boutiques, tourist traps, other junk, and horrendous bumper to bumper traffic ( cars, buses, taxis, scooters—think of Manhattan cross-town traffic, only worse.) Given that Suites Tulum is located behind a bar and they don’t have the decency to have a sign or any o"

I understand we are surrounded by nature but we didn't expect to find them throughout the night as we were woken up by them .  After this we started noticing many things the hotel was falling short on . For example .. very small detail.  Yet impressions matter .. our room's Reed diffuser was empty , there are small gaps in the rocks for"
 Best vacation ever! 
"La Selva Mariposa is a lovely paradise tucked away in the jungle just outside Tulum. The property is artfully laid out with private and semi-private bungalows among several pools and water features.   We found the rooms cozy and comfortable, each one a work of art. Breakfast each morning was fresh and delicious, the staff were friendly and helpful, and Juan took exceptional care of us during our stay.  We found the property to be a great location for getting to all of the sites.  We ventured to Coba, Vallad"
" directions had been texted on the date of our arrival. Didn’t see them. I have a funny habit. I don’t read text messages when driving. THE ROOM: The word “plain “ comes to mind to describe it. Also “ total lack of charm”. The kitchen was minimalist. For example, no cooking utensils, frying pan, or dish towels. For our clothes, 2 minuscule shelves (like really, really tiny) and 3 hangars. The lighting can best be described as perpetual obscurity. We did have a patio— 2 cheap, uncomfortable chairs and a very"

I had the pleasure to stay at this newly designed hotel in April. The whole place Oozes with style.  Well done to the architect for such a well planned layout of the grounds. The room I stayed in was stunning. Lovely comfy bed. Dreamy drapes & sofa. With a private jungle garden and plunge pool. Fell asleep in the hammock one day. Loved the outdoor shower and organic products. Moody lighting. Perhaps more light in the bathroom area. Appreciated the full length mirror. Wi-Fi worked well.   I enjoyed relaxing

Tucked away in a village on the road between Tullum and Coba - a quiet retreat. Juan looked after us very well and helped us get to Coba to explore the ruins and onwards to Tullum after our stay. Great fresh breakfast served outside in a quiet area in the jungle complex. It even has a cenote on site - though not one you would swim in - but can gaze down into. jungle noises and frogs to accompany your evenings and a great Italian restaurant a short walk through the village - he makes his own pasta.

 definitely try to make this dish when I get home.  Dinner was superb. Loved the fish dishes.  I could sit there for ages listening to the excellent thought out music playlist.  All staff without exception were amazing & super friendly. From arrival to departure. The service was kind and attentive.   Thank you for a memorable stay. Hope to return again soon.
The villa is beautiful and the staff is just absolutely wonderful! Leo and Cindy went above and beyond during our stay to ensure we were taken care of. Definitely recommended and will come back again.
"La Selva Mariposa is the perfect base to explore Tulum, Coba and all of the beautiful surrounds. Everything is a short distance away, and you get to enjoy the tranquility of the jungle without the constant hum of tourists in the hotel zone. Juan and the staff are ready with wonderful recommendations for food, cenotes and ruins. We had delicious breakfasts every morning and were even able to cook ourselves dinner for the first time in a month thanks to Juan’s generosity.  The room was beautiful with lots of "
"This was our second stay in Suites Tulum in 2 years. The place has now been renovated and they have added new rooms and a rooftop with a small pool and really amazing views, 360 degrees you can see the jungle and the sea. We got one of the new rooms and it was cozy and nicely decorated. The beach is still as beautiful as it was 2 years ago and you are right across the street from it, just 2 minutes walk."

Please tell me why I would need to reconfirm a trip that I already paid for and confirmed several times?

"We decided to stay here at LSM because we wanted to be close to the cenotes and ruins. I found this little charm here on TA and decided to get it a try. Let me first start off by saying it's not your typical hotel (b&b). Its placed out in the jungle and a little hard to find since it's not off the road. The room was so charming and had an authentic Mexico feel to it, with the shower being exposed to the outdoors, oh man was it beautiful. The staff here are really nice and the breakfast was delicious. Howeve"

"Orchid House Tulum is a five star facility located in a new built-up area of Tulum, a 10’ drive away from the city centre.  The positive aspects of this facility include its aesthetic beauty, with a unique, Gaudi-like architecture, an amazing bar&pool area, beautiful rooms with large comfortable beds and a good ratio price& quality. Unfortunately, the negative aspects well-exceed the positive ones: in a five-star hotel one should never find stained bed linen, dirty bath robes (mine had clearly been used bef"
…
" the setting in a green area.  We tried the food and a number of cocktails and were not particularly impressed, so I would not recommend having dinner here.  Lastly, what differentiates a five-star hotel is service, which is practically absent at Orchid House, with the staff at the desk being unprofessional and unfriendly. All in all, our impression was that this hotel is truly beautiful aesthetically, but plenty of work is still needed in terms of maintenance and service."
"I never write reviews but I had a great experience here and I felt it needed to be shared. There was a post about this place being a shipping container, and it’s just not the case. It’s very nice. Not glamorous but it’s Tulum, if yon stay on the beach you might not even have electricity at night.   LGBT-friendly hotel catering to young adults more so than family vacations, with lots of Solomun / Black Coffee-type of music at happy hour in the evening at a bar right next to a large unheated pool.  It’s not h"

"We loved staying at Orchid house, the staff was very friendly and welcoming. They were able to help us get around and to get to know the area. The architecture and items are eco friendly and it’s embedded in lots of nature, which made me feel like I was in the heart of a jungle.  I would definitely come back to this beautiful boutique hotel and recommend it to everyone!"
" kinder,  the pool is gorgeous and the rooms are as nice as advertised.  Pro tip upgrade to the XL room for a fridge and a microwave if that’s your thing,   The location is on the main strip, a two minute ride from the center of downtown Tulum. Great value. Would have liked softer mattress, but i can deal."
"I have held off on this review for months, but I feel like my fellow travelers should be made aware of what happened during our stay at the Orchid House.  First, I do want to point out the good – the food was really good (continental breakfast, a la carte breakfast, and their tacos).  Drinks were also really good.  We loved the rooftop plunge pool, as well as the room size.  The bug repellant in the room was a very nice touch.  We were a total of 3 females, and we had 2 suites with plunge pools (1st floor) "
It was mi first time in Ikal. The service at the restaurant was really good! I loved margaritas and tacos. Abraham make a really good work attending me! I have a great time! I would like come back soon with my friends.

When we returned late afternoon to get ready to visit the ruins, they informed us of an additional $150+ charge due to makeup on the towels, sheets and facecloths.  We were confused because we were only aware of 2 facecloths with makeup on them. They said they did not have a washer or dryer on site, and they have to send everything to the cleaners.

"Amazing from the moment I made my reservation, their online concierge took care of absolutely everything I needed for my family to spend an amazing holiday in Tulum, this is by far the most relaxing place in the area, the vibe of every single person here is just right, all servers and employees have the right set of values and understanding of the guests in the kindest level.   You feel like in a village, a community way more than you feel in a hotel, it is absolutely peaceful and private and I'm definitely"
The Hotel itself is nice and the staff friendly. The rooms are clean and of reasonable size. But they're stripped down to the bare minimum which means there isn't even a proper place or hook to hang a towel or wet swimming trunks. The walls are quite thin as well so you can really hear if some people are coming bsck late at night. We felt quite safe at the place since there is a security guard and everything's locked. Staff is super helpful as well and we loved the owners dog Bruno.
"This place is magical. If you want to be in a peaceful place, but at the same time close to the attractions on Tulum, Orchid House is the best option. Everyone in the hotel was very nice and professional. Our room was clean, and very well equipped. Food was delicious. We had dinner at the nest, during the sunset and It was a dream. The customer service was amazing, everyone at the hotel is very kind and available to help. We definitely want to go back!!!"
"The place is incredible: architecture of the hut, view from its terrace above the jungle (perch), small private garden, outside bathroom; suspended and comfortable bed at 2mn from the beach.  The service is horrrendous from beginning to end: from check in to the restaurant. The only smiling person was a young man at the reception (Nicky?) who did his best and was systematically ignored by the others. No possibility to have breakfast in his room. We waited 45mn for a coffee and chocolate pancakes or should I"
"The hotel is built out of metal shipping containers. Great concept for recycling but there's a reason why hotels and houses are NOT built using shipping containers. They do not breath, and traps all the moisture inside. This is construction 101. We went into the room and it was full of mold spores, so bad we were coughing so bad.  So we cancelled the hotel, and left. They refuse to refund the charges and charged our credit card anyways.  We've called several times and no response!!!!  and the rooms were soo"

The six course meal was delicious and filling. The staff was so accommodating they even brought us a speaker to play our music. WorthEvery penny. Definitely a new hidden gem in Tulum. I visited as a week as well in April 2021 and their customer service was terrible and overpriced. Azulik had an attitude as if my black usd was worth less"
Avoid at All cost!! This is a warning to anyone considering staying at this hotel. this hotel is run by unscrupulous people who will do everything possible to steal your money. If there only use cash.  Read the multiple reviews on all travel pages. Tulum and Mexico are beautiful. I can’t believe they’re still in business after all the bad reviews and experiences.  Please save yourself the bad moment. There are multi olé great hotels on that same location.   Specially avoid it for single women or families wi

"Stayed here for 5 nights and had a quite unpleasant experience. What seemed to be the ideal getaway for grown up travelers looking for some quiet turned out to be a place where groups of Instagram-obsessed youngsters go to hang before going to parties and crash after parties. The noise level was entirely unbearable. Add to this the paper thin walls and the incredibly noisy piping that creaks all night long and forget about sleeping. Laughter, loud music, slammed doors all day and night, and the hotel is not"

After two days of no internet and not being able to use the TV and hearing several other hotel guests complain of the same issues we asked if we could be let out of our reservation.

We spoke with management and they were to refund us within 10-12 business days.  We were happy to find a resolut

It was 90 degrees and the air conditioner didn't work. I got bit by a million ants that were on the bedside. We ended up leaving the property after 2 nights because it was supposed to be a relaxing vacation but there was nothing relaxing about no AC and bug bites.

"I spent 6 nights in Barro Negro with my girlfriend and we just loved it. The staff is really friendly and helpful with everything we needed (including tour tips). The rooms are clean, modern and the environment around is really calm and peaceful.  The hotel is a 5min drive from Tulum centre and 10min from the main public beaches, which is really convenient.  They do not serve breakfast but you can get a tea or coffee at any time. They also let you put your drinks and food in their fridge.  Highly recommend!"

"Great experience! The staff was really helpful. Whenever I would call they would help us out. the servers at the restaurant were amazing.   The location of the hotel is perfect. It’s quiet at night, and it’s not too far from the centro or other hotels. And the beach is right next to the restaurant. And our room had A/C which was perfect. Loved everything about this place."
"We stayed here over March break thinking we were getting a really good deal for the beach area but you definitely get what you pay for. Food was really bad,  Pool not taken care of (it was falling apart). The jets weren’t even kept on. And there was a night club that was blasting music all night.

Overall, Tulum is no place for children (lesson learned), but this was ridiculous.  We didn't eat at the restaurant, didn't even stop in for our 'free' breakfast. Didn't look inviting.  The WORST part of it came at the end. We told everyone we had an"

The room was continually damp from the humidity of the jungle setting - towels didn't dry out, black mould grew in the bathroom and the bedding felt damp to sleep in, most unpleasant.  Housekeeping was hit and miss, for two days the room wasn't serviced at all, sometimes you'd get fresh towels or toil"

The onsite restaurant is fantastic so I recommend visiting just for that before quickly retreating to a cheaper, better hotel."

Came to tulum with some girlfriends for a bachelorette party and the rooftop bar was recommended for a drink. The bar is beautiful and the service was excellent. I really enjoyed my margarita and my friends drinks were all delicious.
Sergio is just fabulous. Beautiful hotel and both the rooftop and pool are really impressive. An idyllic oasis in midst of bustling Tulum. Perfect place for a pre dinner drink. The decor is really cool!
"We checked into a room that was smelly, with no AC, dirty towels, and roaches in the shower. We went to the restaurant for dinner and felt we were bothering the server who was extremely rude. We could not sleep the first night due to the excruciating heat and heavy noise coming from the next-door venues. The next day, we asked the front desk person to change our room but were told that nothing was available (although we saw other people checking out). Finally decided to check out because of all of the above"
"Lovely rooftop bar. Fabulous drinks, excellent service.  Passion Fruit margarita is a must. Sergio Is a excellent server and very attentive. Nice breeze, boho vibes and great music. Sangria was excellent and great spot for cocktails. Coming back for food!"
"We stayed for a few day, we loved the food, the service and the parties in the rooftop. We didn’t want to leave :( . A special thanks to the staff who were wonderful but a extra special thanks to Vanessa in reception who was always so kind and funny. We recommend."
"We enjoyed every minute. Jasmin and the rest of the team were very nice. Food was excellent. Not all rooms have a separate Toilett, you could smell the canalisation. Other than it was clean. No A/C in our room but a fan.  Free parking is available as well."
"Only visites the rooftop bar. Great location and good music, but the worst cocktails we ever had. Very sour, poor taste. Mine had some herbs on top, but they had no straw. So how do you drink this? They poored it into a new glass for me. Probably stick to Beets here. "
We spent 14 days at Su casa and had a great time. At first we had the apartment 1. The apartment 1 was not so nice. It is next to the street and you can smell and hear the cars. The bed was too small for us. After one night we upgraded to a beachfront apartment. This was the best decision we could make! We stayed in apartment 6 with an amazing view. You can see the beach and the sea without any people (most oft the time).  The cottages are nothing special but they are clean and provide everything you need. 
"My husband and I spent a little over a month in Tulum. We absolutely loved the Zulum beach hang out! Low key vibes, the music is enjoyable, and the view amazing! Waitresses Tania, and Jasmine, are absolutely spot-on to your every need! It’s by far our favorite go-to beach day destination!  We will definitely be returning!"
"Very nice and cozy hotel with relaxing atmosphere. Perfect location for going out to bars and restaurants in downtown Tulum or to rent a bike and go to the beach. Really amicable staff. Special thanks to Vanessa at the reception desk, who was very friendly and helpful, her smile and positive attitude make this place even better :)"
" where you can get new towels, linen, toilet paper and soap. It is just steps away and you can decide on your own if you need more towels.  When you like a quiet place, to be alone and enjoy you beer without loud music and drunken people this is the right place for you!"
They have two horses and a donkey in the backyard and all are in terrible condition.  The animals have no water and food and look sick. Tried to talk to a staff member but they did not care. Devastating :(
"I had an amazing dinner at the hotel’s rooftop restaurant. The staff was super welcoming, professional and friendly. The food was incredible. Highly recommend! Also great location in the heart of Tulum. The building and interior spaces are beautiful. Really well done!"

We are currently at the hotel. It’s midnight and the music and bass from the club next door is literally shaking the walls. There is no way we can sleep or even think. Deeply regret booking here. The receptionist knew fully well that this music was going to be this loud at night time - it was playing during the day (which we weren’t too worried about as we were going to be out during the day) but she did not tell us it would go into the night.   There is no way this place should charge for rooms. I would no
"Beautiful hotel, but the rooms are not very clean, the loud music from the upper level bar is non-stop making it nearly impossible to rest, and the staff is unaccommodating and rude. Checked out a day early. Never again!"
"Wonderful hotel, wonderful staff, wonderful vibes. I was only here for two days but now wish I had planned longer. The rooms are very comfortable too and the location is really handy. If you have time to spend in Tulum this is a great place to stay!"
"This was my second time coming to Su Casa & I love it here. We were 4 couples & rented 4 cottages.  They are nothing fancy, but I love that they have their own private beach & no kids.  The cottages have little kitchenettes, so we could make breakfast & sandwiches for lunch.  There is also, a coal grill on the beach, so we had a couple BBQ's. The only thing that really bothers me, is that the linens are old & beat and there is no housekeeping.  Even if someone came to empty rubbish, change towels & bring to"
I loved my stay a Hotel Zulum… it had a great friendly chill vide which I really enjoyed. The location was amazing! Walking distance to pretty very thing you want to do in the beach area and a short bike ride into town. The price is great when compared to the surrounding hotels. The restaurant on site was very good and affordable. No A/C in the room I stayed in but fans are provided for you. It’s a little loud from the near by beach clubs but nothing that really bothered me. Everyone there is super friendly
"Amazing hotel to stay at. The architecture is insanely gorgeous. The decor is lovely. The rooftop bar is gorgeous as well. The pools are nice and clean. Super service. Friendly staff. Located directly downtown tulum, close to everything you might need. Would definitely go back there!!!"
"Our favorite spot on earth, visited several times. Romantic, private, amenities like a/c, wifi (in room!!) kitchen, amazing beach club a few feet away etc. You will not find a better place for your money in the world. Lupita, Marcus and family are a delight. Devastated to learn the lot is for sale and will likely be destroyed once purchased. Go while you can, it is a gem.

We went there as 2x families for 6 nights, we were so desperate we run away after 1 night with a dare of losing all our  money 3,000 $. After talking to the manager we got a feedback its a rustic hotel ! LOL! If you dont want to ruin your holidays stay away!"
" $12 that only added to the ambiance of the room, while keeping mosquitos out while asleep.  3. Purchase charcoal and lighter fluid at Chedraui (on the island, don't shop on Cancun and try to bring stuff over) There is a grill on site 4. Rent a golf cart. No really, just do it.   "
"Friendly owners and staff.  Right on the beach.  Most affordable place that is on the beach.  The owners (husband and wife) are the nicest, most chill people with a beautiful family.   Will most likely stay there again later this year.  "

"My boyfriend and I took a golf cart around Isla Mujeres in the hopes of realising an affordable six week stay.  We found the Su Casa board just outside their pretty front garden with a huge Banyan tree - they have two in fact… From the office, Lupita showed us around and we were awestruck by the beach: a wide and long expanse of soft sand and gentle water with beautiful palm trees.  The pine trees sweep around back patios providing shade and and birds that sing throughout the day. There can’t be many beache"
"Zulum was a super cute boutique hotel. They had more parking than I expected. The room was clean and big. The concept of ""hanging furniture"" was interesting (the bed and clothes rack hung from the ceiling). We appreciated being given a big jug of water each day. The bathroom was really nice with its stone work as well. The staff were friendly and very helpful (e.g., offered to bring us a second fan if we were too hot). The pool was freezing but it looked nice and we would have used it more if we couldn't ha"

There’s a chic beach club next door called Zama, where you can sit at the bar (my favourite: fresh chilli mohito) and eat affordable, freshly cooked local dishes.

They have an cute pet that roams free but no more plot spoilers…  For your own supplies, try ‘Chedraui’ for excellent tomatoes, papayas, avocados and all else you can stock up on, including some great beachw"

"We stayed at O’Tulum for three nights. It was by far one of our favorite places in Mexico. A small quaint boutique resort with rustic chic vibes. The resort is tucked in the interiors with a 10 min tires ride on an unpaved path with a little paradise of a beach resort at the far end of the road. The staff is splendid who pays attention to the smallest details. From the reception, to the housekeeping staff to a fantastic restaurant staff- their seller is empathy and attention to detail.

 resort is not ideal for swimming as it is rocky. But there is a beautiful beach at a 7 mins walk great for swimming. The resort also is a 5 minutes walk from Casa Cenote. The internet connection is certainly a little patchy but isn’t that the point of taking a vacation. Where you are compelled to switch off and enjoy what s in front of you! :)
"We have been to the Isla several times but this place is a piece of paradise...You walk in and it has a jungle feel to it. The walkway to the house is beautiful and so green, and the house is so nice and clean.  They had the A/C already on so the house wouldn't be hot.   The view from the balcony is amazing, and laying in the hammock was so relaxing.  You can also see the turtles and hermit crabs on the lagoon side.  The pool was refreshing after swimming in the ocean.  Adeymar was super helpful from the ve"

We love to come to Isla and stay at Ikal.  We have stayed here twice!  Adeymar and Adolfo are the best hosts we have ever stayed with.  Adeymar is so helpful in helping us book things even outside the property.  He came along with us on our last adventure and took some great photos while we were on a whale shark tour!   He even helped us book a private chef to create a wonderful dinner on the rooftop patio. The property is spacious with a ground level pool and roof top dipping pool.  The chairs and hammock 
"This place was incredible.  It's a beautiful property with ocean views and so much privacy.  But you can find a lot of pretty places to stay.  The staff makes this place great.  Adeymar and Adolfo made the trip so easy to just enjoy ourselves.  They can arrange travel from the airport and dock, set up your daily trips, (we went to swim with whale sharks) the recommendation for local food was good.  We saw 3 sea turtles nesting on the beach the first night.  I can't believe the colors of blue in the wayer.  "
"We booked this place without reading the reviews, and that was a mistake because after arriving we found that many of the negative reviews are spot on.  The check-in experience was maddening. The place has you sign a stack of contracts and a blank credit card slip that they will fill in later. Truly bizarre, especially considering you cannot charge room service or meals to your room—you settle up each and every time. And we had pre-paid for our room.  There is no hot water. You know those beautiful bath tub"
"If you want a vacation in paradise where you don't have to plan or worry about anything stay at Ikal in Isla Mujeres. The hosts Adeymar and Adolfo are a breath of fresh air. The minute I booked the resort I was contacted by Adeymar. He is the sweetest, most energetic, full of life host you could ever hope for. He handled everything for me. I am the planner of the group and sometimes that takes away from the vacation because I am worrying about the details for everyone else. When you stay at Ikal the ocean v"

Many other aspects of the place are run down—walls that need a paint job, wood that needs refinishing or tile that is mildewy or cracked.  The rooms are quite small—just big enough for a king-sized bed, the bath tub (which you won’t use unless you like cold baths) and a small side chair. The balcony is nice, but n"

"Stayed a full week with 3 other lades in Chuck and Sue's condo. It was perfect. Loved having access to a washing machine and dryer. The condo was roomy, with 2 king size beds and 2 full bathrooms. Nicely decorated and cool. The pools were clean but especially enjoyed the roof pool. We had it to ourselves. There is a large table and bar for taking snacks while enjoying the pool and sun. We were able to park our golf cart easily. Top notch host ... Thank you Chuck and Sue for sharing your wonderful home with "
"This is really a great place to stay. Especially for 2 reasons: the host Adeymar - he is very friendly and helpful and secondly it’s not where everyone is, it’s at a quiet spot next to a laguna. The place is new and everything is handled really flexible. Adeymar even helped us to get groceries and showed us around. I can really recommend this place! "

The service from Pedro, George and Leon was exceptional, if you have the luck of staying here make sure you look for these guys because they practically run Tulum 👌The food was delicious, the facilities are incrediblhy beautiful.  I really loved everything about this vacation."
"My family of five stayed at 2201 condo, what an amazing view! The kitchen was exactly as pictured , pools always clean and inviting, it’s mid point on the island so I’d suggest a golf cart to get around the island . Many great restaurants. ( Oscar’s is amazing ) If u need to shop for groceries , it’s about 4 minutes away from main grocery store on island. If u plan to relax then this is the place.  Beds were great, internet is typical , on and off though the day. No main tv but had Netflix or amazon tv.   T"
"As the title describes, my stay here was excellent! The food was absolutely delicious, I do think the service at the restaurant could be a bit better but to be honest everything else makes up for that. I was kinda hesitation on the location but after this I have no doubt this is the best spot in Tulum. It's not crowded, there is no traffic, no people on the beach or streets trying to sell you stuff, for me and my wife this is paradise."
"While this is a fairly new property, it showed serious signs of neglect during our recent visit there. Last Christmas, our condo was pristine, the complex was bustling with residents and visitors, and the restaurant downstairs served delicious food and had a vibrant happy hour. This Christmas, the condo felt abandoned--dusty, mildewy, with some problems like a lack of hot water in the showers, porch doors that wouldn't lock, and a beautiful stove featuring one working burner that we had to light with a matc"

"We stayed for 6 nights in 2403 and couldn't have enjoyed our stay more. The location of Isla 33 is mid-island so it's an easy golf cart {or taxi ride} to either end. The condo's are newer and the grounds are nicely kept. There are three pools, two at ground level and one on the roof - which has an amazing view of the ocean and stairs that lead to a pavilion for a 360 view of the island. There is an elevator for those that can't manage stairs, or just to use for luggage. They also have covered parking for go"

We were given a map and recommendations for places to eat.

There were two bathrooms, one in the master bedroom and one just outside the second bedroom.  The condo was spotless and th"

Took us an hour to get ahold of the front desk to let us in (because they keep the door locked) and they didn't have a key for us to get in the building. Ended up having to climb the balcony to get into our room on more than 1 occasion. We were also charged extra at check out because our towels were dirty.. would not recommend to anyone young and even slightly active or adventurous "
"We booked this place through booking.com and it was one of a handful bookings during our journey where we felt the presentation did not match our experience. We expected a kind of ""boutique"" hotel, but it's not, it's just a quite basic place by (and owned by) the adjacent church.  When we arrived after a very long journey the hotel was locked and the reception empty. Panic! We found a very helpful shop owner who could call staff an his mobile (we couldn't find any usable network at all), and after 20 minute"

So we got another room, and a much classier one with a safe, a sofa, a table and a refrigerator. The previous room had none of these things, so this one felt much more like what we had expected initially.

We could have stayed at a nicer hotel and paid separately for breakfast and spent less.  We would not recommend unless the price is $50 US per night or less.

I requested room 7 in a message to the property.The place is part of a catholic church right next to it. The guy at the reception had no idea of my booking. I showed a copy on my phone to him  ..then he couldn't find the keys for the room. It appears someone asignates the rooms based on how much they pay!

This is a beautiful property. Puerta al Mar is a quiet condo complex on Sac Bajo. It does not have a bar or restaurant but is near them.  The pool is wonderful and it is right on the beach. Each unit is individually owned and is decorated differently.

This trip was just 5 days & I brought a friend that hadn’t ever travele"

"This is an incredibly good value place to stay. Order a sea view room as the small amount of extra is well worth it for the stunning views. We had a very large terrace overlooking the sea. Taxis are so cheap that the out of town location is no issue and hiring a golf buggy for the day to explore is a must. The breakfast was nice and again, you could sit outside on the stunning terrace and watch the sea and visiting iguanas. Well worth visiting this island and if you do, this is a great place to stay."
"Unit 501 was absolutely stunning! There are multiple  balconies stretching across the luxurious condo. The rooftop pool was great; we watched sail boats glide across the seas as we enjoyed drinks in the pool. Isla Mujeras was also extremely safe and comfortable; the host and staff were extremely helpful.  We plan on making a trip back next year, we highly recommend!"
We stayed for 2 nights before moving to our rental.  Nice and clean and good location.  Beds just a little too firm for me.  Roof top pool had a very nice view.  Continental breakfast was nice.  Other than that enjoyed our stay

The hosts cared about each host to make your experience personalized. From getting your coffee order the night before, to booking all our tours and reservations (with a discount!) I would never stay anywhere else in Isla Mujeres."
"We really liked this place.  The staff is great and the return to is awesome and pretty much the same prices you will find around the island.  I loved the pool and the view.  No swimming in the ocean though.  My only criticism is that it would have been nice to have a door on our bathroom and some of the sheets had stains, which I wasn’t crazy about.  It is a good deal for the price you pay. The margaritas are strong FYI!"

I have mixed reviews for Casa Bonita.  Although I loved our stay on isla mujeres and I enjoyed our stay at casa Bonita I believed it was lacking in many areas.  I doh t I would return.  The people were absolutely delightful despite the language barrier.  We stayed in the penthouse and it was perfect for the 4 adults and 3 children.  Lots of space.  But The terrace that could have been so perfect had they provided decent furniture was very disappointing to have a bunch or ratty old kitchen chairs and a table

It sits on the east coast of the island and has access to a beautiful rocky beach. A double terraced patio and restaurant along with a pool overlook the sea. The food in the restaurant was ah-mazing! And the staff are really friendly. Most of the island’s beaches are naturally rocky, with the only sandy beaches bei"

She worked out a great deal for golf carts for us, which were waiting for us at the condo. She was also there to great us. This being our second trip this year to Isla, we like the south end a bit more. Very quiet, beach not so great and of course the views are just fantastic. We loved how big the pool is. The condo was big enough for my in laws, my mother,"

Nestled on a quiet, private beach, NEST is a small adults-only hotel that blends into the jungle with a focus on eco-conscious tourism. Everything about NEST was impeccable. Our room had a private balcony overlooking the ocean. The food was incredible - we ate breakfast and lunch there every day because why mess with a great thing? The location is right in the heart of Tulum Beach, within walking distance of countless amazing restauran"
I had not dove in several years. Manuel did a great job getting my neutral buoyancy back up to speed. The Sea Hawk's Discover Scuba package was excellent as well. Now my son wants to get certified. I will definitely book more trips!
"We rented the house, there was 8 in our group. First of all, our flights were 10 hrs delayed, we were unable to communicate with Lisa as we were on a flight. Our wedding party of 4 Guests were also delayed, Lisa was very unhelpful and had NO compassion for our situation. Our guests were late getting in, and noone was there to meet them at the house.  We never made the ferry, and ended up having to stay the night in Cancun. All Lisa was concerned about was getting her final payment, in which she insisted we "

The rooms may have looked as serene and clean as seen on the website at one time, but that is no longer the case! It was somewhat strange that the shower was not in the bathroom and instead was in the kitchen. The glass had been partially frosted but anyone using the shower could still be seen in the living room and kitchen. We could get past that.

We were charged the 600.00$ for supposingly liquor license . We never saw a license posted once. And I am pretty sure a license does not cost 600.00$USD. Once our numbers changed for the wedding we found Lisa very unhelpful and at times snotty. She took it personally, this was not her day, and she was not empathetic AT ALL. We were allowed "

"My husband and I spent 4 nights here recently and really enjoyed Isla Mujeres. We stayed in the Harmony room which had a beautiful ocean view, although we couldn’t really keep the curtains open to appreciate the view because anybody using the pool was just a couple of meters away and could see right in.  The hotel isn’t central so you always have to get a taxi to the center, but they are easy enough to get and cheap. The room was always kept clean, but it was quite small and cramped.  The staff were friendl"
"Right on the ocean!!! This little place had everything we needed for 5 days in paradise. So much so that we are coming back in August!   Pros:  Right on ocean: amazing view and sound of waves  Lots of seating on patio:  Hammock and chairs out back  Lighted sitting area out front  Soaking pool Water jug Mini fridge and microwave  Comfy firm bed with mattress foam Ac worked great  Great housekeeping  Accommodating late check in   Cons or areas of improvement: No hot water at all, even after running for 5 min "

"This was our second stay at Casa Bonita and we will be back many more times!  Not your typical hotel or bnb, Casa Bonita is like staying at a family property where the staff know your name and treat you like one of their own.  Thank you to the Garza family for their hospitality and thank you to Lisa Clemens for all that she does to make your stay on Isla perfect!"

"Absolutely will be returning to Nest Tulum! My boyfriend and I had the most incredible experience here - it is paradise. Exceptional attention to detail, service, food, and accommodations. It is such an intimate and breathtaking environment and a perfect sliver of peace in the heart of Tulum beach. Hotel staff were incredibly kind and gave us a room upgrade, multiple surprise gifts as we were celebrating a birthday, and enabled late checkout. Already planning next trip back."
"We stayed 4 days at the penthouse with our family of 10 and had a wonderful time. The penthouse is large enough for 5 adults 3 teenagers and a twin of 8. We enjoyed the gorgeous views from the terrace, the pool and the private little beach.  The owners are wonderful and it was the perfect stay for our family. We would love to come again!"
"I loved everything about Latino Boutique Hotel and my room, and it is definitely the best hotel for the money that I have ever stayed in. I planned a last-minute solo trip and booked this hotel during my layover with no research and I was blown away. The location is perfect - just one street back from the main drag tucked away in a residential area with restaurants and cute spots, easily walkable to everywhere in Tulum Pueblo.  It's quiet and peaceful, and the hotel itself has quiet hours. There's some mino"

The restaurant and the beach area are so beautiful. The food was amazing, especially the complimentary breakfast which exceeded all our expectations. We can’t wait to go back here in the future!"
"Our family of 5 had a great time in Isla!  Part of that was due to the absolutely amazing manager Lisa!  She was super helpful in all aspects of our vacation!  Casa Bonita is closer to the south end of the island so I would recommend a golf cart for your stay.  Lisa helped us procure one on our first day, that we kept for the week.  The beach is very small at this location but we still enjoyed it!  There are many nearby beaches to enjoy - just ask!  I highly recommend Isla for a family friendly vacation.  M"
" know them over my stay - shoutout to Janeth and Lucia. When my shower head needed tweaked, they fixed it in on the spot and when I had some bug bites, they offered me cream. Each of the 13 rooms was named after a fruit. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to Toronja (Grapefruit), the penthouse, with a king bed, double sinks, and balcony with a soaking tub and hammock. I saw other rooms that were equally cute and well thought out. They really think of everything - double window shades, ceiling fan, great A/C"

When I was feeling like absolute hell in the days following chemotherapy… when even drinking water was painful… when I was totally sick, I would visualize myself healthy, happy and in a gorgeous beach in Tulum. As soon as the doctors said I was finally ok, I booked the trip and found Nest… Everyone at Nest was so kind… no one knew what I had gone through, yet they all were all kind and welcoming and "

Nice little cleaned pool. Free coffee and hot water in the mornings. Lounge area with microwave, ice machine and oven. If you book smaller room and have no fridge, you can use the fridge in the lounge area.

"We had our wedding at The Nest and our reception on Nu.  We purchased all the rooms at The Nest for our family and friends and the staff couldn't have been more attentive.  They made my elderly parents feel right at home and took such great care of our closest friends and family.  All of guests said this was the best wedding they have ever been too.  The food was to die for!   The rooms are great, very Tulum.  Wild is a sister restaurant we are at, and the food was out of this world delicious!  I thank the "
"The resort is on a quiet part of the beach, and the surroundings are gorgeous.  The staff was well-prepared and attentive during our entire stay.  They provided us with suggestions for tours and restaurants in the area and kept the room stocked with potable water.  We will definitely return and stay at this wonderful resort!"
We came to Tulum with no reservation and literally found the area we wanted to be in and accidentally stumbled upon this delightful boutique.  It was renovated in 2020 and is exquisite. Expect some noise from neighboring streets but the hotel itself is gorgeous. Every room is completely unique and themed after a tropical fruit...ours was passion fruit. Gorgeous murals in the rooms and courtyard...every detail is thought through. Courtyard is beautiful and cozy. Good wifi and staff treated us like we were fa
"This is a perfect, peaceful getaway in Tulum! A small boutique hotel (only 13 rooms) with amazing facilities. The beds are super comfortable, shower is perfect, beach beds are everything you need, breakfast (and all other food) delicious and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Location is also perfect! Almost everything on walking distance, and otherwise you can use their bikes for free. Don’t skip a facial/massage!!"
"My wife and I spent 7 days in Tulum at the Sanara!  Fantastic accommodations, super clean & comfortable rooms, courteous & friendly staff.  We enjoyed the restaurant The Real Coconut and the Spa as well.  Our concierge Bryan did a fantastic job of lining up dive trips for us and Covid testing.  Would highly recommend Sanara it truly lived up to its reviews!!"
"Loved this hotel. Helpful front desk staff, relaxing courtyard, cute small pool, small communal kitchen. Get a second floor room with hammock and patio. Hot water is good, takes a few minutes to warm up. Our room was cream colored and simply but elegantly furnished. In the heart of Tulum, steps from the main boardwalk.  One tip: if you arrive in the evening, come via the main road in Tulum, 307. When we were there, numerous side roads had construction under way. Piles of rubble, giant potholes, motorcycles,"
"Had a fantastic time and great location ,however after paying a lot for the accommodation and always tipping the restaurant staff when we had breakfast and lunch ( food was lovely ) and paying for hotel bikes and the normal taxes they stuck another 921 dollars on bill ( optional) after giving you the bill for gratuity for the hotel staff !! Left a bad taste as always paid the service for everything we already had ! Watch out for this additional cost !!"

"Wow, this place is amazing and beautiful. The staff bent over backwards to make sure we were accommodated. We explained to Letty what we had in mind and she organized the whole thing, so easy. We saw ruins, monkeys and a locals only cenote. The spa great,  I had the best message of my life and you can’t beat doing yoga with the beautiful  ocean right in our face. The hotel has day beds reserved for the guests on the beach. Definitely want to come back and stay again."

"We loved everything about our experience at Sanara.  My daughter and I had such a wonderful and relaxing vacation.  We didn't leave the Sanara oasis except to take Long Beach walks.  Everyone was accommodating, cheerful and helpful.  The restaurant ""the real coconut"" was fabulous and healthy.  We still managed to over indulge.  But hey, it was vacation!  Our Villa was simple, clean and well appointed.  We loved the private patio in the rear with a hammock, table for two and a claw foot tub.  Which I used ev"

"Group of 13 guided by Roly who masterfully mixed location highlights with clever anecdotes in English, Spanish and Spanglish. Even those that came in a little apprehensive about traversing the submerged sections were so distracted by his conversation and reassurances that they didn’t hesitate to follow along.  Proved to be the highlight of our Tulum adventures."

"It’s nice to swim and cool off from the hot sun, especially if you first wasted time going to Tulum, but I wouldn’t view this as a primary destination. There were a lot of people; more than is comfortable for the size of the cenotes. "
Cenote Tortuga came recommended to us from our resort and it did not disappoint! The tour was $25 and lasted 90 minutes. We swam in 4 different cenotes on the property- 2 closed and 2 open ones- all were amazing. Make sure to wear shoes you can get wet and bring $ for a locker. 
"The worst service of the complete town, they removed me from my table because I was 1 person with m baby consuming versus family of four, even thought my husband was going to consume after his yoga lesson. It’s a complete contradiction their concept of wellness when they prove they only care for making big tickets. A shame! Wellness is to embrace in all the aspects and not only a marketing concept"
We stayed at the hotel on the property for two nights. With the hotel stay you get 50% discount on the cenote tour which turned out to be 100 pesos per person. The tour of the cenotes was great and we could enjoy the “open air” cenote all night when there were no other people. The hotel room had a small kitchen area which was perfect to cook small meals. Definitely worth the money if you prefer staying off the beaten path and away from the crowds.

This was our first trip to a Cenote and very near to where we were staying. For 450 pesos we were equipped with life vests and masks but not snorkels as they really weren’t needed.  The first Cenote was a small rocky pond to jump into. We walked 5 minutes to the second one which was like a open lazy river with jumping platforms. The third and fourth cenotes were caves that you swam through and out the other end.  At their lowest point the roof of the cave was 1/2m above the water surface.  I can get claustr
"We had shifted from hotel Alaya which is just a 2 minute walk from Sanara. Alaya turned out to be a real dump even though it is rated no. 4 on TA. Sanara deserves to be number 1. The rooms are excellent, we had a two bedroom suite and it was very comfortable, relaxing and quiet. The beach access is great. The yoga classes were amazing. My wife is vegan so she loved the on site restaurant - Real Coconut. This is a great place to stay in Tulum right close to all the nice restaurants. The service is excellent."
" are very good value, some others are 600 pesos.     There was a photographer with us but no pressure to even have your photo taken.  There were toilets and change rooms and plenty of parking. The road was in fair condition so your car won’t be damaged!"
"Tv it doesnt work.  Next door there is a construction and they start early 9 in the morning to make noise. Impossible to sleep. No breakfast at all. Pool close 9 pm to early. Empty place.  Not friendly staff.  First nigth I almost sleep on the street cuz nobody answer the bell door, I call by phone none pick up the phone so I decided to push the gate until I could open it and somebody sleepy shows up. I record the moment with my phone. For the price I pay its unbelievable. Back pain bed is not really comfy,"
"You pay for beds but you get SOFA beds and they won't even do the beds or provide bedclothes despite the fact that the room description says BEDS. They didn't do anything whatsoever to sort it out and were very rude. We arrived at 5:30 pm so it was a reasonable time, they could have prepared the sofa beds or at least provided bedclothes (they said they would). Apparently the person that does the beds was gone and the 2 employees standing at reception chatting and doing nothing wouldn't lift a finger to help"
Rooms are spacious and clean. We got the a room with terrace and it was really nice.   The gym is very well equipped and the pool area is clean and super relaxing.   Mary at the front desk was AWESOME! Really friendly and helpful. So was the older gentleman working at the front. I deeply appreciate their awesome service!   The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars- There were small ants in the room :(  The hotel needs to call pest control ASAP!  Also- The cleaning lady was a little impatient and rude when c

We stayed here during our trip to Tulum and it was amazing. We checked in a little earlier than expected but the young lady at the front desk was super friendly and let us keep our luggage in a secure area. The whole process was fast and the location is great! The hotel from the outside and inside offered vibrant color schemes and the rooms were very comfortable for the price. We will definitely want to stay again when we come back to Tulum! We weren’t able to go to the Gran Cenote like we planned due to ti

This isn’t the hotel fault BUT literally 2 ft away directly next to Live Tulum is huge construction work going on, it’s the loudest concrete drilling I’ve ever heard and the floor was shaking, they’ve only just star"

Heavy rain (cyclone) today and power had  been out for hours. One cannot control Mother Nature, but how we handle such ordeal is what makes the difference.

We paid a 1000 mex peso deposit for the bicycles (which we got back when we checked out) and used them multiple times throughout the week.

Not a hold, but a charge. Second, we had to change bike 4 times due to it falling apart. My wheel broke in one of the sights and I had to w"
"The most negative and unfriendly welcome I have ever experienced on arrival at a hotel. The staff at reception are literally the antithesis of the Tulum vibe. They then put us in a pokey room opposite the reception and when I asked if any other rooms were available they said “the hotel is fully booked” then I asked if I could pay for an upgrade and suddenly there were several options available. As a very regular traveler, in Europe and Asia whenever there is availability in a better room type then it is alw"

"We stayed two nights after a week in Cancun, and we wished that we had stayed here the whole time.  We could easily walk downtown for food.  We walked there from the ferry.  The woman who maintains the location took us down to rent a gold cart, and it was significantly less than the other locations.    I wholeheartedly recommend both Isla Mujeres and Villa Bliss 18 (their name now).  We are from California, so watching the sun rise over the ocean is a treat for us (we only get sunsets.)"

"Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Nothing like the photos. Noisy, smelt of rotting garbage, no hot water, dirty kitchen, broken windows. A man found dead in the hotel during our stay (see news reports!) and hotel was shut down. We were not offered another hotel even though other guests were, so were forced to spend Christmas period with police outside our rooms guarding a crime scene- horrific experience. Avoid! Have tried to contact hotel since and have been ignored."
"This is NOT a 2-3 star hotel.  One star at best.  Construction noise past 9pm?!  Hammering, chiseling?  Sawing?  What hotel does this to their guests?  My room was nothing like the photos.  I repeat NOTHING like the pictures.  Horrible stay.  Will not return."

Concrete drilling and hammer-and-chisel off-and-on all day until 8:30-9:00pm. My room #17 was on the same floor. The noise sounded all around, loudly, because that's how concrete conducts sound -- through the walls, floors, and ceilings.   Both sinks both dripped steadily.

When I asked for a partial refund for staying while construction was going on, I got the ""no comprende"" look until I walked away. Wi-fi was inconsistent, too, likely because front desk and maintenance employees were all on their phones, thumbing away, burning up bandwidth. I've lived on Isla. Before that, I'd stayed many times,"

"We were excited to spend time here this March. We were going to spend time with our son, daughter inlaw and grandson. Our son and his family happened to be in Isla Mujeres and went to inspect this property and to reintroduce themseleves as they have stayed there before. What they found was that there is construction all about, windows boarded up and the buildings in a state of unacceptable conditions. They immediate messaged the owners and got a refund. I messaged them and he refused to refund my deposit. T"
"This hotel is for someone who is looking to spend time OUT of the hotel. It's a nice enough place to stay, change, sleep, shower, etc.. but it's in no way luxurious or where you'll want to have a relaxing vacation. It's a short walk from the beach. The only problems we had here were that I had exchanged USD for pesos and they said it was a bit more, I think we ended up paying $15 more than expected. And the air conditioner leaked a large puddle onto the floor. Everything at the hotel was simple and we had a"
"I reserved 5 days at Mar y Sol.  I arrived at night and by the next day, it was clear that this was the spot I was hoping to find along my travels!  So I stayed for the entire length of my trip, 30 days.  Now, if you are looking for something fancy, this is not your place.  But if you want something private with an peaceful environment and the most welcoming host ever, Roberto, this is your place.  My 7 year old daugther and I loved loved loved it!  Safe, comfortable, amicable, close to awesome snorkling an"
"We spent five nights at Mar y Sol in unit #7, one of the two upstairs units in the newer (bright yellow) building.  We absolutely LOVED it!  The room is huge with a nice balcony and hammock that looks out over the water.  The kitchenette allowed us to cook a hot breakfast every morning.  The beach is right outside the door and the sand is fine and soft.  There's a pier very close by that is fun to jump off of and swim from (bring a snorkel!).  It's very quiet at night and the bed was comfortable.  It's only"
"We stayed in room 18. The room itself is plenty big with a kitchenette and decent size refrigerator. Most things needed are provided.  The room has a very large patio we enjoyed nightly. Note that the room faces east and will have bright morning sun. If this is not something you enjoy, you may want a different room. With that said, you will also be missing out on some great views and ocean breezes.  This hotel is a very short walk to the Super Aqi grocery store and many good restaurants and bars, yet far en"
Maravilloso hotel muy limpio el personal es muy amable siempre sonriente y dispuesto a ayudar nuestra estancia estuvo genial la alberca grande y muy rica .nos llevaron un agua Chile de camarón delicioso .la vista me enamoro estuvimos en el 3er nivel
"My husband & I stayed here for 2 weeks in March/April 2013. The kitchenette was sufficient to make our meals. It had a microwave, fridge, sink, & 2 burner hot plate. Since we're on a special diet, this worked well for us. Some of the metal things in the room were a little rusty, probably from being near the water. The location was great. It was like having a home on the beach. There were not a lot of other guests when we were there, so it was very quiet for us. It's close to the public bus line also. One dr"
" quiet was disturbed occasionally by the party boats that come from Cancun to the restaurants/bars on either side of this place. But, it didn't bother us that much. For the price, we think it was a great value. You are right on the water and far enough away from the road that it's quiet. We really enjoyed out stay there. I can't say what it would be like with a lot of guests, but there are only 8 units, so there wouldn't be a huge crowd anyway. They were very good about bringing drinking water whenever you "
"What could I say, it was the best decision to stay at this place! Edwin, the owner gave us all the local informations and showed us the non tourist places for food, sunsets, sunrises. He really made our stay special and that’s been on top of the wonderful view we had from our little balcony over the Caribbean ocean."
"Lleguè con mis amigos, el hotel me parecio bonito, tiene lo basico, es perfecto para personas que tienen planeado conocer Isla Mujeres todo el dia, y llegar al hotel a dormir o a disfrutar de la alberca. Todas las habitaciones son vista al mar, asi que tendran una hermosa vista por las mañanas. Tienen frigobare por si quieres guardar comida o bebidas. El personal es muy amable. Mi estancia ahi fue agradable aunque lo unico que le restaria puntos es la ubicacion ya que un taxi para llegar hasta alla te cobro"

"Cute little apartments with a small kitchen area.  Overall it was fine and the beach was great...even had a perfect palm tree leaning over the water.  We did not have any water pressure in the shower and the mosquitos were terrible in the room but that was an easy fix with the help of bug spray!  So nice to sit on the little back porch and enjoy coffee while the sun comes up.  We stayed in the newer building, room 6, which had a/c and it kept the room very cool.  The beds were not very comfortable but that "
"Lola is in a category of its own. The house, staff and personal service exceeded our expectations on every level. The chef created amazing meals, and Kevin and the entire staff catered to our every need. If you are looking for a high-end, red carpet experience, Lola is the place!"
"We have stayed here before and it was about the same as before......we really like the area and the rooms, but it isn't for everyone.  Like upscale camping.  We were there right after the hurricane and there was flooding, but not as bad as many places.  We were the only people there and loved the privacy.  We will stay there again and would recommend Mar y Sol for people like us.  Rented from Mornings in Mexico and they were great to work with."
"Went on our first trip to Mexico in oct. 2009. Decided on Isla Mujeres based on reviews from friends. Wanted cheap accommodation, on the beach, away from all the tourist traps. It was perfect! Stayed on the old building - a yes, I admit it was a worn down, but the sea-view and the beach and the price makes it all worth while. We only used the room for sleeping and showering and in the regard, Mar Y Sol is worth it. We spent a lot of time on the beach, tanning and swimming in the sea - the snorkling isn't al"
"Our room was basic it had a bed, refrigerator for our drinks, room was kept clean, pool was clean and refreshing, breakfast in morning cereal, toast coffee etc. The hotel was in the middle of town so very easy to go anywhere. If there was a problem with translation there was a computer that helpled. Wi-fi was fine. Definitely worth the money. Would go again and would recommend it. The Canadian girls."
"Let's start with the good, to be positive: Nice front desk guy. It technically has a shower and a bed and a roof to sleep under. It also has AC. Now the bad: It looks nothing like the photo shown above that's advertised. This place is really dirty, the walls are just disgusting and covered in mold and who knows what else that was. It's also painted about 6 different colors, I assume to paint over the filth with whatever color is nearby. We had cockroaches in our room. The shower ""door"" was carefully placed "
"So, we were took our golf cart to the ""bar next door"" to this but were told that they were too full? Really? We decided to walk next door to Skulls Landing and have a drink and come back. Well, thanks ""bar next door!"" We walked into awesome music, friendly staff (Tiffany and Julio) and just a good island overall vibe. We ended up staying here a long time and having a blast! They staff gave us tons of tips about the island. Needless to say, so long "" bar next door"" HELLO Skulls Landing!!!!! See you soon! The"
" slept on terrible beds). This thing was like sleeping on concrete with springs sticking out of it. The pool was murky, it has maybe a 2 inch visibility. They also said my booking didnt go through and I had to pay cash when I got there.. which I'm looking into next to make sure I didn't pay twice. This hotel was shockingly bad and I already had low expectations. It needs a complete overhaul and cleaning up. Overall I would not stay here again."
"El mejor lugar en Isla para relajarte, beber algo rico y comer delicioso. Me encantó el muelle, puedes estar ahí pasando una buena tarde. El atardecer es hermoso. Me encantó disfrutar con mis amigos el atardecer."

"We had the Room ""Balboa"" and we really liked it - for the money we payed it was really nice! We had a Balcony, a small Bathroom, a kingsize bed, AC & TV and at least a Refrigerator which is really nice for water or a beer you can enjoy on the balcony. Some wrote that the personal is unprofessional, but we had no reason to complain! We asked for other chairs and they immediately changed them. And you get a small breakfast here with real coffee (no nescafe) and some toast & cereals. We really recommend stayin"
This hotel has gone thru a name change (formerly Caracol) and management change and all is going very well. My wife and I stayed there for a week and the place was great. The place is being renovated and looks fantastic. The staff absolutely could not have been better. Ignore all previous reviews as it is all old news. Hats off to the management for turning this place into a hidden gem!
"This year we stayed at Casa Espana again for about 9 days. It is a nice intimate hotel. Last year we stayed but were not very happy with the cleanliness and the attitude of the staff. This year we came again because of the recommendation of our friends who stay there for 10 months of the year. What a change. Gaby, the new manager has managed to revive the place, make it a happy place with staff that is helpful and with big smiles. The place is cute, clean and inviting. Yes, a place that we would like to ret"
"We book over booking .com  It was:ISLA HOTEL CARACOL. When we arrive we couldn't find hotel   They change name: CASA ESPANA.. We seach walk around over 2 hours. Finally we call them find out........,,, Hotel is old  bed was noisy not worth what we payed.   I wouldn't stay here again "
"Casa Espana is a small hotel right in the middle of town. It's situated within minutes of the ferry terminal, beaches and all the shops, restaurants and bars. However it is quiet and peaceful, with rooms facing into a small courtyard and pool area. The staff were all very friendly and made our stay very pleasant. The room was clean and comfortable and very good value. Highly recommended"
I made the mistake of asking for a small reading lamp as the room was very dark at night.The bad attitude of the Jefe/manager turned me right off this place.That and two glasses for our room was more than he could manage.He even sneered at me that people who/stay there don't read! We have lived and travelled extensively in Mexico for over forty years and have grown to love the charm and quirkiness of small Mexican hotels.We can overlook no clean towels the broken stair railing and no maid service but we can
"We opted for a large room with a king bed, and were lucky to get a room on the second floor. Very comfortable room, bed, everything. Good lighting, black out curtains, artwork, etc. The icing on the cake was the fabulous breakfast we got each day. A lot of places are kind of miserly about breakfast - not Mestizo Gallery. They serve both juice and a generous fruit plate, an entree of chilaquiles, eggs, pancakes or waffles - every one of them absolutely delicious - served with excellent coffee. WE also ate di"
"I booked this hotel to stay for August 20-21, 2021.  We were staying in Cozumel and planning to take the ferry to Playa del Carmen and dive the cenotes when we were in Tulum.  Unfortunately, Hurricane Grace came in on August 19th, 2021.  It damaged the docks in Playa del Carmen.  We were unable to get to Tulum due to the damages.  Despite explaining this in the cancellation of our stay they refused to cancel even a portion of the cost of the room.  We had planned to dive Cenotes another time and stay with t"
"This hotel is located right in the middle between Tulum Beach and Tulum Downtown. It’s one of the closest hotels to most of the cenotes including: Cenote Calavera, Gran Cenote, Cenote Car Wash and Cenote Zacil Ha. It was in walking distance to tulum downtown and bike ride to the beach is fairly short. To me it was the perfect location, also right next to an atm, grocery store, taxi stop and restaurants.  I was nervous going to Mexico but this place really felt like a home away from home. Food and drink is a"
 where ever we wanted (room or pool). When I go back to Tulum I will definitely be booking with this hotel no doubt!! I was actually sad to leave this place.  10/10 recommend this place! Do not hesitate to book with Meztiso Hotel.

"The hotel room was very clean, quiet, and spacious.   The breakfast was good and the staff were helpful and kind.  We stayed 2 nights and realized Tulum is not for us and we spent our days in Akumal.  It is within walking distance to things, but it is a very busy area.  So, if Tulum is for you this is a clean and spacious place to stay."
Only stayed 1 night but it was very enjoyable and can recommend.  We arrived about 6 pm on a Friday night and once we got settled into our well decorated room we walked the city and had a blast.  Our stay came with a free breakfast and it was an ideal ala cart breakfast.  Sounds a bit boring but on our way back through Tulum five days later we stopped there for breakfast again.
"I’ve stayed here multiple times this past year. It’s such a beautiful clean environment within walking distance to grocery store, corner stores and restaurants plus main BLVD. The staff and owners  are so friendly and willing to serve you at anytime. I love walking to the atrium that has a decent wading pool after a long hot day. Each morning I’m greeted with the best fresh juice and rolls with my choice of eggs Or hot cakes. Splendid service with such kind smiles. I feel like they want me here and are will"

This is the perfect spot to spend your vacation or special date. We really enjoyed my birthday night.   Is all clean and the owners is kind and helpful. All supplies to prevent COVID-19 is provided.   The view right from the bed is amazing and peacefull
Stayed February 2017. Perfect mid island ocean front apartment. Host is very responsive. Apartment with restaurants within walking distance. No beach access on location. Parking on site for golf cart. We will stay again. 
"A beautiful place with wonderful people running it. Peter is very attentive and helps with everything that is needed, the place was clean and quiet while being in a very good location. would go there again"
The staff was very helpful and recomended us about atractions and resturants.  We had a problem with the hot water in the shower and they took care of it very quickly.  They made our stay very enjoyable and comfortable.  Muchas gracias amigos!!! 
"Location is pretty good. Right next to a big crossing which makes the street a bit busy, but has the advantage of making it easy to go to the beaches and Mayan ruins. Also, there is a huge supermarket when you cross the street. The city center is at walking distance, and you'll easily walk to all the restaurants and the boulevard.  The hotel itself is fine. Everything is like in the pictures and works good. Also, there is a fridge which makes that you can cool your own water our beer. The feel of our room w"
I had booked a reservation for March 23 and was very excited for my visit to Tulum however because of the ongoing COVID19 situation the Canadia n government has advised all citizens to avoid unnecessary travel because of this unforeseen global pandemic. We reached out through booking.com to cancel our reservations and were told that they were unable to make an exception and that they could not refund our booking again because we are unable to make our reservation due to the A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. So this busine

"My spouse and i stayed here for two nights and would have stayed longer if time permitted.   The rooms weren't fancy, but were very clean had everything you would need.  The staff was incredibly helpful in getting around. Freshly prepared breakfast with several options was a highlight! The bikes available for use provided even more freedom around the area. The Pacha Tulum is located just off a main intersection, but was very quiet.   Would absolutely stay here again on our next visit to Tulum."
"My partner and I stayed here for just the one night, which was highly disappointing, as I could of stayed for days! It’s the perfect little place, hidden away of the main Tulum road, so it’s a great location! (With no noise! 🙏🏻) the pool and breakfast area is really cute, along with breakfast being really tasty! It’s included in the room rate and you get a choice of about 5 options, along with tea and coffee! The owner is Italian, so as you can guess is super friendly, welcoming and happy to help in any way"
Lovely boutique hotel in the centre of Tulum. Very clean and comfortable and 20 min bike ride from the beach. Lovely and helpful staff. You will feel like at home. Bikes rent and delicious breakfast included!
"My partner and I stayed here for part of our large holiday. The hospitality here is amazing! The hotel is small and has a kind of rainforest feel! The rooms have everything you may need and indeed not 5 star luxury but the beds are comfy, the air con is great and the bathroom is all you need :)  We found the free hire of bikes, snorkels and flippers the best! Saved so much hassle and money! Just leave your deposit and done!  Also there is a big shopping centre across the road for supply’s, 2 restaurants nex"
"This could be the poorest designed and poorest equipped rental I have experienced anywhere. Very poor wifi (none in some rooms). Maid service once a week! Inadequate seating at unattractive pool. In short, look elsewhere "
"I booked this accommodation mostly for its nice looking rooms and air conditioning. When we turned up we were greeted by a topless man who was the owner. He gave us a very brief viewing of the communal areas and then took us to a door that looked like Harry Potter's cubboard under the stairs. We both thought he was joking, no door handle, but a hasp and clasp with the most insecure padlock I have ever seen. Inside the room it had no air conditioning, which when it's 30+ degrees for me is essential, especial"
 this pitiful 'accommodation'. 
"We arrived in the end of a corridor with no window, AC, TV or wifi. And it smelled like mould. We do not recommend this hotel to anyone. The host told us there where no other rooms.  Pictures on the website do not match reality."
"Had pre-paid for one night but all the rooms we were shown were filthy and smelly.  One room actually smell like vomit and beer and there was a half empty bottle of tequila on the night stand, and no bed linens.  Saving grace was the owner agreed to give me my money back."
We paid for a room with air conditioner. The air conditioner in the room didn't work but the stuff refused to refund us for the money. Do not go here !! The stuff isn't nice and the rooms are gross. No stream at the shower and the toilet didnt flash
"Don't be lured in by its ""bargain price"". The Hotel is old and terribly run down, we had 2 separate poky rooms with no windows to the outside world.   The rooms and bathrooms were tidy enough but the bed linens and pillows are old and dingy.   The staff didn't really care about anything, our light blew leaving our room (due to no windows) absolutely pitch black, they told us they had called an electrician. After 24 hours in darkness we opted to move out, I asked for a discount for the night as we were liter"
I put a few photos to show the state of my room at this hotel. As you see the place looks old and nott too clean. The sheets were clean though and there was a cleaning lady who did a very quick cleaning every day. Very central location too.
"For starters this place was absolutely filthy.  The floor hadn't been swept, or at least not very well at all.  There was a cigarette butt in plain sight against one of the walls, and black dirt and large dust bunnies were everywhere.  The bathroom absolutely reeked, and a quick inspection revealed why:  There was mold EVERYWHERE.  All over one wall, up on the ceiling, etc.  When I pulled back the top sheet it was obvious from what I found that the sheets had not been changed since the last hotel guest was "
" very early in the morning.  They advertise they have Internet, but they don't (or didn't when we were there).  Staff were fairly unhelpful.  When I didn't use them for our whale shark expedition, they were very pouty and cold for the rest of our stay.  With the plethora of other accommodations on the island, this should be your ""only if desperate"" choice, and even then you might consider trying to camp on the beach instead."

"I have been coming to Isla Mujeres for 15 years and have stayed in many places on the island.  While Casa Ixchel is clean and the staff seems to be very personable, in my opinion, there are much nicer places to stay on the island for the price they charge.   We had the one-bedroom suite, Abundance, on the first floor. The pictures on the website show a bright room with white curtains, a glass table and 4 chairs, and a toaster oven in the kitchen.  It looked really cute and charming and we were excited to go"
"La casa esta muy bonita pera lastima del pésimo servicio que tienen por parte de las personas que la dan a rentar, mala actitud, estando ya en el lugar nos fueron a sacar del área de la alberca con gritos porque no la podíamos usar, servicio que ya habíamos pagado, nunca se me informo de las reglas en el momento que nos la dieron a rentar; nos sacaron de la casa por que no es un lugar que podíamos utilizar como nos lo explicaron al principio fue totalmente distinto.

The bedroom, kitchen and bathroom windows all open up to the hallway so there is no natural light coming in those windows.

"This was a nice place to stay on the Island. It is in the middle of the island and is away from the noise near Playa Norte. There is a beautiful view of the water behind the hotel. The pool is decent too. It's nothing fancy but very quiet, peaceful, and relaxing. The restaurant at the top is pretty good. The waiter there was very friendly and often greeted us when we were passing in and out of the hotel.

It was our second time in Mundo Maya. Last year we have stayed for 4 nights as well. The place is great. The host Jose is very helpful and friendly. The breakfast is served in the cafe and it was the best breakfast which we had in Mexico. We travel a lot around the world and Mundo Maya is one of the best hostel which we have ever had. If you are looking for the affordable and at the same time clean and nice place Mundo Maya is the best option for you !
"This is the over-spill hotel for Weary Traveler. Rooms are small, there was no hot water for four days, rooms aren’t cleaned unless requested to protect you from theft (from the mouth of on site management) and the wifi is terrible. Stay somewhere else."

For the beach you Will need a bike, car or bus. Gabriela welcomed us very friendly and gave tips were to go. The hotel is basic but all you neee is there.

Only 3 blocks from the Ado bus depot on the main street.  Had a room with lots of space and two comfy double beds. Very clean and quiet. Great balcony overlooking the street. Management great. Only draw back was no fridge or coffee making facilities but restaurants and shops all just outside.
"We needed one night in Tulum during our trip and I wanted a place in town close to the bus station. Kin Ha Pueblo fit the bill but I can't give it very high ratings. The room was small with no real place to put your suitcases. The door to the room is a double door which closed with a clear gap -- a little disconcerting both for security and for the ability of mosquitos to get in. A continental breakfast is provided which was OK, nothing special. I think if we needed to be there more nights we would have cha"

It is based in the heart of central Tulum which is just few steps away to lovely bars, restaurants, shops and ADO bus station etc.  The room is clean and staff members are very friendly and helpful.

Where do I start... -WAY TOO OVERPRICED -The doors to the room are so flimsy it does not feel safe you could literally push it open -There was no running water for most of our stay and no one seemed to help. We tried to ask to speak to the owner 3 times and were told by reception you can but he can be quite difficult!? I'm sorry what!? We're being robbed of £180 a NIGHT for an awful room with no water!? He literally ran away and was not seen again. -The rooms weren't clean when we arrived especially the sho
"If you are a picky traveler, this hotel is not for you. The doors are old, the rooms are not exactly luxurious and the bathroom smelled very bad at night but the staff was awesome! After a long day on the beach, once we already checked out, one of the recepcionist let us take a quick shower, it was glory! If you need a place to sleep, this is okay. Right in the main avenue, you can't get lost."
 seen so we had to beg the tour guide to take our luggage and we couldn't check out. -They owed me change for hiring bikes which I never recieved. -We got up at 6:30am before our tour and the security guard seemed to be funnelling what looked like homeless children out of spare rooms at the hotel which were getting into the boot of a bashed up taxi. The children looked us in fear liked we'd caught them in the act - Very very Odd DO NOT STAY HERE it is a complete and utter rip off.
There is an horrible smelling coming from the bathroom. You have to be really courageous to go inside it. The Hotel was noisy this night. The beds are comfortable. Too expensive for the smell problem. A shame to propose it with this problem. i don't recommend. Room 14 second floor.

"Although the staff were great and tried hard it really did not live up to the description.   We booked a “suite” for eight hundred usd for three days over new year and the suite did not include a living space which is what I understood a suite to be. The suite, room fifteen, is a larger bedroom with private bathroom but apart from size no different to a standard room but with a larger bed.  Whilst there was a balcony, this was the walkway to all the rooms and so was not suitable for sitting on and there was"

" bedroom (which is a step down from the bathroom) and flooding one half of the room. The staff tried very hard to deal with it by putting towels all over the floor and by building a small wall of towels to stop further flooding, but our luggage and some clothes were wet and we could no longer shower.  During the second night there was no running water in the taps so we could not brush our teeth before bed.    On the final day the staff offered a standard room to move to which we accepted.

Not safe. Not trustworthy. Not recommended. Police came after guest reported in room theft. Below is a photo of police officer that responded to the call. This place is located in a residential area. It’s open without proper security. Anyone on the street can walk up to rooms.

Although the room door locks it can be easily open by sliding a credit card. Below is a still shoot of a video that we took to show how easily anyone can break-in by sliding a credit card.

"We stayed at the Nah for 2 nights on November 3rd and 4th 2019.  We got picked up at the airport (we are familiar with the buses, but the price of the transportation offered by the Nah was very affordable) The bus driver was there on time, we had a comfortable ride and a nice conversation; the driver speaks English.   At the Nah, the room was ready for us, the keys were provided by the security (we arrived after hours). The room was very clean and the kitchen had everything we needed to make a quick supper."
"Tulum Nah was perfect. The 1 bedroom apartment overlooking the sweet little pool, was very clean, comfortable and really well set up with everything you could need. The owners are gorgeous and are there to help out I’d needed but basically stay in the background otherwise. The small block of apartments is situated near restaurants, a BRILLIANT supermarket and not far from the beach by bicycle... which is provided free. Traveling alone, I felt very safe in this pretty haven."
"Very impressed with tulum nah apartments spacious clean kitchen even had a microwave, the pool isn’t large but is perfect for a dip after being in the ocean perfect temperature nice fluffy towels for the pool and bathroom.Salvador Theresa and Jesus were excellent hosts very helpful and kind and the best thing is the price sooo reasonable by the way Salvador I hope you had a good trip and I hope Theresa and Jesus are having a little break too ciao for now I’ll be back for sure!    "
"Salvador and Theresa were super nice and accommodating. The location was perfect for us. A little bit away from everything but close enough to easily get to. A quick bike ride to town or the ruins or the beach. And they provided the bikes at no charge, just needed to leave a deposit or your passport. Grocery store right down the road. The room was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. We will be staying here again when we go back to Tulum."
"This is an excellent hotel in Tulum. The location is perfect: within a walking distance to the grocery store and only a few minutes (bike or taxi)  to the beach. We recommended the hotel to our friend, and she stayed there with her nefew. The hotel provided them with the bikes, so we got a chance to show our friends around the town. Their room was very nice and clean. The kitchen was equipped with everything a guest might need.  We got to hang out with our friends a lot, and once they cooked us a breakfast."
"Super comfortable accommodations! Will definitely stay here next trip. Private, quiet and beautiful! I highly recommend to anyone looking to go to Tulum and not be in the crowded touristy areas but still have access to everything which is all a bike ride away. "
We had a quick 4 night stay here.  Very clean!!! Filtered water is provided! A/C worked awesome. Free bikes with a refundable deposit. Great courtyard/pool area. Right off of beach and the main roads so everything is easy to access. 5 minute walk to Chedraui for whatever shopping you need to do. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Pablo was great and Salvador has the cutest welcoming committee ever! See the pics!
Clean & modern one bedroom apartments in great location between the town and the beach. It's around 5 minute bike ride to the center and around 10 minutes to the beach.  There is also a huge supermarket two minutes from the complex.  The pool area is cool and they also have a roof top where you can soak in the sun any time of the year. They offer free bikes that are in great condition and also provide you with filtered water 24/7. Apartments are well equipped and even have a TV with Netflix!  Service here i
"Nice, comfortable, close to all attractions with very friendly and hospitable staff. Swimming pool, little park with hammocks. Free bicycles. It is close to a large supermarket and very convenient for exploring the city."
Mangle X eco was a pleasant stay for me and my wife. This eco friendly establishment was very clean with great service from all staff. Coming from a big city like NYC some would have a certain standard when going to a beach side resort. But if you would like a taste of what the local life can feel like this place will best suite your needs. Be aware this establishment uses solar energy for electricity so from morning to dusk there is absolutely no electricity available in your room. But there is a station t
" things about this resort i must say i speak HIGHLY of the concierge “Diego”. He was extremely attentive to our needs let alone everyone there. His energy when entering gives a family like feel as if you were here before. With his charm, smile and style he could easily run a 5 star hotel in NYC!! i see great things for him so keep him there and keep him happy because on my return i hope to feel the same way i am feeling while writing this."

"I am a health care worker. Had 4 nights pre-paid and booked with this resort through United Travel last March 2020. 2 Days before my scheduled travel, mandatory lock downs were implemented and my work required that I do not do International travel. I called United airlines and United Travel to cancel due to the pandemic, I was credited my full airline ticket but United Travel told me they tried to contact the hotel and did not get through. The day following my check-in date, I got an email from the hotel st"

"This place, like all of Tulum, takes your breath away! the pathway to your room is a wooden archway, and you feel like you're in a fairy land (especially at night).  It's a great place to settle in for your trip with bikes that you can use for free to bike through the town or go to the wildlife reserve with the most amazing virgin beaches!   There's a cenote at the back of the property that you can kayak or paddle, but it's best enjoyed by swimming! We snorkeled from the property to a restaurant just a coup"
We had a spontaneous over night trip to Tulum during our Cancun trip and was scrambling to find a last minute accommodation. We found this place and knew this was just the perfect place for us. If you’re an environmentally cautious person and enjoy simple hospitality as if you were staying at your grandma’s place then this is the perfect place for you! We stayed in one of their bungalows which is literally above the mangroves so you are really in nature. It is also very quiet and peaceful. Just a relaxing e
"I recently stayed here for the first time and can say this probably won't be my last. The eco-friendly hotel was unique and felt primitive with with a few luxuries to make your stay comfortable. The main areas of Tulum were a short drive away but the location of the hotel allowed it to feel remote and private. The cabins are secluded, surrounded by trees, water, and even have a cenote in the back. If you're looking to stay near the bustle of Tulum, but still have an peaceful escape into nature, these cabins"
"My partner and I decided to spend a few nights in Manglex for our aniversary trip, and I am so glad we did! It is a beautiful place, connected to nature. It is so peaceful and quiet, it felt like a perfect place to connect with my girl.  It has a beautiful cenote in the back. The best way to enjoy it is to ask for some paddle boards to the front desk and chill on them while you watch the sunset. Then you can open a bottle of wine and get cozy watching the stars. This place is a bit far away from all the noi"
"Everything seemed ok until we went to bed and the noise from across the street was unbearable. Music blasted each night until 4am. You could feel the bass in your body and hear the music, even with earplugs in. We asked to move to another room but this wasn't possible.   The owners started out friendly but quickly became extremely rude and defensive. For our last few nights they offered us earplugs and money to go out but we were exhausted from the lack of sleep (and didn't really want to stay our until 4am"

"The owner promised me to send an invoice. He didn't. I was writing 3 e-mails and calling them in Mexico - they promised me to send this time - really. After almost 4 weeks later I am still waiting for the document, which I need. This is really disappointing!   The room was ok, but the neighbor was doing some renovations and it was really noisy and hard to find sleep.   NO MORE - GRACIAS !"
We stayed at this cute little hotel for four days over the new year period. It was fantastic. We had a spacious room on the ground floor which had everything that we required. Would certainly recommend this hotel. We arrived late in the evening and the owner was still on site to welcome us and show us to our allocated room. The female owner was also extremely helpful with information about places to visit etc whilst in Tulum. The hotel was located within the centre of Tulum which was ideal for us 
This is where you want to come to relax and enjoy Tulum. Close to the Main Street and a short taxi to everything. But what makes this a standout are the innkeepers. They are a lovely couple with great personalities and big hearts. Will definitely stay here again. 
We stayed 1 night in Centro Tulum and happy that we stayed here! The hotel has interesting colors and character and is nestled into a very busy central Tulum. Our room was perfect and comfortable and the hotel managers were very friendly and provided great recommendations for places to dine. We're very very happy to have stayed here!!
"This is a quaint family run hotel. The lack of a room safe is offset by the fact that the owner keeps watch over the courtyard from his office . It was a good value for the price.  It is a short walk to the main street in tulum.  Check the schedule of the fairgrounds across the street. We were kept awake until midnight by an obnoxiously loud concert in the park, and we noticed that the amusement rides were setting up there the morning of our departure. Otherwise quiet. There was no dresser in our room so we"
"Right after I registered, I got an email from hotels.com with 3 questions. I responded that the hotel was pretty and the reception fine but that the hotel had been hard for me to find and I couldn't see any restaurants or anything nearby. True, it is only 4 blocks from the main drag, but for me it wasn't easy to find. There was a lot of dusty construction and the road seemed to lead nowhere. The hotel sign was obscured by a big tree and the front of the hotel seemed like a wall of twigs. The owner seems to "

"We stayed at Nativus Glamping because the prices in Tulum were crazy, and we were looking for something more authentic. I am so glad we found this place. Nativus Glamping is an oasis of peace, with a stunning private cenote in the ‘backyard’, and the loveliest staff. Staying in the glamping tents was comfortable; clean and no animals, comfortable bed, fans and a complete bathroom in the open air which also added to the magical experience. Nativus is in the South-end of the beach, which is more relaxed, with"

Then she helped me by calling every hospital in Cancun, until she arranged an appointment for me, which I could never have done on my own (not speaking Spanish).

To me, a person like her in such a moment is priceless! She (and her dog) brings a smile on your face every day wi"

I won’t recommend this hotel if you are looking security and trust.  I really had a bad experience during my staying in this hotel. I missed one of my belongings and they never made responsible or checked with their staff. Not serious business.
"We were supposed to stay at Nativus from January 1st - January 4th.  Upon checking in, I noticed the signs and waiver form saying if our belongings were to go missing during our stay it would not be at the responsibility of Nativus even if our things were stolen from our room. I asked the attendant about this and he said well your room is already fully paid and I was provided with a tiny lock and a key. Which is better than nothing, but when there is a hole in the side of our tent and the windows only Velcr"
The hotel is a beautiful gem in Tulum. Small boutique hotel feeling with great and friendly staff. The rooms are beautifully decorated  The pool area it’s cozy with little palapas where you can relax away from the busy larger hotels  I definitely recommend you looking into this place for a relaxing stay close to many Tulum attractions
"Overpriced junk  I wish what happened at the end didn’t happen. I was about to be charged $900 pesos for the mini bar!! 2 waters, 2 sodas, 3 small small bags of chips.  They were overcharging me for items that were Not in my room. And When i told them they changed the bill! So we’re they stealing from me or trying to?!?! I ended up paying $600pesos ($30usd)  for what would have been $5usd.  They were rude to me as well when questioning them. There were so many workers but no one was doing anything it seemed"
"At the reception the young personelle was treating everyone so well. Also, we asked for a room with a pool view and they offered it. If you need a hairdryer or iron you'll have to ask for them in the reception and return them once you are done using them. The pool is nice, however umbrellas are missing.  The only unpleasant thing was that we were trying to check out one night before and we were not given any money back, however this did not affect our oppinion on the property."
 the website and booking confirmation.  Our room smelled of sewage and the “eco-friendly” bathroom meant that the sewage from the toilet was going directly onto the ground below/behind our tent. The bathroom is extremely unsafe and has uneven boards and exposed nailheads someone could step on while using the bathroom. The shower water also smells bad like a swamp.  The last straw was when I saw a large cockroach in our room. Because of this experience we left Nativus the same evening we checked in on Januar
"Caribena is absolutly beautiful and welcoming, telaxing place to be in Tulum surrounded with many excelent restarants, so charming with its invating Pool area with beautiful sun beds, reel Caribean feeling.

"The hotel is located in the pueblo area of tulum, 5km out the beach. If you have a car its totally fine. The hotel has a Bali vibe, very clean and beautiful. Staff is great. Price is good. It’s a good choice for a more affordable stay in tulum, if you are not looking to stay beach front.  The only negative was breakfast. I don’t recommend you get it. It’s a la carte and only includes coffe OR juice and scrambled eggs. Anything else you have to pay. There are a great variety of coffee shops and restaurants s"
"Since you're looking for a hotel ........................ ""I'd stay here again.""  My 'reservations' reflect my own priorities, which might not be yours.  Mainly that we wanted a hotel with a pool.  Wish Tulum has one, and it's nice.  But they have no shade, nor umbrella's, nor overhangs, so we could only stop at it briefly, on the way to and from our room.  Couldn't 'hang out' at the pool.  Our room had no cabinets, dressers, shelves, so storage/unpacking was a challenge.  Bathroom is really small.  Tulum T"

"I stayed with my sister for 2 weeks in this beautiful hotel. Great location in La Veleta and amazing staff. Everyone is so friendly, the rooms are perfectly clean and the bed was very comfortable. Awesome pool where you can hang out on days you don't wanna go to the beach.  I would definitely come back. If you are looking for a quite and relaxing place, this is it."
"I booked a 3 night stay at the Strabon for a solo trip and ultimately decided to cancel my entire trip due to a shooting in the Tulum downtown area that killed two tourists, and injured 3 others. Since I was travelling by myself I was concerned for my safety. The Strabon would not refund me or even offer a credit for a future stay. I am extremely disappointed with their lack of compassion and understanding and when I do eventually make it to Tulum, I will NOT give any business to them."
" (which I find very important), staff is very helpful.  Found Wish Tulum to be a pleasant and cost effective stay."
"We did not like the place at all. We booked it because we wanted to be in nature and in silence, and we had the noise of a  restaurant near by with loud music. We went to had a swim in the centote and some people (not guests that had pay $3 for a day pass) had taken the place and were had taken ovrto have a party, with alcohol (you were supposed not to take that to the cenote) plus loud music and one of the guys even peeing in front of us. When we repported it, they just asked the guys to turn the music dow"

It's located in a quiet location, just 5 minutes from downtown and 15 from the beach by car. I spent a couple of nights with my friends and I will definetly be returning as soon as I can. It is tastefully decorated, the beds are comfy, and it has a pool that is perfect for just after a full day by the beach, or even to take one last swim before checki"
"If you want to stay in Tulum at a place that has terrible WiFi, power outages, NO hot water, no ice machines, No swept floors in the room..Then this is place for you!!! The 2 stars is for the staff, as they were as friendly and as accommodating as they could be."

"Cute boutique hotel with spacious room and bathroom. Lots of plants and greenery were a very nice touch.  The hotel is located about a 7-8 minutes bike ride from downtown, so to have good, well-maintained bikes as a part of hotel amenities would be a HUGE plus!  Budget-friendly, especially for Tulum!"
"We stayed a couple of days. 1st, the staff was very nice and from the arrival until the departure everything has been perfectly done.  2nd, the room itself was nice & clean, perfectly matching with the description.  3rd, you get access to the pool which was clean & definitely not full of people as the hotel remain small 4th, the location of the hotel is excellent to be enough closed to everything (city center, bike shop, diving shop, travel agencies, supermarket, ect...) 5th, the restaurant el capitan next "
"This hotel had a very good cost/benefit. Location 10/10 right next to ADO station and very close to restaurants and stores of Tulum Center. Hotel is EXTREMELY clean (I’m a clean freak and this was above expectations), hotel and room were always smelling good, air conditioning working perfectly and very spacious room. Also they provide coffee, microwave and the room has a mini fridge, which is good if you want to make small meals/snacks in the room."

We have been there for only 4 days, but the stay was amazing and we really didn't want it to end. If you are afraid of staying and sleeping in tent, you shouldn't! Bed was really comfy, tent had everything what you need including air fan, to decrease the temperature. Bathroom in the fresh air under beautiful sky was terrific. Nature on the glamping ar"

 beautiful boutique hotel! 
"Staff was approachable, friendly, and  helpful, especially Eduardo, the night security guard. It's a tranquil little oasis, in spite of the fact that it's on the main road. A bit far from the beach (not walking distance), but close to the supermarket and 7/11.  El Capitan, the restaurant attached to it is very convenient, and also has very friendly staff. Food is not bad and affordable. I would stay here again."
"Amazing place for breakfast, yoga, and working remotely from the room. Paola is an awesome host and has a very special oasis in la valeta. Close to a couple great spots to eat and very helpful with other things to make the most of your experience. It was quiet there, which was exactly what i was looking for in the 5 nights I stayed. Great staff as well, would definitely come come back!"

At the end of the main street. Coming out of the bus station there is a little fence on the right site. Behind that fence are a door and stairs leading to the hotel. Personnel very nice, not speaking much English (except for the owner) but absolutely willing to try. Very clean. Big room. Shower with hot water and good p"

"It literally states there won’t be any type of flexibility including war, terrorism, much less if your flight cancels, you would just be out of luck...

But definitely staying anywhere else when travel dates goes according to plan. "
"We, as a family of four (two young kids), absolutely loved it here! Of course, Tulum by itself is a really interesting and fun chilling place. But this hotel and her owner (Paula) have made it much more fun and enjoyable than without.  Every morning they organize Yoga (with absolutely great teachers) and their breakfast and juices are really good! If you visit Tulum you have to stay at this hotel because then you experience the love and relaxation that have made this town a must visit in the first place :) "

The location is good, close to downtown and restaurants but still in a quiet place. We would always come back!"

"Firstly, the apartment itself if absolutely fine.  Good size, clean and in a quiet location out of town. So the reason for my 1* review is not for that, but for misleading/dishonest marketing and the management response (or lack thereof) to my complaint.  When looking for somewhere to stay in Tulum we were deliberating between town and beach locations.  Coco Village seemed ideal - a town location but with ""free access"" to their sister property on the beach.  (Note, at the time of booking this free access wa"

On arrival, it transpired that free access actually means a minimum spend of 25 USD per person (since there were 4 of us, 100 USD seems quite a lot for a day at the beach!).

Anyway my point is, if you’re not happy with something it’s good customer service to take it off the bill, yet I paid for BOTH meals. I also saw other people leave full plates of nachos. Just something to take into consideration. Everything else was fine. The manager/ owner was super helpful with recommendations f"

"We visited the beach club of Cinco for 1 day, and let me tell you, I wish we would’ve discovered it sooner. The vibe is super relaxed, the music is perfect, the staff was incredibly nice and HAPPY HOUR(!). Yeah we’re totally sold. We’ve been to another beach club in tulum which was 4x as expensive and I wish we would’ve known about Cinco then. Perfect, you have to go!!"
Spent the afternoon here.. Good food.. Good service.. Had lunch thenoved to beach chairs for a swim and cocktails... Was very clean and had parking for our designated driver.. Cold beer and hot food on a beautiful beach.. Wish we could have stayed longer..
"Great vibes, delicious food, perfect drinks, no minimum. What more could you want? Skip the beach clubs in the hotel zone and come here instead. Shout out to Brett (one of the owners) for pulling up an extra little table for us when our food arrived. Him and his partners have clearly put a lot of love into this spot. Don’t miss it!"
"Cinco is a small, relaxed beach club with fresh, delicious food (try the fish tacos and the homemade sorbet) and well-mixed cocktails that is in the relatively quieter north Beach Road area. There was chill music playing, but not the loud dance club music of other locations, so it made for a relaxing environment. We appreciated that we could make a reservation via their website -- definitely do this!! -- and that parking was available onsite. The service was attentive without being overbearing. We reserved "
" with lunch and drinks.   For people considering staying here overnight, I really enjoyed our day here, but I would not have enjoyed staying here overnight. The glamping tents looked nicely furnished, but were very closely spaced with limited privacy. I think it would be comfortable if you're just looking for a place to rest, but not the best choice for couples or if you are looking for quiet space."
…
"Cinco Tulum is a chill and beautiful place that can be visited as a beach club by day or ""glamping"" guest (which includes the beach club). During my 4 days in Tulum, I decided to spend two nights inland, followed by 2 nights near the ocean. I had never been glamping and chose this popular spot. Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the concierge, a delicious tropical drink, given a tour of the property, my tent, amenities and basic beach club rules/regulations. It's along the hotel zone, so it's nestled be"
"Loved my three week stay here. Very clean, spacious rooms and consistent air conditioning.   The breakfast isn't enormous, but its really lovely. I also loved the staff, they always took great care of me and really tried to communicate with my broken spanish.   The location is PHENOMENAL. Right by tons of great restaurants and halfway between the beach road and the La Valera area which is the other good spot in town. "
"We looked in Tulum for hotel with reasonable prices. This small B&B is on a perfect location just outside the main bars and cafe’s in the street. Arrival was done by a very friendly woman from Argentina and she helped and advised us the entire stay. Bikes are for rent next door and you need them to go to the beach. Public beaches are the best near to the park. On the hotel site is it to expensive and difficult to lay down. In this place we ordered breakfast each day in our room, but you can chose to eat it "
" got this information at checkin. Tulum is very Nice, but expensive for Mexico in our opinion. It looks like the new Ibiza of south America. Prices are on European level. Tip for the hotel. Curtains could be more black-out. It is very bright light in the room. Building is very beautifull with different sorts of business together and all staf(night, room attendents and reception) were friendly and helpfull. We enjoyed and can highly recommend! Thanks al lot. "
…
"Positive comments: The room is spacious, clean and comfortable. The location is good, is close to many restaurants and convenience stores. The breakfast is good, and the presentation was excellent. Negative aspects: The service was basic and not kind. At the moment of our arriving, they only provided our keys and not explain anything about staying. The parking is beside the hotel but you need to go with your keys and open the big doors with a chain and lock on it, is totally unpractical. If you have a rente"
" something simple, also he wasn´t capable to research about to provide another answer. Finally, we listened to the cleaning staff to complain and make disgusting comments about going to clean the rooms. She didn´t know we were beside her and didn´t expect that we were guests from the hotel. Was unprofessional and distasteful."

"It’s an amazing place to stay. Average price per night around 40$ ish. They have nice staff and they have breakfast, fast wifi, pretty clean nice environment. It’s heart of the downtown, close anywhere..."
"We found this hotel at a reasonable price. 2195 pesos for 3 nights.   Rooms perfect and clean. Good water pressure. Rooms with garden view, really nice.   Very noisy in the night. I think is a common problem in Tulum as there is loud music every single day until 5am. I have to say, after I fell sleep, I slept straight all night.   Breakfast: eggs, hot cakes, bananas and apples, some muesli, coffee and tea. Very tasty.   Water in reception so you can refill your bottles.   Nice tv but we didn't watch it. You"
 didn't seem to care much.   100% recommended! 😊
"The worst hotel we have ever been!! Staff is stilling money from your deposit inside the room, we lost $200 dolars, our friends over 1000$, nobady care!!  Do NOT book this place!! Bar at the poll area closed, despite info from the hotel that is open, no laundry service, around is very noisy, many construction sides, be awere!! "
"This hotel did not meet our expectations as a couple traveling to Tulum- which wasn't our first time to Tulum but we wanted to try a new hotel. The room was very small compared to what was displayed online as well as the bathroom.   Before booking this hotel I had emailed the hotel and they had told me that bike rentals were included in our rate so we didn't have to worry about renting bikes, only  to find out that not only were there no free bikes but they didn't have any bikes available for us to rent. So"
" cleaning our room they seemed to have forgotten to lock the door which is VERY unsafe as we have our personal belongings in there. We got back from a night out and were terrified thinking someone had broken into our room.   The rooms aren't insulated so you can hear your neighbors and people in the hallway which is inconvenient & noisy,   Overall I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it. There are other better boutique hotels in downtown Tulum. Please do you research and don't make the mistake we d"
…
"Really appreciated that the hotel is centrally located and isn’t gated and sequestered from the local people of Tulum. During our stay, the staff was awesome, they were welcoming and helpful and we really enjoyed the space. Thank you Zendero!"
"I spend 3 nights here and I loved it.  The staff members were great and helped me and answered every question I had, giving me great advice.  Hotel is clean, nice, walking distance to many restaurants, and I even walked from the beach twice (about 40 minutes depending on where).  My only complain was that on my last morning (the breakfast is the best I've had included in the fee) I had to leave the hotel at 8 am to go to Cancun airport, and breakfast started at 7:30am.  I had figured I had enough time to at"
" kitchen.  I ended up leaving without anything and I was very unhappy on my hour and a half trip to Cancun without haven't had any coffee.  This is not the server's, cook's, or group's fault per se, but, the hotel is small, and for breakfast they can usually accommodate one order at a time.  If the hotel knows they are checking in a group of 17 people, couldn't they also make special arrangements for them to have breakfast at a certain hour?  I am pretty sure no one else in the hotel was able to get anythin"
…
The hotel is nicely done. The room was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was great. The location is walkable to restaurants and stores. Only negative is the construction surrounding the hotel.
"Zendero is in a great location in proxy to main strip of restaurants, bars etc. The street its located on its in the middle of development so constant construction during the day. Sits on an unfinished road. Aesthetically the venue is gorgeous and beautiful landscape however, it lacks considerably in customer service. There is no elevator. I had to climb multiple flights of stairs with multiple heavy luggage. The safe in my room was inoperable. My first day there was no electricity or running water for hour"
Very hospitable hosts who gave great recommendations for exploring the town and getting reliable transportation on a budget. Rooftop is beautiful! Could use a blanket on beds in addition to sheets. The cruiser bikes they offer were really accessible  and made for an awesome excursion day.
"I literally never write reviews. The staff at Casa Almendro went above and beyond to make sure my boyfriend and I were able to celebrate a special occasion in style. They clearly take a lot of pride in their work. The rooftop is gorgeous and the rooms are very comfortable. Excellent location, daily cleaning of rooms, and great service."
"Great tents/bungalows with lots of space inside. Comfortable, with AC, clean and an amazing outdoor shower! Small hotel with only 8 tents so it is not busy and it's silent and quiet. Amazing staff and owner. Local people to whom you can great conversations. The restaurant is also high quality and their staff is young and really trying to deliver a great service. Food is really good! Located on the main avenue of Tulum. It is basically on the end of the city coming from Playa del Carmen. So you can go to the"
"Good value is difficult to find in Tulum. This is one such place. Well located. Very clean. Well equipped kitchen. The staff is nice & attentive and will help you to rent a bike if you need one.  Plenty of food options nearby and two cheap laundries. If I get a chance I will come back. I stayed in a basic room, no TV which worked for me. Bathroom small but functional. "
"We stayed at Huaya camp for three nights and everything was perfect. The style and architecture are great and so are the tents. Everything is totally clean. We also really enjoyed the breakfast and smoothies, they were very delicious. And also the owner and his stuff were extremly nice and friendly and helpful with tips for our stay in Tulum. I highly recommend Huaya Camp! "
"Casa Almendro is a small, cozy and beautiful guest house, just a walking distance from tulum main avenue. Grocery stores, restaurants and food wagons are at a 1 minute walking distance.  The place is super clean. It has a beautiful roof with hammocks, tables and a shared kitchen with all the equipment that is needed in order to cook a meal. The rooms are perfect for 4 people and they even add one more bed for us no extra charge (we are five). The hosts are very helpful and kind and we would definitely love "
"My husband and I just stayed here for a week and absolutely loved it. We went for our 3 year wedding anniversary and the hotel kindly put romantic flowers and a message on our bed which was very thoughtful. Beautiful and clean rooms... and a SUPER comfy bed. I’m confused about previous reviews on the breakfast because we thought it was great. It had a variety of eggs, bread, fruits, juice, cakes and jams. Delicious! And finally the staff were amazing, kind, polite, gave great recommendations on restaurants."
"I got a recommendation to stay here, I was excited based on the photos. It's not as secluded as it looks in the photos, it's roadside with club music and traffic visible in the tents. They double-charged me for the room and I had to follow up for weeks (7 emails total) for them to finally reverse the charge. For the cost, there are much better places to stay in Tulum."
"Really nice place. You will certainly like it.  Calm, no party place with proximity to everything.  Nice staff and owners. Well kept and clean.  Lovely roof terrace. No pool or pool area.   Well worth a visit! "
"I spent lots of time finding the perfect place to stay downtown Tulum and I usually use Trip Advisor to make my choice but I’ve found this place on another website.  I don’t know why there is not more reviews on here because this place is just perfect! It was everything I was looking for.  First of all it is spotless, super clean.  The owner and the staff were retouching the paint the two days we were there. You can tell they put there hearts into this hotel.  Talking about the staff, everyone is friendly a"
"Great place, no complaints about property. Staff very helpful trough stay. Pool is smallish but adequate for family. Free breakfast does not include egg or meat but made up for it with fresh fruit and fresh fruit juice, and different pastry every day.  Coffee was ok, not bad. Milk was good for family. I assume that the kitchen could be used for eggs etc. presuming we clean up after ourselves.  Room toiletries were of very good quality. Tv is a bit dated (tube) but worked well. Balcony is a little treat, not"
My boyfriend and I stayed at Camp Huaya in Tulum and had the BEST time! The grounds are darling and the yurts are even better! The cuteness is only matched by the loveliness of the staff! This includes Lalo (the camp owner) who is fabulous! He is so hospitable and has the best Tulum recommendations! We can’t say enough good things about this place! 
" Everywhere you go there is construction, dogs barking, people partying. I didn’t sleep the first night because dogs were barking next to the hotel and a rooster woke me up early morning but thats not the hotels fault.  There is air conditioning and a fan in the room so you have the choice which one you prefer.  What I loved the most about this hotel is the rooftop terrace.  It is so nice and relaxing with a nice refreshing breeze where you can escape the heat.  We spent our afternoon in the hamac and it wa"
" the $ rate  Recommend: yes stay here, even with kids"
"The staff of this place is absolutely amazing. They are very willing to help you out in any matter. We wanted to rent a scooter and in 20 mins it was delivered to our doorstep. Next day we wanted to rent a car and it was delivered once again to our doorstep. Additionally, the rooms were clean and had an amazing atmosphere. Initially I was a bit anxious about staying in a yurt since I had never stayed in one before but once we arrived my worries were proven to be unnecessary. "

"If you are looking for a quiet romantic getaway - this is the spot.  We spend 3 nights in Huaya camp. The place succeeds in both generating that restful palm tree oasis feel, but at the same time looks both fancy and very stylish! The staff here will truly make you feel welcome, with hospitality beyond words. The in-house Kalu restaurant serves healthy and tasty food that will definitely make you feel happy and cosy. The staff is so attentive they even remember how you like your morning coffee. Lalo, the ow"
"This small hotel was perfect for us. We had 2 rooms...one with 2 double beds for our 18 and 21 yr old sons, and one King for me and my wife. It was a great base for us as we spent the week enjoying Tulum. We had a car to get around the area, so that made it easy to get to and from town and also over to the main beach road, where the sister hotel and beach club was an ideal spot to relax. Very nice staff in both locations, they made us very welcome and comfortable. Even if we did not have a car, taxis are ab"
"The Huaya Eco Camp Yurts is a nice and quiet oasis right along the big and bussie road crossing Tulum. This place turned out to be my hub for having most tasty breakfast, to meeting very nice people from all over the world, to enjoying awesome smoothies and to join great trips with Lalo to the surrounding highlights of Tulum. The personal was very friendly, vigilant und welcoming. I can only recommend this place to enjoy your time at Tulum!"
"We stayed for two nights at Luna Llena Tulum and was the worst hotel of all our journey through Quintana Roo.  Initially a hotel far from everything. We had car and it was still very far. The street of the hotel with many big holes and very difficult to use. We did not even check in and check out. Simply, the security guy gave us the room key and we never saw the reception girl.  Reasonable room. We stayed in the third floor. No elevator. Very difficult to take the suitcases to room. Small bed and bad. My b"
"A charming little paradise in.the crowded and exciting town Tulum. The yurts are wonderful and very stylish... Showering under the stars is delightful! Ask the owner for a journey to the nearby lagoon and Maya ruins (or any other trip), if you're lucky he'll take a Maya guide with him... A great storyteller that knows the history and nature very well! And ask the owner to take you to his favourite fish restaurant for lunch afterwards...   It's not cheap but worth every penny!"
" Maria del Mar, in the Tulum Beach. But there's lots of Beach Clubs in the beautiful Paraiso Beach.  Anyway, I don't recommend. A careless hotel, terrible brakfast, terrible bed, very far from everything and practically without any service."
"My Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Pepem. We stayed in the Na-Ha Suite. It was even more beautiful than the photos! Upon arrival, we were greeted and checked in in a lovely check in area that is located next to the restaurant. All staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. Quick to answer any questions we had. We were given a quick tour of our suite and then left to relax in the peace and tranquility of the jungle.  The suite had a full working kitchen with a large refrigerator. We ha"
Huaya camp is truly incredible! The vibes are so fun yet chill. The decor is perfect and I felt completely comfortable in every way. It is really heavenly! The food is amazing and so affordable. Great service- Lalo and Julio were so sweet and attentive! Amazing value and just one of the best experiences I’ve ever had!

 doors on all sides of the shower to provide privacy while still being able to view the outside from indoors.  The living area and bedroom were beautifully decorated and comfortable. They provided us a fan for sleeping at night. It was of course warm and humid but made bearable with the fan and keeping the glass doors open at night (there are screened doors to keep out bugs) for a nice breeze. We slept well all three nights.  We ate at the restaurant on two nights of our stay. The atmosphere is lovely and t

"Arrival/Welcome Staff: Superb. Enthusiastic. Friendly. Room: Very nicely decorated, nice space. Big window. Amenities: Lame pool area, no room to sit. No sun.  Restaurant: Breakfast included with the room is very basic. Almost 100% sugar-based items.  Location: Absolutely brutal. There are about 10 hotels under construction in the vicinity, it is loud from 7am until 9pm (non-stop). Not relaxing at all. Also, it is a good 25mins walk to the strip, there are barely any lights, and the roads are disastrous. Ma"

Superb perk... yours to decide what's more important!"
"Can’t say enough great things about Pepem. Me and my partner stayed with them in a jungle suite w pvt pool. And omg it was just perfect! In addition, the staff at the property (literally everyone) are the kindest and sweetest people ever. They made us feel at home since the moment we stepped in. The property is the core definition of boho chic, the restaurant is a must try - sea and land pasta and mezcalitas were our faves. There’s also always some events happening at the property that are very special, we "
"Everything about this property was Simply perfect!    What surprise us the most was the quality of the food and the chef! His name is Martin and he managed to surprise us with delicious food every day. Before spending 4 nights at this location, we stayed 5 nights in Tulum (Hotel area) and tried several fancy restaurants and still the food at Pepem was the most outstanding!  I honestly think Martin should be considered for at least one Michelin  star ;) . The restaurant itself has a very cosy & tasteful deco"
" private & safe environment.We visited this place in April 2022 and the weather outside was rather warm. This is an Eco Hotel and it does not have AC. However during the night it was very comfortable as we had two fans that we could use. We come from Denmark and prefer cold rooms when sleeping :) Two ventilation fans did the job and we had no problems sleeping.   There is also very beautiful mosquito cover we use during the night. However, we did not have any issues with mosquitoes as there were not so many"

We slept like a babies,it’s so relaxing and the cabin was so beautiful and unique designed ,we really like it. Compare to all overpriced placed in Tulum especially zona hoteleria this place was cheap and worth every peso! The staff were extremely nice and friendly and the cook was professional who perfected every dish!  10+ from us!"
"What a wonderful little place. We were lucky enough to stay in the family size Cabana for one night. Wish we could stay longer! It was so peaceful and everything was perfect and so beautifully done. There is no air conditioner, only fans, but the weather was great so it did not bother us. Dinner was available at the onsite restaurant. The food was delicious! Breakfast included homemade bread.  We followed directions on google maps and it had us drive on a road that is no longer used (glad we persevered and "

It was close to a supermarket, the city center, the highways to Chichen Itza and Playa Del Carmen, Playa Paraiso, a gas station, and the best restaurants we tried (which the staff recommended to us)."

"While not easy to find, Casa Mango is well worth the effort, if you find yourself already staying in the area. While we did not stay there, we had several Italian dinners among the lush foliage, and the food is fresh, tasty, and good variety. (The wine is good too.) Affordable, unpretentious, yet romantic. The hosts are very friendly and genuine. What more could one want, deep in La Selva??"
"I recommend this place! They do like to party so if you’re trying to relax and sleep this might not be the place for you.  Everyone was nice and friendly! Rooms were super clean! Also, very central location."
"Pros: Breakfast is decent for being ""free"" (apples, eggs which you can cook yourself, basic cereal and milk, coffee, sugar, white bread, marmalade, and butter). Free drinking water which has been pre-boiled and cooled. Shared bathrooms are spacious and pretty clean considering the traffic. I enjoyed the natural-like setting among urbanized Tulum. Just to the left is Ola Bike which is a major bike rental company in the area, very convenient! The hostel also rents out bikes but they only have like 2 or 4 so t"

" retrospect so maybe it was just me. There is only a tiny shelf inside that runs the length of the bed horizontally so your backpack and luggage will likely have to squeeze under the bed. It's pretty hot and muggy in the area so you have to blast the AC and be freezing (you only get a thin sheet for the bed, no real blanket), or put up with a humid room. No place to hang items dry.

Maka is really well located in Tulum town close to many great restaurants and right by the main road that leads to the beach. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are all so friendly & accommodating! We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back/recommend Maka to friends!
"Loved this place. Beautiful, affordable, quiet, cats, hammocks, tubes, staff, location, ambiance. Not a party hostel, which I really liked about it. No booze allowed, which helps keep things mellow. Clean bathrooms, awesome AC. Loved it all. "
Someone that works there with the keys for the rooms went through our stuff while we were out and stole money from our luggages.  Management denied.  We lost 200 pounds.  Don't book this place. There is no safe in the rooms and apparently cleaning services like to check what's going on in your belongings.

Als wir bezahlen wollten, sagten sie uns, dass eine Überbuchung vorliegt und wir leider nur ein paar Tage bleiben können. Die größte Frechheit war, dass wir pro Nacht mehr Geld als vereinbart bezahlen mussten, da wir nicht so lange dort blieben.  Viel Stress und unnötiger Aufwand. Ansonsten war es sehr hellhörig und laut und die Zimmer habe"

We had a great stay at Irie Tulum. We were just passing through Tulum and were really lucky to find this place. We didn´t want to leave. The hotel is brand new and the beds were amazing. I slept like a baby. The restaurant was great. The cocktails were especially enjoyable :)
 sensitive to loud music would have problems going to sleep early.

The staff are friendly enough and it's only 2 blocks from the ADO terminal and half a block to the main street and collectivo stop. Shower was good and had enough place for your clothes and bags.  Downside was the internet which stopped out often till they reset it then it worked better.

"I can't say enough about my stay at Irie.  It far exceeded my expectations!  From my beautiful penthouse apartment, to the 5 star cuisine, to the all of the upscale amenities, and to the kind, attentive staff - if I could give 10 stars I would.  My penthouse apartment was fully stocked with all of the necessities. It was luxurious and clean with an authentic Tulum vibe.  I stayed on the jungle side of the hotel and had views for days of the beautiful lush canopy.  My apartment had a breathtaking rooftop ter"

"Yes, it has hot water. Pressure is a tad low. Clean place, but do not plan to pay with a credit card, as they are not set up to accept cards unless you used a credit card to guarantee the room. Then they will defer to that payment.. Price is OK. They advertise free parking. Yes, that is kind of true, as the parking is in front on the city street if you can get it. The area is a dimly lit side street. Beds are fine. Do not expect a Holiday Inn or even a Motel 6. This is pretty much your entry level place. Go"
 every meal there because it was like eating at a 5 star restaurant.  The food was always beautifully plated and the menu had such diverse offerings. Bon appetite!  The amenities had me never wanting to leave!  The beautiful pool located right in the middle of the hotel property was so relaxing and chill.  Talk about feeling like you're on vacation!  The gym is a full service gym with every piece of equipment that you could possibly need.  Professional weight lifters would die for this gym.  But the most sp
"My family of 4 stayed in 2 rooms at the Posada Malix Pek recently on our way through to Mahahual. It was a little hard to find and not in the best looking neighborhood. I was concerned when we pulled up to the place at night, but I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the room. Very clean and recently updated rooms. Nice, comfortable beds and very nice bathrooms with great showers. It was all we needed for 1 night. I will say that the staff is not very friendly, but the man on duty did help with our lug"
"I enjoyed the interaction with staff, smiling and kind people, all three who were at the reception when I was there.  The room was simple, and most important, clean.  I struggled with my sleep though, because of two reasons: There was a lot of noice from outside, as the tiny window was facing the busy street. But there was no glass window, just a mesh, which made it worse. Also there was some water noise running constantly from the pipes, like the toilet upstairs was being flushed constantly.  Should it not"
"For the price this place is fine. Don't expect anything fancy. Super basic. But the wifi works and the place feels safe. Right near an amazing taco place, which is right on the main street. For a low price for a night or two this place is fine. "
"I actually didn't stay a the hotel , as I became sick and ask them for the cancellation. They gave me full refund, though it was las t minute cancellation. This is the indication that they are very good."
"We stayed here for 5 nights and had a basic room, double bed with aircon. The aircon worked fine and the room was small but enough. A small window to the outside and a bigger facing the hall outside. If you're claustrofobic this CAN be an issue, especially if you get one of the room where all the windows only facing a corridor. It's a little bit of feeling being inside a cell... because of this a few paintings on the walls hadn't hurt to make it feel more ""cozy"".   The door to the toilet was broken and wasn"
"After waking around for 2 hours, we found this great little hotel on a side street, we thought we went to heaven it's so clean and the staff is very friendly and again a little bit of noise at night but if it's the only bad about this place it's not that bad, would love to stay there again when visiting the region"
" or just relax outside the room a little bit!   The staff was very friendly but didn't seem to know so much about the area, this would be awesome as well to improve! The hotel is very close to the ADO station and is located near to almost everything you need - except for the beach ;)"
…
We stayed 4 nights after a horrible hostel experience in Tulum and it was just what we needed. REALLY clean and the WIFI is running fast. Also the staff is amazingly friendly and A/C is working good. The location is perfect. It’s not on the main street so not loud and you have all the restaurants by 5 minutes walk.
This hotel can now be booked under the name of ruta del sol. I stayed here a couple of nights and had a good stay. The location is great in central Tulum and just a few steps from the ADO bus station . The employees are very welcoming and please to help you out with just info or tours.   The WiFi is perfect and available in the whole hotel.   The room is big enough and the bed sleeps fine. My room had ac and a ceiling fan. The latter was for me enough though.  Room is cleaned every day and also new towels i
"I stayed here with my wife for 10 days. Rooms are very clean and well maintained, with plenty of space. Location is great, near ADO bus station and great taco place.  Personel was very kind. Overall, we had a wonderful time here."
"A great place to stay in town- wonderful food (think tacos tacos tacos) right on the corner. Room was large and comfortable. It was the perfect home base for our Tulum trip. Lots of places to rent bikes nearby and just a 20min bike ride to a beautiful, perfect, not crowded public beach."
"Este hotelito trae toda la onda! El cuarto esta muy lindo, la cama super cómoda, el roof tiene la mejor vista del atardecer, ademas la ubicacion es excelente porque se encuentra caminando de bares, restaurantes y beach clubs. Lo mejor de todo fue la atencion de todos, Dante es el mejor host! No duden en hospedarse aqui, es una excelente opcion calidad-precio."
"First time staying here, further down the strip on the quieter end. Set back from the road. No sign from the street so you need to know where you are going. it's located where you see the LOCO TULUM restaurant. Very large rooms, large bed and bathroom, and small rooftop dipping pool. On the Jungle side, the rooftop has a beautiful view of greenery for miles. doesn't feel like you are at the beach anymore. Jungle vibes. Attentive staff, Ac only in the evenings but ceiling fan helped. Clean room, lots of outl"
"Festejamos el cumple de una amiga y decidimos pasar dos noches en Sunset. Es un lugar agradable, la habitación era muy limpia y las camas muy buenas para el descanso, después de una noche de celebración.  La hamaca en el balcón hizo mi dia La azotea es excelente para relajarse, ver una hermosa puesta de sol o disfrutar de la piscina. El lugar está cercano a varios bares y restaurantes. Y la playa está a sólo 50 metros, se puede entrar por el Club de Playa Dos Ceibas. Recomendado!!!"
"Justo lo que esperas de una estancia en Tulum, dormir en medio de la jungla, siempre limpio y uno de los pocos lugares con aire acondicionado. La cocina tienen todo lo que necesitas, siempre disponibles con la atención. Súper recomendable."
Nos encanto este lugar muy bien decorado limpio nuevo con gusto muy bien ubicado en mediodía la jungla y dos pasos del hermoso mar de Tulum también tienen restaurante en el frente y cuenta con estacionamiento y tiene picina que decir genial lo recomiendo 100%
Estuve de vacaciones con mi esposo y pasamos unos días maravillosos . Super buen trato todos muy amables en especial el gerente del hotel el sr. Andres el hotel super bonito cómodo instalaciones limpias esperamos volver pronto y pasar otros días increíbles.
"We did a girls birthday trip to Tulum and stayed at Tuluna. There was plenty of space and it was clean. But most important was the free drinks by the pool! We had a great time cause the staff was so nice and welcoming. We left with warm hugs. Thank you Jose, Bryan, Ilse, Isma, Oscar, Claudio, Mr. Security Guard, all the waiters, and everyone else."
"Amazing place, very peaceful, SAMs attention and tips were amazing, Good place to do yoga and drink a juice in the rooftop.  ill be back in december.   pregunten en el desk por los tours, ellos tienes contactos y conocen a toda la gente del pueblo."
"A wonderful place to stay - safe, clean, serviced every day, beautiful rooftop pool, great sunset views, clean kitchen and lovely showers, very friendly and helpful staff. Sofia and Rosalia were so kind and lovely. I injured my hand after a scooter accident and they were brilliant ensuring I had all the care I needed."
"The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and awesome! The environment was very sociable. The bathrooms & showers were great- The breakfast was delicious and right on the rooftop. Location was great! Not a very far walk from the bay or local shopping. They also rent bikes.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this hostel & I would stay again."
"Beautiful stay visiting our friend. Such a magical place to be. Thank you to all of the staff including Sofia & Rosalia, they we’re brilliant, so helpful. Would absolutely come back! The roof top was absolutely wonderful for the sunset and the apartment was fabulous."
"Casa Tzalam is an amazing, very special place. The hosts are incredible people. The hotel is beautiful, lots of comfort, amazingly good value for the price. You get a perfect accomodation, delicious breakfast, great pool, beautiful garden. The tab water is so clean and not salty (as it is in many other hotels in Tulum). Since Casa Tzalam is in the jungle you have fresh jungle water, warm shower, no mosquitoes, perfect a/c in the room. I recommend to have a rental car to get to the lodge. However, you will n"
"The place is okay, but there are a few drawbacks. Its like there's more staff than guests, and they seemed more interested in having a good time themselves than in their guests. The bikes they rent aren't in good condition. The breakfast was 30-40 minutes late - even though we asked 2 times if it was gonna be on time (we had plans for the day that we needed to get to). The morning coffee was pretty weak, but if you buy a barista one it's really good."
Stayed here recently and had a lovely time. Perfect for long stays in Tulum with access to the sister hotel facilities you’ve got the best of both - having your own personal apartment with access to hotel facilities next door. Lovely staff and security.
 is a 5 star accommodation! A life changing experience.  I hope to have the chance to return to Casa Tzalam someday!
"Lovely laid back hostel with comfy beds, clean rooms and pretty out door spaces/rooftop bar. Water refills available for 5 pesos. Breakfast is different every day but not buffet style and small portions"
"Una estancia muy agradable, el departamento es muy lindo, parece muy nuevo, las camas bastante cómodas, la cocina tiene todo lo necesario. El roof del edificio tiene un área de descanso con hamacas que recomiendo ampliamente para ver los atardeceres. La ubicación, a pesar que no está en la zona de playa considero es buena, pues en bici o en auto son alrededor de 10 min de las playas, bares y restaurantes."
"Good all round Hostel. The rooms were clean, bright and spacious, especially the 6 bed dorm upstairs.   The wifi was good, the breakfast was really tasty and a decent size + coffee. And so nice having it on the rooftop.  My only complaint is that the lanyard/key chains they give you with the room key and bike lock key we’re absolute filthy dirty. They are a fabric and baby blue, hanging up in reception and it looks really unprofessional having them so dirty, it’s also really unhygienic.   This is a nice chi"
"We had an amazing time in the hostel. The beds were comfortable, the facilities clean and there's a very relaxed atmosphere in the hostel. The day after we left they opened a rooftop café and I know i'll have to come back one day to try it out. If I'm in Tulum, I'll stay here."
"Paid twice the price than Cancun and Merida, unfortunately, this is the only one did not provide complimentary towels, which is the least worry here. I was placed in an all-female room and received hostile female gazing as they claim this should be a female dorm rather than a coed one, which is the administration's fault obvs. During my stay, the showing curtain rod is on the floor, report to the desk right away yet no one cared to fix even after my departure."
"First time in Mexico, read a lot of negative stuff before coming regarding safety in this area. Our experience was the furthest from that.   Amazing place, hotel was very nice, clean, all staff and service has been 10/10. Food was very nice, breakfast included was always top quality and meals in the restaurant were also to this high standard.  For anyone worried about safety in Tulum; we dont drink alcohol so easy for us to avoid bars/clubs & nightlife. We were never out when the sun had gone down as the ro"

"We found this lovely place  on our way back to the airport CUN to catch our flight back to Europe! So friendly, helpful staff and nice atmosphere. Unfortunately we only had time for breakfast, but time we plan to stay there. Conny and Rodolfo"
"The hotel has the perfect location to visit Cobá Ruins, the colonial city of Valladolid, Tulum, and beautiful cenotes. A new hotel, simple, comfortable, very clean, local staff very friendly. A walk distance from local craft shops and little restaurants in Francisco Uh May, a real Mayan town. Highly recommended!"
"What a beautiful hotel! Everyone was so nice, rooms were so clean and nice decor. The pool was so refreshing and breakfast was delicious and they also have a menu for additional items if you want. The A/C in my room was amazing so cool after coming back from a hot day. Hasta la proxima Tulum"
"Great hotel, modern and spotlessly clean. We stayed 6 nights on honeymoon and it was a great base for Chitzen Itsa, jungle tour, siam Ka'an and the beach. Location is 2min walk from the strip and right beside a subway and shop which was handy for snacks for trips. A+"
"It’s on a great location,walking distance to the center. Many shops and restaurants close by. Close to the cenotes and the beach. New hotel,very clean and very cozy. The only thing I didn’t like was the breakfast,that’s why it is 4/5."
"Modern hotel, friendly staff with off road parking.   Small pool and seating area.  WiFi is per room so you lose this if go upstairs for breakfast, which is very basic.   Only a couple of blocks walk from bars and restaurants.   Good location for Tulum ruins. "
"We loved our stay at muyu, it was very close to the town centre and main Street. Was also very close to the road where cenotes are located. Included breakfast was good and the owner went above and beyond to make sure everything was fine with our room. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. "
Stay away at all costs! I had to cancel reservation due to COVID restrictions change and they refused to provide me with a voucher to use when I could actually visit. Also they charged me more and had to get my money back from booking.com. Terrible experience. I also read later that there is very loud music from the clubs nearby and you can't sleep. Ended up loosing my money and booking another more expensive hotel to have a positive experience.
"It was a fraud, they charged me 5% extra for my credit card, no AC and they tell me afterwards. Customer service 0 and I spent an hour explaining the situation and in an hour to other customers were complaining. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL, please. No one should stay here. I went to another hotel and I didn’t get my money back :("
We stopped by the restaurant on our way back from Taak Bi Ha based on a recommendation from our tour guide. The ceviche and shrimp tacos were amazing. They were served with a delicious garlic sauce and a spicy habanero salsa.
"This place is decorated with Balinese furniture, Good A/C, the Japanese restaurant inside is nice . By the way , also the Argentinian receptionist was so friendly and made you feel like home, which is nice "
"We are a family of 4 with 2 small kids and we spend around a week on this hotel and we are very happy with it.  It is located right next to the best cenotes on the area and it is quite easy to find.  Room are quite clean and spacious, beds are comfortable. Tv has cable and there is quite good space to store all your clothes. Breakfast is yummy but simple,  You can choose between 5 options and all include a juice or a coffee. Service is quite good, Daniel gave us a lot of tips for us to walk around the area."
 at that time . We will come back !
"We stayed a Casa Colonial the last week of February.  It’s a gem on the main avenue in Tulum. It’s very clean, quiet & has a peaceful atmosphere. In our room there was a packet of earplugs which had me concerned. I used them each night  & slept well. My husband didn’t and he said he heard music from a club during the night but it wasn’t enough that he needed the earplugs. The hotel staff and security were very friendly & helpful. Hoping to get a room here on my next trip in a couple of months."
"The shower was cold, with no pressure. The Wifi wasn’t working at all during our stay. One night, the AC broke in all rooms of the hotel cause of an electronic device. Our room neighbor had the exact experience with the shower and the wifi. Do not go to casa colonial. It would be a mistake."
"Is the best option forever, i like it so much the pool and the rooms. Perfect i go with my husband and we love this hotel. Thank's for the best aniversary. So the food of the restaurant is delicius and healthy. The coffee in the morning and mojitos in the nigth, is close the center and the bus station."
"After staying at the beach we decided to stay few days in Tulum center . This is a  nice  friendly hotel , good  beds , outdoor pool, nice vintage decor, very clean , good breakfast ( included) in a nice open air patio . Very conveniently located on the main avenue , few steps from the bus terminal and lots of choices of restaurants nearby . Front desk helpful on what to do and how to get around town and assisted kindly  with our personal needs , a great choice in Tulum."
"Casa Colonial is in the city center. Great location to stay with Tulum shopping and restaurants with in 10min walk. The hotel doesn’t have breakfast buffets but the menu is good and tasty, next to the hotel is two great choices for breakfast. There is a bike rental 20m from the hotel. The beach is 20-30min bike ride away. Hotel staff is friendly, hotel is clean. Recommend to stay or go for dinner/ breakfast when in Tulum. "
"The rooms are furnished with the very bare minimum (one bed, one small table, one small closet and nothing else), the only window available has a view on the inside garden so you have to keep it closed and it feels like you are in a room in the basement.  But that will quickly be the least of your concerns as the place is located just above a nightclub which blasts techno music until 5AM, so almost impossible to get any sleep.  We stayed one night and then left immediately and had to argue for hours with st"
A newly renovated hotel with space for improvement. First of all we were asked a deposit of $600 which had not been mentioned in Booking.com and it was a bit of a hassle to recover as it was not deducted from the full payment requested upon our arrival. First shower I took when we arrived I almost burnt myself since there was no more cold water in the hotel’s cistern as we later found out. The WiFi was poor and did not work in all areas as advertised. The worst factor in this hotel though is that it is supe
"My wallet disappeared,we were looking for it until we found that one of the RECEPTIONIST HAD THE WALLET IN HIS ROOM ??  His excuse was he was keeping it for us, but...he did not accept he had it until we asked him several times. The story does not finish here, the bank called has that we had been charged 5 times more for the night. $500 for a stinky noisy room? NOT recommend this place AT ALL!"
Right so we were lucky enough to find emotion hostel as it’s location is fabulous but is tucked in between a souvenir shop and an Italian restaurant. We were met by Marco one of the managers who was friendly and helpful throughout my entire stay. Staff were always happy to go above and beyond and their ability to speak several languages proved helpful to us and other travellers. The deco is unique. The rooms are absolutely fine and there is tv and ac. The bathroom is tired looking but again worth what you’r
" there is any room for improvement it would be breakfast. I recommend that breakfast is not included and that is charged separately whilst the breakfast menu to include fresh juices, fresh bread, fresh butter etc.   Also the members of staff know a lot of the sellers, tour guides etc so they will always point you to the right direction or facilitate tours for you.  Cheapest bike hire in Tulum too!   I will be back for sure! Thanks again!!! 💃🏻   Lots of love,  Mimi x"

"The hostel had some interesting characters but for the most part my stay here was very pleasant and offered showers, washrooms etc. The beds were comfortable and room was very clean upon arrival. The wifi struggled at somepoints however the communal spaces had good wifi. The staff were simply amazing and helped me to schedule a tour to Chichen Itza which was great. The breakfast was very minimal but filled the void."
"Unfortunately, we didnt have a nice staying while in the hostel. My friend and I arrived very late at night and after checking in we asked to use one of the lockers near the reception. The following day when we were about to leave my friend checked her wallet that was in the locker and all her money was gone. There were two holes there which one of them was connected to the toilet of one of the guest room. The owner, Antonio asked for one of the employees to fix the locker right away, after showing us video"
" there for free for a few days, but of course, we didnt want to due to what had happened plus the place itself was dirty, filthy and with a very bad vibe. We left and when my friend started to talk to Antonio through whatzapp he was a completely different person questioning if we really had that money there and told us he could do nothing about it and even made a sarcastic joke saying we could go the public ministry. It is a shame such behavior  as the hostel has totally responsibility for such thievery."
…
"A bit overpriced for what it was, but at the time I was in Tulum, the only thing left. A lot of noise from the bars at night and a little run down, but the staff were very helpful and friendly and also cheapest place to rent a bike I could find. Breakfast was pretty underwhelming too."
"We spent 3 nights here and it was excellent. The rooms are basic, so too the breakfast, but you aren’t paying top dollar so it’s alright. We received an email from the hotel a few weeks before our staying informing us about a party they were hosting on our final night. We asked for a quieter room in advance and they have us the room furtherest away from the party without guaranteeing peace and quiet. It turned out to be ok. We still heard the party but it wasn’t too bad. The staff are super chilled and frie"
"The location is perfect (in between the beach and town).  We were not there just for the beach, we were in Tulum for the Mayan Ruins and especially the Cenote's and good food so our location was absolutely perfect. The beach is extremely expensive and the road to get there and back is always VERY congested.  By staying at our location we got 3 times the room for a third of the price.  We did have dinner at the sister hotel one of our nights and having the beach access is important because there is literally"
 the room (you will not be disappointed).  We will absolutely stay here again.

The hotel is very clean and the staff are very pleasant. I had the family room which is great and has a lot of space. Would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in tulum who wants to detach. Can get taxi into town for around 150 peso and to the beach for 300 peso
"My first trip to Mexico was to Tulum, the not so sleepy hideaway 90mins south of Cancun. We stayed in town at Alma de Flores. This hotel was great, perfect location and not too expensive. The area has a lot of construction but it didn’t distract from the relaxing vibes.   The hotel had a great pool and wonderful service. Always helped us get a taxi and arrange travel. Only downside is no restaurants or stores within walking distance (have to drive 10mins or bike 8mins... would be like 45+ min walk)  They ha"
"Stayed at this wonderful hotel for vacation for 11 nights. Great staff and awesome rooms, garden and pool. You have free beach club access at the sister hotel Alma Tulum, drinks are served to the beach, prices great. We were greatly aided by Luis and Alain in reception and Moo and Carlos at the restaurant (both in the mornings and at the beach club).  Visitors should note that the hotel is located outside the town and the beach area in a new real estate development. For getting around, budgeting taxi or ren"
"My husband and I spent two nights in the Chit Panoramica.  Beautiful room, excellent breakfast, perfect cleaning and a very kind staff.  The hotel is surrounded by green and plants; it is not in the center but in the Aldea Zama area, therefore far from the confusion of the Pueblo.  All very relaxing!"
"Came to Tulum  for the 2nd year in a row for my daughter's 26th birthday.We stayed at Alma de Flores for 1 week and we loved it!   The people at the desk were friendly and helpful! Breakfast was free in the morning and was  very good! You could rent bikes for 200pesos (24 hours) and they were very nice. Rode to the beach and downtown. The first night we checked in we decided to ask the cost of upgrading to a suite. Cost was $60more FOR THE WEEK!! We had much more room and our own private pool, it was deligh"

"The place is a little gem hidden in the busy Tulum  streets.  It’s quiet, the room is very big, it has everything you need inside! Each room Ba sits private balcony.  Our kids slept in the mezzanine and loved to have their own little area.  The beds are super comfortable (and I’m a difficult one!). The pool is a big bonus as Tulum is very hot and only beaches.  Better to rent a car and move around with the car.  Private parking available for free.  There is absolutely everything next door: amazing breakfast"

" You can even rent the whole place and privatise it if you are a big group, price is super affordable for the quality!  Next time in Tulum I will return at Alicat villas!  Thank you Ali!!"
"We stayed here for 9 nights the end of January through the beginning of February. The place was really nice and we enjoyed it. However, the online amenities listed and room types were all mixed up so what we thought we booked and what it said in all of our conformation emails was different from what the hotel had on file. We had to pay an additional 500.00 US dollars to get the room we already booked. We then had to argue for hours with the website for that to be refunded. You cannot reach the hotel by phon"
Place was super cool and nice! Staff was very nice and helpful when possible. Only One staff could speak English. The room and place were really nice and clean. A bit more expensive than it probably should be but it included breakfast and in a great location!

"El lugar es super agradable, tienen buena ubicación, el trato es muy amable, la pasamos de lujo, nos divertimos muchísimo, la piscina el ambiente de cabañas, además todo super limpio impecable, me encantó super recomendado. Si vas a visitar tulum y son varios amigos o parejas esta increíble, incluso si lo rentas en familia. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"We stayed at this place with 2 kids because the location is very close to the city centre and it has kitchen. Although the general of house is clean, kitchen was dusty. I needed to wash everything before use. The pool is a bit small but our kids loved it. Silent place, staff was very helpful. Thanks for the juice and chips!"
"Beware of their 3% credit card surcharge! This hotel is the ONLY negative experience I had during my entire 2-week trip throughout Mexico: the hot water was cold half of the time; no hair dryer in the room; the room reeked the odor of chemicals; it was extremely loud at night--they kept a dog who would howl an entire night right outside your window; the breakfast was way below Mexican standard, with only bread, fruits, and coffee, nothing was freshly made, no eggs, no nothing. The owner won't even lift her "
"Las instalaciones son perfectas, un lugar limpio, confortable y caminando a su alrededor puedes encontrar muchos restaurantes, sin duda volvería a repetir la experiencia Alicat. Las habitaciones cómodas, fui con un grupo de amigas y sin duda es el lugar perfecto para hospedarse, la pasamos de maravilla."
"We were looking for a simple place to explore Tulum and, in Villas Akalan, we definitely found it. The hosts were incredibly helpful, directing us to the best beaches and nearby cenotes and being nothing but friendly and accommodating. The rooms are simple but clean and comfortable. Try to go for an upstairs room so you have the evening sunset. Only thing is that it is necessary to have a car since the beach and main access to the restaurants in Tulum are a few miles away but there are some nice restaurants"
very clean and neat. rode a bicycle (rented at the hotel)  to the beach. staff was always on point. rooms were very modern and clean. the penthouse pool was amazing for relaxing having a glass of wine.  I will definitely  be back.
" nice and pleasant, but it did not offset the overall unpleasant experience."
"Fui con mis amigos, visitábamos el sur de México, en un viaje desde España. Conocimos Cancún, Playa del Carmen, algunos pueblos más y por último Tulum. Queríamos un ambiente privado y tranquilo. Encontramos Alicat Villas, como un sitio increíble. Muy cerca de las ruinas de Tulum que queríamos visitar. Cerca del centro también y de todos los sitios de marcha jeje. Y lo mejor el precio, para como está todo en Tulum, es de lo mejor que se pueden encontrar precio-calidad.  Es un sitio en el que estuvimos mejor "
"This place is so beautiful, I just stared at it for a while when I first got there. Beautiful luscious trees and flowers all around which make you feel like you are in a little piece of paradise. The villa was big, comfortable and it immediately felt like home. The pool was great and I loved spending time there. The location is literally perfect. You are right in the center but on a quiet street so it is a great little retreat from all the action. You can rent bikes to ride around the center and go to the b"

"SO RECOMMENDED :) We had an amazing time in the beautiful Villas Akalan. So beautiful spot. Cool and helpful service. Right in the center with bikes available. The pool is amazing and we had it for ourself the whole time. Totally recommended. Beds are comfy, water is hot. I was able to sleep like a baby my whole stay. Enjoy amigos!"
"Stayed for two nights here and it was a great choice. Alejandra, the owner, was super friendly and recommended lots of great places. She was helpful and made my stay very welcoming. The place is very central and easy access to the main road. The small coffee place serves yummy food and has great juices!!! Recommend it highly."
"We had the best time ever in this hotel. After dousens of hotels we draw the conclusion that this hotel has the most personal service. They went above and beyond for our wellbeing.  After many days with the kids in small hotel rooms we wanted an appartment. And this appartement was brand new, high ceiling, lots of space. New big smart Tv's and good internet. It had it all.  They rememberd our kids names, they took care of us when we became sick and much more. This is the first hotel where the employees have"
"The hotel is really lovely but very loud. 800 pesos is very expensive for the conditions. Our room was next to the street, so sleeping was no option. The bar around play music till 5 o’clock.We took two bike for 50peso each and both were really bad as well. Sorry but only 2*"
"Great location and great staff! The location es very good because it is a walking distance from shops, retaurants, grocery shopping, etc... and a short bike ride away from the beach. Rooms were clean and well furnished."
"Hotel Nicte-Ha is a wonderful place to stay; clean, fresh and close to everything you’d need or want for your visit! Alejandra is a wonderful host and you can tell she really cares about her guests 💖 There is a wonderful cafe attached to the hotel as well, Cafe Turu, which is perfect for a healthy breakfast or lunch 😍 Juan Carlos and Vicki are fantastic cooks and make real treats! Highly recommend!"
"This new hotel in Aldea Zama is difficult to find but worth it. The whole area is very well laid out and away from the madding crowd. It is a quiet and safe part of Tulum. Hotel was very good with roof top pool, verandah area with a private pool and a nice breakfast area. Vegetation makes you feel you are in a tropical garden. The staff were excellent - nothing too much trouble especially Esli and Sergio."
"Room wasn’t ready on time Safe - broken. Didn’t fix it Cleaners - lazy. Didn’t clean room properly  24hr WhatsApp - ignored Restaurant staff - poorly trained, and bad service  Room - damp  WiFi - didn’t work On site complaint - ignored Email complaint - ignored  The room prices were very high, and the service fell way short. Staff just didn’t respond to feedback seemingly not really caring.   Email follow up complaint completely ignored.   If I could give zero stars I would.   Would not recommend at all"
"We needed a hotel at the height of the season, between Christmas and New Year, and ended up here because it was among the cheaper options. However, over US$100 a night for this place seems rather steep. The rooms are simple, which some might call cozy, it's very noisy in terms of traffic and music, and in our case there was no hot water. The breakfast was quite acceptable, if a bit overpriced too. I can't quite see the point of this place."
"A small and peaceful place near the center of Tulum. Excellent location close to the road to the beaches. A beatiful little garden with a refreshing pool, nice and helpful staff. Perfect for a family of five with grown up youths."
"I stayed at this chic, boutique hotel in Tulum for 2 nights in May 2022 and it was fabulous! My room was on the first floor at the rear. Huge room and bathroom with high ceiling. It overlooked the mangrove forest which was stunning!, with a large balcony where I sat down at times to enjoy the cool breeze.  The bathroom overlooked the forest as well!, that was exceptionally beautiful and calming for me each time I had a shower.  Loved the antique furniture, gave it a rustic vibe. The bed is large and comfort"
I’ve stayed 7-8 places in Tulum and Nicte Ha is by far my favorite. You can’t beat the price and location. The rooms are exceptionally clean and extremely well decorated. The back patio is a great hang out spot and they also have a great coffee shop/smoothie bar right on premise. They rent bikes and scooters too but the best thing about the hotel is the owner Alejandra. Ask for he when you get there she is the best you will love her guaranteed!!
"Excelente opción para vacaciones en Tulum, el lugar cuenta con estacionamiento, servicio de renta de bicicletas, servicio de desayunos, el personal muy amable, limpieza impecable. El departamento tiene todo lo necesario para una estancia confortable y sentirte como en casa. Seguro regresamos!"
I loved the idea of this place and it came highly recommended by the Lonely Planet. Unfortunately a nearby club plays music very loudly until at least 5am (we stayed Monday and Tuesday). I can generally sleep through anything but not this time - I even wore ear plugs that had been supplied. This is the first time I have ever worn ear plugs. I still had a very uncomfortable night. We hoped it had been a one off but it happened the second night. We had booked three nights but left. If you want good sleep do n
" strip with many restaurants, bars and retail shops, which was convenient for me.  The staff is polite and always available. Diego, who has been working tirelessly at the front desk, always greeted me with a large smile and is very knowledgeable about the places to visit in the vicinity. He’s a star!  The manager of the hotel who also manages 2 other properties near was very helpful and even drove me and a few others, about once!  Overall I had a wonderful experience and stay at Tulum at this beautiful hote"
"The Budget Twin Room located by the entrance had a strong cigarette smell when checking in at 7pm , couldn't stand it so did not stay any longer.  Communication was very hard with the staff member. Seems like some basic customer service training is needed here.   There wasn't any other room options either. We did try switching on fan on full speed and open the window and door. But no change, asked for some kind of spray, staff never came. I ended up trying with my anti bacterial spray, nothing changed. I co"
"Nos encanto! un lugar rodeado de naturaleza, te hace sentir realmente en la selva. El depa muy amplio y bonito El staff muy atento, nos hicieron buenas recomendaciones de lugares para visitar comer etc. Teníamos nuestra alberca privada. La zona es muy tranquila y segura, está cerca del centro y las playas de Tulum."
"We stayed 2 nights in late November 2017 which is still low season so the room rate was good value for money in a popular destination along the Riviera Maya. Located on the main avenue close to everything. The room was adequate. Biggest complaints were low water pressure in the shower (not uncommon in the region) and the bed was a bit too small for 2 people. It overlooked a nice little tropical garden at the back and Tulum's main drag in the front from a shared balcony. Not the hotel's fault, but we spent o"

Nothing mentioned about this on the website when I booked the tickets. The line was crazy busy, thousands of people crammed together with no masks waiting to get a Covid test. This was actually the first time in Mexico I was seriously worried I would getting Covid. Once it was midnight, I was still stuck in the line. When I finally got to"

"I stayed in casa ambar because it was in a prime location in the hotel zone. They also had free bikes which I didn't know about to help me get around. It was nicer than waiting in a taxi. They had 2 sister hotels - I could access the beach from one, and a private cenote at the other. Why pay thousands for one of the popular hotels when you get the benefits of 3 hotels with your stay here? Definitely will come back again. The private cenote made everything worth it. Took some drone photos while I was there. "
" so weird because there was a very clear sign inside the room by the door, stating no smoking.    I said that it is impossible to be in that room, I was saying that I will check out/leave. The staff member explained that he was making calls but manager didn't pick up phone.   We had worked all day and arrived late and really just needed to rest. He was just standing there like he did not know what to do, when we explained in Spanish he just agreed that it smelled and that was it.   My last resource was book"
"This was luxurious place for the value. Everything was new and looks great. True, there is a lot of construction in the area, but we did not have any problems walking to the restaurants or getting taxi. It is little secluded, but not remote at all. Staff is attentive, and very helpful, provided us with everything we asked for (fixed internet, brought coffee maker, made sure water was ok).   The only complaint I could have is that isolation is not the best and you can very clearly hear guests in adjacent roo"
"We had a lovely private double room with our own bathroom & shared balcony. It was fairly quiet so not really a backpackers location, but in a good location & included a healthy breakfast but prices are fairly high."
"Ecological wooden cabins in front of a cenote. From the terrace of your cabin the water is under your feet, we were also kayaking in the cenote and swimming.  It have a very quiet pool since the place is for guests only. You can find some good electronic music events here in high tourist season.  We will definitely be back for the music."
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! I have video proof of mice running around the kitchen were they cook your breakfast! The “manager” of this property tried to call me a liar and said I took the video at a different property, it’s blatantly obvious it’s their kitchen because the photos of the kitchen correspond with my video 😊 Absolutely disgusting hotel and the staff are the worst I have ever dealt with especially the manager who is extremely ignorant and rude! €1700 for 5 nights and we only stayed for 1 night as we w"

"He estado solo un fin de semana y me he quedado con ganas de más. Es un hotel muy nuevo en medio de la selva, pero con las comodidades de estar en Aldea Zama. El staff super atento y con mucho conocimiento del lugar porque me recomendaron un tour de cenotes, que nos encantó y dos restaurantes muy buenos. Sin duda volveremos"
"This hotel is in a great location, right on the main strip and close to a lot of the action. However, despite being recommended by Lonely Planet, it leaves a lot to be desired. The beds are hard and pillows flat. It was hard to get additional blankets or pillows from the housekeeping, and they kept taking it back when they cleaned. Speaking of clean, it wasn't. The floor felt like we were always at the beach, and they never cleaned the bathroom floor. They sometimes left enough towels for us, sometimes not."
" one plug in the whole room actually worked!  The room was covered in dust, I have asthma and really struggled to breath hence why we only stayed the one night.  The noise was unbearable! We could hear conversations being had in the reception from our room, you could hear people walking up and down the stairs at 6 in the morning! If you value your money AT ALL I highly advise to avoid staying at this hotel!"
"First of all this is a beautiful place,unique and well managed by Daniel.I have been in several places in Tulum but Zereno is my No.1 From day 1 Daniel helped us to feel like home in  this modern 2 floor apartment (305) the best view by the way from the 3rd floor.A/C working perfect,wiifii very fast in the all area,decor of apartment is very stylish as well.If you ask you can have room cleaning every day.Basicly any request we have had Daniel sort the problem out imidietelly.Zereno is located in Aldea Zama,"
"I walked around looking for a room since the hostel I arrived was awful and I wanted another place to stay. Peak season so everthing packed, and expensive. Nicte-ha had availability for 3 nights at 800 peso per night. The guy did not speak English but Google translate helped. Room not to big but OK and clean. Paid for the first night only because had to get to the ATM. When I arrived after having cancelled my other hostel booking I heard that the next day I had to move to another room. Checked that room but"

" only to be told that the room was not available anymore. What kind of service is that! So I was kinda forced to check out after 1 night, while I made a booking for 3. Actually after that 1 night I was glad to check out because it had been very noisy during the night with traffic, dogs, other guests arriving and loud TV at the reception. Really cardboard walls. Did not feel safe since the room could not be locked from inside and all the noise at night was just outside my door. Shower only had cold water. Bi"
"What a beautiful hotel.  The staff was very helpful and friendly. Being in the jungle was such a lovely experience. The bed was great. We had fresh water in our room every day.  We made excellent use of the free bikes and the other properties. The breakfast each morning was awesome. It is in the nightlife area, so there is noise at night. The wifi is spotty. As long as you don't have work to do, it is fine. I highly recommend Casa Ambar"

"We stayed in this location for three nights and loved the place! The hotel is perfectly situated. It sits rights across the street from a number of beach clubs, bars, and restaurants. There is great night life all around this part of Tulum, but we did not think the place was too loud (as some have said), since the hotel backs up into the jungle and has a big inner courtyard between the building and the street. Our room was  spacious and had an amazing balcony and massive open shower. The staff is what made "

So relaxing with the huge bed and beautiful balcony and view. Omg there is a restaurant right downstairs of the hotel and the food was amazing. Everything fresh to order. Service is as perfect, and if you go you must try the cheesecake. Overall 5 star. We met the Owners family and they made us feel right a"
"Sometimes things don't go perfect.  How management/owners handle situations like this go a long way for me.  Fernando (the manager) and Magdeep (the owner) handled such an opportunity like pros.  I was there to chill and relax...not so much to party (like a good amount of people visiting the area).  I usually stay on the beach, but wanted to see what a week in town would be like comparatively.  The rooms are clean, comfortable, very roomy and adequate in every way possible...especially considering the rate "
" booming house music until 12:30.  I found this to be inconsiderate to say the least.  After informing Fernando and later Magdeep of my bad night, they moved to a room further away from the courtyard and bar and guaranteed that everything would be quiet after 11:00 for the rest of my stay.  They delivered.  I would not hesitate to stay here again and appreciate that they understood that I desired an experience that might have been slightly different from their average clientele."

"Wir sind durch Zufall an diesem Hotel vorbei gekommen. Ich denke es hat uns gefunden;) Es ist sooooo schön dort. Überall erkennt man die Liebe zum Detail. Die Menschen dort sind einfach nur großartig. Man fühlte sich wie Zuhause und wollte nicht mehr weg. Hotel Boheme ist ein Muss in Tulum. Ich komme bestimmt wieder! Danke an Fernando,  Bruce und allen, die unseren Aufenthalt dort unvergesslich machten:)  Liska, Melissa & Mareen"
"The hotel is right on the beach, just a few rooms, very very calm. You can see palms, pelicans, sand and the sea just 5 steps from your room. I had even a house with a bedroom, a living room and small kitchen which was fully equipped. There was refrigerator and all necessary diches. There were sunbeds, hammocks and two small tables with chairs outside my house. The house was clearn, good towels, a hairdryer, beach towels were also provided. There was airconditioner in both rooms as well as fan. Housekeeping"
" Entrance fee is 150 pesos. There are a few other hotels arround where you can get lunch and dinner.  The hotel is quite far from everything if you have no car. It is about 10 km from Tulum downtown, and the same distance from zona hotelleria. Taxis can be found just few steps from the hotel but they are expensive (400-600 pesos for 10 min ride, more expensive after dark). There is a possibility to use a Collectivo microbus that runs from Tulum to Playa del Carmen but you need to catch it standing on the hi"
"Pros: Valeria and Alex were exceptionally helpful, especially Alex who would message me back on his day off! He helped me with making reservations and gave me good restaurant recommendations. I briefly met Coco who also very friendly. The cabin was basic but clean and a cool concept. I had the ground floor cabin. Great location and I used the beach access from another hotel that Valeria recommended, think it was called La Luna. I had the most delicious spicy mescalita from the restaurant!!!! Also the cabin "

"It’s a great location close to the beach but what I found so special about it, is the rooms itself. We stayed in the deluxe studio and had fantastic view into the jungle. At night you get a beautiful view into the stars above Tulum.  Another big plus is the super friendly and supportive staff. We got great restaurant recommendations and tour tips. Overall we felt in good hands!  Highly recommend to stay here."
"I stayed a couple of days at Casa Colibrí with my husband for our honeymoon, and honestly it was the best decision. Melisa is the best host, she’s always caring for her guests to make them feel like home. The rooms are just seconds away from the beach (the best oceanview!), and if you’re lucky like us you can even get to see a turtle nest <3.  I almost forgot, the breakfast is fresh, homemade and tasty. This place is totally worth it, so if you’re staying in Tulum this is your best choice."

We were very impressed with the room, its jungle theme and the front desk was great. Carlos was AMAZING. He hooked us up with the best places to go and could answer all our questions. You do have privacy and they direct you to the room right when you arrive. They are very accommodating and provide filtered water, shampoo/conditioner and towels. You also can a"

We didn't mind this, however Carlos let us know if we needed he had a Bungalow towards the back of the property that we could use for the night. They also have an rooftop for food and drinks.

It was remarkably quiet, also which was a concern due to the loud music across the street. Waking up and grabbing a cappuccino and smoothie was the perfect way to start my day. Their menu offers healthy and delicious organic food.  The price was fantastic but that is not what makes this place a gem.

Pablo, you will be a huge asset to any establishment that is fortunate enough to hire you.  Thank you for all your help.  Carlos, thank you for the hospitality, interesting conversation, and insight. If I still worked in the business I would hire all of you.  You are quite a team."
"Hermoso spot con  atención del mesero raziel, quien nos dio un servicio increíble. Buena música, buena cómoda y buenos cocteles. Ambiente ideal para disfrutar con amigos y familia. Gracias por la atención de todos."
"Desde el comienzo la anfitriona Dalia fue de lo más amable y considerada. Nos ayudó a adaptarnos a Tulum y nos aconsejó sobre todas las actividades, precios, restaurantes y museos. El mejor Wi Fi de la zona, habitaciones limpias y una comunidad amigable."
"Be cautious when booking a place here. My ""month contract"" was ended two weeks early. I was not given a refund for the two weeks that I had paid for at Elixir. Dalia will show you the place, and she is nice. However, the company is not good and is tricky (as the other review here noted). There are many great places to stay in Tulum. I would not recommend Elixir."

"We spent a week at the Little Gem after our original booking had to be cancelled.  The location was ideal for us as a couple traveling in our own vehicle.  The hotel is small, quiet, intimate, and lovely.  The room was large, comfortable, and has a small semi-private seating area outside by the pool.  The staff was great:  courteous, helpful, and friendly.  We will definitely stay here again in the future."
"We spent about a week at the Little Gem Charme Hotel since our originally planned beach hotel was not viable for us due to heat and the smell from the Sargasso algae. While the neighborhood may look sketchy to some with potholes and lots of construction going on, the room we had was modern, clean, quiet and nice with a fridge and very cold AC .  Neighborhood restaurants abound, a coffee/breakfast place is across the street. Staff was AWESOME in helping us getting reasonably priced cabs to Chichen Itza, the "

"This little hotel is a little Gem as for the look of it.  But lets talk about the theft.. this hotel allowed housekeeping to rob several of the rooms for watches and cash and did nothing.  They locked the doors from the outside and had an armed guard standing at the door which did not allow the guest to come and go as they pleased. This place may look amazing, but just know it is far from safe and their goal is to steal your valuables."
I stayed with a group of friends at LITTLE GEM AND LET'S START WITH SAYING 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE WATCHES and 2 people money WERE STOLEN. The staff would not get the owner to come talk to us or show the video
I was torn on how to write this review.  I am giving it 5 stars because I think it delivered on its promise of what I was expecting - a very inexpensive place with a clean room and good service.  My wife and I stayed here just one night as we arrived at night from Cancun and didn't feel it worthwhile to pay for the expensive hotels along the beach in Tulum given our late arrival.    Here are the pros: 1.  Very inexpensive  2. New and hence modern and clean rooms 3. Very friendly and helpful staff - Graciana

"Excelente lugar en Tulum, gran trato y experiencia, tienen un excelente servicio a la llegada y la partida.  Cuentan con servicios adicionales, alberca y espacios comunitarios en excelentes condiciones.  Sin duda un lugar que deben visitar."
This Airbnb was absolutely perfect! The hosts were tentative only when needed. It was super private and away from all the craziness that is the hotel district. The roads are unpaved but a small cost for such a wonderful experience and affordable place. We had a couples massage on our patio that was incredible as well. Highly recommend!

"We came to Tulum to have it as a base for exploring Yucatán while having a spectacular beach at our doorstep. Specifically, we wanted to visit the nearby Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. La Casa Mia was the perfect base for us. The ground floor apartment we had was huge. We had a big well-equipped kitchen to cook in for the days we didn't want to go out and sit on the beachfront and eat at one of the many eateries there. The beach was just across, less than 5 minutes to touch the sea. There was also a small ro"
"So, I'm going to start by saying that all of the positive reviews are warranted (in general.) This isn't a bad place to stay (per se.). In short the value proposition is fair, unless it rains. Now I understand that  no one can control the weather but a property owner can absolutely control leaks in the roof.  Rain coming through leaks in the roof made one of the bedrooms unusable. Leaks in the roof left standing water in the kitchen during the storm.   As it stands, I'd likely would not have mentioned only "

"Pocna beach restaurant is EPIC. We have been 7 days in Tulum and this part of the beach is the best if you are looking for beauty, nature and chilled vibe. Wilson who was serving us is the best waiter I have encountered in Tulum by a mile. We ordered Pulpo which was incredible and their drinks were very well made in both aesthetics and taste. We will literally be back tomorrow. Massively recommended!"
"The interior of the room is tastefully decorated. Location is great, on the main avenue. Room is big, bed is extremely big and comfortable, and the aircond is strong - something you really need in this hot humid weather.  The ladies at the front desk are friendly and always smiley. That makes a big difference from a good hotel, to a great hotel - the staff.  I had a wonderful stay."
"Chambre très spacieuse et particulièrement bien décorée avec frigo et salle de bain propre Literie bonne Hôtel en retrait du centre mais extrêmement bruyant… bruit de la circulation à toute heure, chambre mal insonorisée  Personnel accueillant"

"El servicio es muy bueno, la gente a cargo es muy amable. Las habitaciones son hermosas tienen toques únicos que hacen de tu estancia la mejor experiencia  y tienen todo muy limpio. Debajo del hotel hay un restaurante que tiene comida deliciosa."
I only had a chance to stay one night at this hotel due to hurricane warning in the area.  Alicia was the hostess with the mostess.  She waited to greet me very late at night and gave me a tour of the property right away.  She made me feel very comfortable and even offered to take me to the market the next day if I needed anything.  The bed was comfortable and the room had beautiful pottery.  Plush bathrobes and nice shower.  The amenities and design of the property was nature meets local maya culture.  Ali

"My family and I stayed here March 2022 for spring break.  For starters, Tulum is quite a distance away for the airport. It’s roughly a 90 minute or longer drive.  Upon arrival, no one a at the front office. We contacted Karen via WhatsApp and she quickly responded.   The Room:  The room was average, a let out sofa that’s the size of a full bed and one bed upstairs. It has 1.5 baths, and a kitchenette area.  I think I was expecting more, but it was ok after we settled in.  FYI: the toilets have a tendency to"
" be wrong. Nevertheless, it’s a decent rooftop area.  Also, there are 2 swings up there as well, that was a nice touch.   The Area: The hotel is located in a very busy area, but the plus is that it’s surrounded by a plethora of restaurants, shoppes, pharmacies, and bars.  We walked and ate at a different restaurant every night.  This hotel is not near any beaches, so take that into consideration.   The Staff: Karen was really nice and courteous. She was always very responsive when we needed towels, directio"

"Muy buena ubicación, cerca de food trucks, restaurants y markets. Es un loft muy moderno, Quedé muy conforme de la atención, la limpieza y las comodidades. La piscina en el roof está perfecta. Lo elegiría nuevamente si visito Tulum.Estacionamiento free."
"Hotel comodo en el centro de tulum a muy buen precio comparados con los hoteles en la zona de la playa que son carisimos. Dispone de habitaciones tipo departamento, totalmente amueblados y con todo lo necesario, cocina, refrigerador, micro ondas, tostadora, mesa comedor, aire acondicionado, ventilador, wifi, TV con cable etc. Realmente comodo y comparando calidad-precio es una excelente opcion. Tienen un roof con piscina muy agradable y con vista a toda la ciudad. Muy recomendable y Karen la responsable una"
"dishonest people - money stolen from the room - they say they have never had this kind of problem but the google reviews say otherwise -  the boss just propose us to call the police, It's not a professional way to work - it's a shame because the place has potential"
"Going to keep it short. This place is close to everything in the center of town. Rooms are huge and clean, AC colder than the artic. Anytime I’ve had an issue they have fixed it/addressed ASAP.  The property manager Karen is great. If she hasn’t gotten a raise lately, she needs one!"
"There is a good and a bad. The bad was just that check in and check out was an ordeal. We are American w/o Mexican SIM cards and our phones don’t work w/o wifi. They do not staff the office so when we arrived we found a note with a number to call for check in. We had to go to Starbucks a few blocks away and luckily found a nice person who let us use  their phone to send a text. Then we had to repeat the process at check out (we couldn’t just leave because they take you deposit in cash). So, that was all pai"
*Waiting to have breakfast for 20 mins is very frustrating. This time may vary depending on waiting people. Waiting too much time for just a plate and a cold coffee. *They charge 5% for credit card. Why isn't it mentioned when booking? It's an additional hidden cost. *Bathroom is very outdated. *Too many mosquitos and other toilet flies all over the room. *Basin which is located in the middle of the room was smelling. *Internet was very poor. I would not recommend this hotel. Definitely not worth money. Ser
"DO NOT STAY HERE! Yes the breakfast is good, however the state of the rooms and security are the worst I’ve ever come across on my budget Central & South American travels!  The lockers are shocking, I could put my arm in to take out any belongings.   The dorm rooms walk out onto a Main Street and have old dingy doors with terrible locks that can be jigged open (you do not feel safe). Our room was broken into despite being locked at about 5.30 am one morning. Money stolen from one of their terrible lockers. "
" someone to look at the lock and find a room for us and never did.  We decided to change hostels and also lost our deposit for the next two nights.   We were sucked in by the breakfast reviews and free bikes. Don’t bother with this place, you’ll also leave with 100 mosquito bites."
"We don't recommend staying here unless you don't mind not getting a good night's sleep. This place is soo LOUD! It seems like a cool place to stay on a budget but don't. There are Sevage Trucks to Garbage Trucks at 6am to the Staff Occupying the Common Areas and shooting around throughout the day, they think it's their place I guess. Not True. The staff also hangs out and sleeps in rooms when they are not occupied, don't wear masks and I don't believe clean the places safely. The maintenance is terrible wit"
…
"The place is in the perfect location,near the ruins and beach, the breakfast is very rich (with fruit and tea). The staff is very friendly and they help you in everything you need. 100% commendable.!!"
"The WORST hotel in all of Tulum!!  This is my WORST Airbnb experience EVER!!  We rented the room with two beds and the room is literally on the main street, you might as well go get a sleeping bag and sleep on the street, as it's the same amount of noise in this room.    One whole wall has no glass, it's just screens, so not only do you hear the street noise, but you hear the nonstop construction noise, you hear the reception area, you hear the bar and pool area as everyone comes into the space to hang out "
"Awful bed, awful room, ok shower, brilliant location for beach but next to a loud loud motorway. Few places to eat at night. Rip off for price. Not much more to say. Laundry service was decent. Room was ready early. WiFi good. Room a hovel though. Should supply mosquito nets. Probably worst place stayed in six months."
"Perfect place for us to stay in Tulum. Outside the city center, you could hear a bit of noise from the busy road, but I've been sound asleep every night. It's very close to the ruins and the beach and bicycles are for free. Jorge was genuine humble, friendly and advised us some great places to visit!"
"Excelente hotel, tiene muy buena calidad en el servicio, la alberca muy bonita, todo muy limpio y en orden, es ideal para pasarla en familia, pareja o solitario, es muy tranquilo y cómodo, lo recomiendo mucho!!"
" receptionist here, just a nice Spanish-only speaking guy that offered to contact Armando, the property manager.  We expressed how unhappy we were with the room, how this was supposed to be a vacation from our stressful work life, but staying here with non-stop honking vehicles outside, construction, music from the bar area below and yelling drunk guests was not relaxing at all.  And Armando pretty much told us 'tough luck suckers,' in less direct words.  The owner refused to speak with us directly.  I woul"

"This hotel is priced as a medium rate hotel in Mexico and offers a slum experience for that price. Filthy dwellings, sewer smells, nice views over dump areas, hazardous electrical wiring in rooms, cold occasional drops as « water » in bathrooms. One would say that Tulum is at that price, but then don’t put Tulum on your travel plans. Overcrowded, overpriced, overrated. It can only be a few years before the place either crumbles under it’s garbage or turns into a high end, luxury hotels place as you’ll find "
"Me sentí como en casa durante toda mi estadía, super limpio y con seguridad 24 hrs.  A 10 min de la zona hotelera y a 1 min del centro. Excelente si buscas algo con las 3B's (;  El personal es super amable y siempre están al pendiente de ti para orientarte (:"
"Hotel novinho em folha.  Provavelmente teve (ou teria) sua inauguração pouco antes da pandemia.  Viajamos em tempos de pandemia (out/20) e escolhemos um quarto compartilhado que acabou sendo inteiro para mim e meu irmão.  Ficou perfeito pra nós aquele quarto inteiro nos dois dias em que lá permanecemos.   Mas digo que, mesmo cheio, seria muito bem adequado e minha nota seria tão elevada quanto.  Como o espaço é novo, ele é bem condizente com as realidades de um viajante solo, seja na necessidade de ter uma "
"Start by saying Tulum is quite expensive. Residencia Gorila offers very decent accomodation right smack in the middle of many beach clubs and restaurants. The rooms are large, they don’t have A/C which could be an issue for some but they do provide a fan that makes for good sleeping. The only observation I would make is that it can be a bit (not extremely) noisy in the early morning. Overall the location and price point are incomparable in Tulum. "
"I know that its not 5 stars hotel, maybe highway behind is very noisy...but...bikes for free! Perfect to reach the beach in five minutes, close to tulum ruins, lovely friendly atmosphere inside, freezer for beers in the kitchen, you can easily use all equipment from that kitchen, breakfast amazing! Best place to spend two days in Tulum! Highly recommended for young people! Do not booked room in centre of tulum, find something close to the beach as all those beaches are so beautiful...like in dreams. "
"The hostel was great. It has comfortable common areas, delicious filling breakfast, with several options available. The common areas were clean as well as the bedrooms. They cleaned the private rooms and badrooms every day. They give you free bikes because the hostel is 2 km far from the center of Tulum, so it was cool. The owners and staff were very friendly and the gests too."
"Solo aceptaban pago en efectivo, no había jabón en el baño (y cuando lo solicite dijeron que no tenían en el hotel), al vencerse la habitación entraron repetidamente sin tocar (tampoco llamaron a la habitación pues no tienen teléfono en las habitaciones). La 3ra vez que entraron les indique que dejaría la habitación 1 hora después de la hora de salida, me indicaron que tendría un costo de $160 extras, con lo cual estuve de acuerdo, pero al momento de pagar el extra me indicaron que el costo ahora era de $32"
"I had the most HORRIBLE stay here due to the construction right outside my room. By about 4 or 5 am, the drilling was so loud my bed was literally shaking, and it sounded like a helicopter was outside my window."
This is one of the few places with a pool on the playa are in Tulum that is not super $$$$. Very small soak pool but that is helpful alternative to beach for our family. People were nice. Right across from beach. Easy access to Aura Beach Club. Room was nice and clean. It was a cross between a hotel and hostel. It is eco friendly solar panels and had a very artistic design. It had a shared common area kitchen and a cool roof top area to hang out. The mattress was closer to futon quality than hotel mattress 
"This place is run by solar energy, there is no AC, but there are fans. rooms are basic but decoration is artful and unique. My room had a balcony with a hammock which was fantastic. Amazing people work here, kind, thoughtful, attentive. You will probably make new friends here too. Across the street is the Aura beach club, all set to enjoy your stay in Tulum without paying the outrageous prices of the beachfront properties ;) - avoid to bring a car here, parking space is very limited. "
"I stayed with 3 of my friends for one night, the hotel is like 10minutes walking to Gitano, Hartwood and these different restaurants of the hotel zone so the location is great! It has a kitchen for all guests, so you can bring your own drinks or food (if you want to), we brought beers and it worked amazing as we spent the afternoon at the pool, the pool is not big but is a nice area to chill.  The room we got did not have air conditionning, however we had a fan, and it was a cool night so it was Ok, I loved"
" out, and was so attentive to us that it seemed we were the only ones there.  There is a roof with a place to chill out as well, but we did not use it, however it was nice as well. I think if you are planning to visit Tulum and don’t mind not having neither ocean view or beach area at the hotel, this is the best option!!"
"What a lovely find! This gem of a place is about 20 minutes away from Tulum, down a dirt road in the middle of the jungle, a 5 minute bike ride from the Dos Ojos cenote. It's remote, private, and really feels like you're in your own jungle retreat, while at the same time it's just a 2 minute walk to the lobby and on-site restaurant. We didn't encounter a lot of wildlife or insects during our trip, but they are certainly there, and because the whole resort is solar-powered don't expect to be able to plug in "
" attention, and flavor into his dishes, and warranted a trip back to the restaurant a second time during the trip! Will certainly be coming back and staying during our next trip to Tulum!"
"My boyfriend and I picked this hotel because it was affordable and close to both town and beach. We did not expect it to be as nice as it was considering the price. Ko’os hotel is in the middle of the Aldea Zama park, which gives the sense that you are really isolated from the city even though the center is only a 20 minute walk away. Also, just behind the hotel there is a square with a couple of really nice restaurants, that take you away from all the excitement of the city and really allows you to relax. "
 I will for sure book this place !
"Fui con amigos y terminé con una familia entera! El ambiente del hostel es precioso, personas muy amables, un montón de actividades y tours. La estructura del hostel es increíble, una pequeña jungla en pleno centro de Tulum. Ubicación recomendable para poder recorrer a cualquier hora. Planeo volver pronto para visitar a mi familia mexicana💛 gracias Staff por tanto amor! 😍🤗"

"Parece um hostel e não um hotel   Cheiro ruim na entrada do hotel e recepçao  Recepçao adaptada com pia e pratos sujos (fica com cheiro ruim de resto de comida) Não tem elevador, então se você tem 4 malas vai ter que subir tudo de escada.   As fotos não correspondem a realidade "

"I can deal with a certain degree of shabbiness at a certain lower price point. The blood stains on the sheet on one bed were a bit more troublesome. Exposed electrical wiring...come on. And cigarette burns on the bedside table.  One reason I chose this place was that it has a pool, except that at the moment the pool isn't useable.   The person manning the front desk was willing to be helpful, but didn't really seem to know much when I asked questions.  Absolutely the worst was the noise. One night guests ca"

"I stayed here for 1 night, my last night, the front desk lady was wonderful and helped me with the best advice to get to the airport inexpensively. Highly recommended, especially if you want to stay on the main city drag."
"Unfriendly, rude staff! Average price, okay location but cold shower. Wifi in the room but not very strong! Paid for an extra person but simply got bed space so bring your own towel and toilet paper as the gentleman at reception told us if we want another towel, get another room!"
"Stayed here two Week's , it was close to everything , the Town the Dive Shop the Restorantes , the Town is very Noisy at night but this place is Not Bad for noise , they have securety in place at Night , the Staff are very Nice the Rooms are very Clean ."
"I didn't stay here.  I checked out a room and it had that smell that can be in a lot of tropical places, maybe mold, bug spray, or something.  It was a lower corner room so all the rooms might not have the smell.  I have allergies and don't do well with mold and bug spray so I'm sensitive to those things."
"We stayed in this hotel for one night.  The room was not really clean and the furniture worn out. Bathroom broken with slippy floor.The guy at the reception was very unfriendly and it was a challenge to get even a roll of toilet paper. Not to talk about an additional towel. Sorry for being your guest, guys!   Next door there is a budget hotel as well with reasonable prices and good service.   Location is good."
"Clean, but good golly, who picked out the lousy mattresses this hotel uses? Never felt so many springs in a mattress before! Other than the mattress on the bed being the worst I've had the experience of sleeping on, it served it's purpose of having a roof and A/C. For 450 pesos, not a ""deal"" in the least. For 50 more pesos, other hotels will give you a better mattress to sleep on for a much better sleep. Spend the extra 50 pesos and go some place that will give you a mattress that does not let you know wher"
"Definitely a budget hotel,we booked this hotel last minute so we didn't really look around for other options.We just wanted a place to sleep. The price is moderate, the rooms are spacious with two double beds, the best feature about this hotel is the location close to restaurants, bars, shops etc. and also safe parking area. The rooms are outdated, nothing much , very simple. The room had a.c and fan. My biggest complaint is that the bedsheets look very worn and toooooo THIN! If you are looking for great, e"

They arranged for a local restaurant to deliver food each night and morning. Helped the kids with any requests they had and we had a ball. It was like we were part of the family before we left. I even forgot a Bluetooth speaker at the hotel, which normally means bye bye speaker in Mexico. The manager drove to the restaurant we were having lun"
Very basic (and clean) room with good wi-fi and good clean pool (its deep but there is a shallow section). Ernesto and the other staff were super nice. One thing that I noticed that I liked was that all of their linens were dried on clothes lines (love that smell!).  The new restaurant next door was very beautiful with amazing food! In fact I would drive from Tulum just to eat there. The village is about 21 kilometers from the hwy 307 intersection in Tulum so if you don't have a car you will need to take a

This is a decent hotel similar to Motel 6 or Super 8 in the states.  The room is spacious and clean. The staff is also friendly. We ran out of hot water after 10 minutes of shower. The address shows Tulum but it’s really far from it. It is located in a small town about 30 minutes from Coba and 15 minutes Tulum.  We arrived at night and we couldn’t find any restaurants to eat so we drove to Tulum for dinner.  Wifi signal is strong in the room.  Good value hotel for Tulum.
"Was here for 2 days after chichen itza/merida. The location is great. I had my own car and with tulum 20 minutes away to the east and coba, chichen itza, Valladolid to the west its actually quite central. Trips to playa del carmen are Very doable aswell. Good rooms, good shower, good pool, Very friendly staff! And affordable! Minus? Only 1 channel on the tv but if you're on holiday you shouldnt have time to watch it anyways :) "
"Alleen maar positieve woorden! Cobanitas heeft een perfecte locatie, waarbij je met 2 minuten op het strand staat van Tulum Beach. Prachtige eco huisjes met heerlijke buitendouche. Het is overal mooi schoon doordat de lieve dames van de boot eco lodge elke dag schoonmaken. We werden heel fijn ontvangen voor Paula, waar we gedurende de dagen heel makkelijk en plezierig contact mee hadden. Cobanitas is echt nog het ‘originele Tulum’, een mooie plek voor een mooi prijsje. Zeker de moeite waard!"
We booked our lodging and received excellent communication from Andrea at Co.Banitas. We unfortunately had to postpone our trip due to COVID and look forward to rebooking and staying at Co.Banitas in the future!
"Este hotel ecológico es muy lindo, se siente cómo estar en medio de la selva, me tocó instalarme en la habitación tío ático y me fascinó la vista, te ofrecen fruta y café cada mañana y lo mejor es que está a metros de la playa, y a muy buen precio, sin duda regresaría."
"Guys who run it are all so helpful and accommodating, amazing atmosphere and delicious breakfast. Would stay again and recommend to others. Great price, great location too just set back off the Main Street. Will only get better here"
"I arrived at the hostel very ill. The four guys running it, wanted to help anyway possible. This included bringing me toast and tea in bed, fresh bedding, checking i was ok and expressing they would get me anything I needed. The hostel is new, with lots of passion and love put into it. The roof top area is great for hanging out (covered area too) the drinks are cheap, the breakfast is sweet, the guys even make fresh jams! The pool is prefect, and clean. The dorms are clean and beds comfortable. Good working"
"My small family of 3 and our friends' family of 6 stayed at Casa Xanath last week and we loved it. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. A/C units in the rooms were great. Our kids loved the pool which is open until 10pm. The hotel is right in the heart of downtown with amazing places to eat close by. It's around the corner from the ADO bus station which is super convenient. We rented a car during our stay in Tulum which allowed us to explore cenotes, the ruins, and the beach. Casa Xanath had free p"
" disconnect then Casa Xanath is perfect.   If you're looking for the Four Seasons or Aloft, this isn't your scene. But our rooms were clean, had a little kitchen, and the price was very affordable. I'd recommend this place to anyone who isn't a snob.  We loved Tulum and Casa Xanath was definitely one reason why."
…
Terrible! Avoid it. Sharing the same wall with a very noise disco - the buzzing noise last till 2:30 every morning. The entrance door is just opposite to crashed sex bar…No room cleaning. Big disappointment. Would not recommend anyone who wants to have at least some rest.
We stayed three nights in casa xanath and were really very happy with the accommodation. It's located conveniently close to the main street of tulum town but on a quieter street.   Staff were so friendly and helpful.  There was a simple continental breakfast which set us up for the day.    Our room was spacious and cleaned daily. Air conditioning and fly screens meant we could open up for fresh air also.  We had a kitchenette which was really nice to prepare food and keep fruit and drinks in the fridge. The
"Nuée's space was fantastic for all of Acrotravels acroyoga adventures! We literally played everywhere possible and the staff was super friendly (they even clapped for some of the poses we got into!) Literally anything we asked for they made sure to help us out with. All of our expectations were met when staying in this space. You'll find it just as appealing, we're sure."
"A zárt széfből rabolták el az összes készpénzünket a hotel dolgozói, mert van kulcsuk a széfhez! Hitegettek 24 órán keresztül, hogy kifizetik,  de csak az időt húzták  nem kártalanítottak!

Easy Bike rental assistance by the host Sylvia. Only negative, the pool was ice cold. But the stay was pleasant. I’d recommend staying at this place."
"The place is beautiful and super clean. Amazing pool super chill.    But what really makes the place feel like home is the staff.   From the moment you come in you feel welcomed. They make cute animals shapes with the towels that make you smile when you enter your room after a long day.   For breakfast, Gricelda and Jen are in the kitchen- (order the mexican style eggs). You can tell by the smile on their faces they cook with love. The staff that serves is amazing too.   I asked for hot sauce and when they "

"My wife and I stayed 4 nights here and had a great time visiting Tulum for the first time. It’s a beautiful property and the staff was exceptionally accommodating. Located inside of the archeological zone which is a protected forest and minutes walk to the ruins. This isn’t hotel zone in Cancun, but it’s also not meant to be. Gorgeous property, amazing beach, fun beach club and restaurant, very reasonable price point for food and drinks compared to Tulum restaurants/bars/clubs/etc…, cold A/C, hot water and "

Anyway, the staff at Mediterraneo were so kind and helpful. My husband and I were on our honeymoon. They decorated our bed and just made sure we had everything we needed.

No airconditioning, just a portable fan, which is of no use (just making the already warm air blowing around).   The beach club is ok; the drinks are nothing special. Our apérol spritz was prepared with an already flat prosecco without bubbles. For 200 MXP an absolute rip off!!!  The food at the restaurant close to the reception is not recommendable at all! Th"

"This is a beachfront hotel that used to be Zazhil Kin and is under new management and construction. The current price, around $100/night reflects the minor inconveniences and construction noise. This is not an Americanized resort. It is a simple Tulum style hotel.   All of the staff here are friendly and helpful. Many of them went out of their way to help me out, especially the waiters. Santos really stood out and was knowledgeable about the menu, professional and very open and friendly. I had a lot of fun "
 reasonable prices and I enjoyed speaking with a few of the waiters when they were not too busy. Alex definitely stood out and helped me out a great deal. I am sure that Alex also has a bright future ahead of him should he stay in Tulum.   I extended my trip here by 4 nights as the set up was great for my needs. I would definitely return.

"While the location of this hotel on a beautiful beach is great, and it has high potential, there was just so much wrong with it under the surface that it felt more like a 2* stay rather than a proper resort - and was not worth the price. There was no hot water in the showers during my 6 nights there (two different rooms), no water pressure either (trying to wash your hair in a dribble is not fun). Only wifi in the lobby which barely works, and no phone/data signal in the rooms either. Towels and bedding had"

A male staff member was extremely rude to my friend when she was asking about a hairdryer (surprise surprise - not available).

"Right behind bus station making it convenient , close to center  and eateries   is this hostal, can be slightly loud at night but staff are friendly and helpful and place good for a budget stay, nice kitchen "
"We went there to get some ice coffee. We asked both in English and in Spanish for it, and the waitress/hostess seems to understand our request.  We waited for over 15 minutes for the coffee to arrive, which were in vain because it wasn’t an ice coffee but a hot one. When we asked why is it hot she replied that they didn’t have ice :/  We up and left at the moment."
"This hostel is directly behind the bus station, making it easy to arrive/ depart Tulum.  It's laid back and cheap, with very helpful workers.  It was a bit loud at night, but not rowdy. It's a good budget option.  I recommend renting their bikes to cruise around."
"This is a small Hostel run by a local family. They make you delicious breakfast every morning and the Hostel mama is by far the friendliest person I met, always a smile on her face and never too tired to answer your questions. I really enjoyed staying there, although they only have two bathrooms for the whole Hostel which can be a little annoying. Nice atmosphere, friendly people, I can really recommend this place! Oh and super super Central 👌🏻"
"This accomodation is so beautiful. The lobby, the garden-paths, the poolside all have this peaceful tropical vibe and sounds.   And then I didn’t even talk about the room! So tasteful and spacious! Bathroom is perfect and the beautiful lights in the room are adding to the atmosphere.   Perfect bed & shower.  Ultra friendly staff & great location in the centre of Tulum.   In short: I totally recommend!! "
"Great oasis in Tulum City with a small pool and a good breakfast bar. Does not serve lunch or dinner yet, but are working on to be able to do that.  2 yoga classes each day where the morning class at 8.30 is free of charge for all residents. Massage is also available for a cost.  A tip is to rent a scooter if you are planning on spending most days by the beach.  Juan Carlos, Raul, Estela and the rest of the staff is extraordinary and will help you with anything and everything. They made the stay for us a 5/"
"SHORT STORY SKIP IT.   A solid modern day motel. The rooms are simple and clean. Simple and just straight to the point. There aren't any draws for your clothes or irons, microwaves or coffee makers in the room. The mini bar consists of Chips, nature bars, Oreos, water, coconut water and Herseys cookies and cream. Upon arrival it wasn't the warmest reception. I felt like I was walking into a room of gossiping women. It was odd but they weren't rude.   They give you a number to text on whats app should you ne"

 issues of every day. My check out day was just ridiculous. Long story short. I got pen marks on a sheet and a pillow case. With no push back I agreed to pay for it. My cab had to wait 25 minutes resulting in me having to pay extra because Estrella tried to rob me. Her manager told her it would cost $18.00 usd  $15 for the sheet $3 dollars for the pillow case. Fine I agreed. Between my mini bar and the sheets Estrella tried to charge me over $800 pesos which I caught. WhEN I asked her she said it was severa
"We booked this hotel for one night via Expedia, but when we arrived they said they were overbooked and had no room for us. They also claim to have contacted Expedia to say the booking was cancelled but that is not true.  In the Expedia reviews I can see this has happened before to someone else. I think this hotel gives discount rates on internet sites but if another customer shows up and pays the full rate then they just cancel some internet bookings.  So if you do book this hotel don't be surprised if you "

"Excelente habitación, en el centro de la ciudad. Cerca de todo. Farmacias, oxxos, restaurantes. Esta en la avenida kukulkan que es la que llega a la playa en 10 minutos. Los mejores precios de tulum. Cuartos con todos los servicios, buen Internet. Excelente atención del personal "
We stayed for one night and took the bikes into town ...the rooms are very large and beautifully decorated with a large bathroom and shower...great value! Staff was very helpful and accommodating. There are a few restaurants walking distance in case you don't want to drive or take the bikes. 
"What сould be hidden under the mask of these beautiful photographs of this paradise place ?!  Indifference and complete insensitivity to the hotel guests !!!  I would like to share with you the following information:  On the second day of our stay in the hotel, around 12:00 a.m., my phone was stolen at the hotel entrance !!!  On the fifth day of our stay in hotel, in the daytime, we discovered a hotel worker leaving our CLOSED room (he explained this intervention by checking for hot water). After this meeti"
"I stayed there with 3 of my German friends. The hostel really suited our needs, the receptionist is really ambitious kind and helpful! The free breakfast is good: toast and eggs and lots of fruits. The hostel is really quit which is perfect to chill!"
"A dispetto del titolo la struttura ha invece un grande punto di forza nella posizione, abbastanza vicina alla avenida principale. Gli elementi positivi sono finiti: sporco, incasinato, disordinato, senza aria condizionata (rotta), con uno staff dai comportamenti ambigui e per nulla collaborativo. In più è pure caro. Molto sconsigliato"
"Me encantó el lugar, cómodo , limpio, rodeado de selva, está muy cerca de las ruinas , me rentaron una bicicleta y todo me quedó muy cerca, la alberca limpia y grande, los anfitriones amables y hablan inglés, recomiendo ampliamente Quedarse , sin duda volveré."
"La verdad que el hotel es una maravilla secreta. Desde las habitaciones hasta el servicio de los trabajadores fue absolutamente increíble. Es mi segunda ves en Tulum y tengo que admitir que aveces el servicio puede ser un poco flojo, pero aquí nunca tuve esa experiencia. Si visitan a Gramercy, les recomiendo preguntar por Otoniel, Nayeli o Elezar para un gran servicio."
Un lugar rodeado de selva y el canto de diversas aves . El departamento nuevo todo de estrenar super limpio sin lugar a dudas regresaría. Los anfitriones muy amables y serviciales . Disfruté muchísimo nadar en la alberca muy amplia.
"we had no microwave or toiletries. We payed for 4 weeks but only stayed 3. You must give them 2.000pesos deposit for the AC.,usage will be deducted. Wifi was intermittent or none at all.We had a leak from the roof on our bedroom & living room . No privacy in living room or kitchen because hallway windows were bare. No hair dryer,no ironing board,no paper towels or toilet paper.A cleaning fee is imposed of 350 pesos."
"In August 2021, the 3 of us went to spend the afternoon on the beach. First impression was that this hotel was run down, nobody was there, it was a ghost town. It was a clear sign, I should have walked away, However the staff was very friendly, convincing me to stay for the afternoon, a major mistake. This hotel is listed as a 5 star hotel, In no way or stretching your imagination is the Gramercy a 5 star hotel. On that August afternoon at the beach hotel, We ordered 2 cocktails, 1 sparkling water and 1 shi"
"A completely horrible experience. Firstly, the location is in a bad area of town, and literally next to a big pile of trash. Unfortunately, you cannot see it in a Google Street View, otherwise we would have never booked it. Secondly, the property is not marked in any way. Luckily, the neighbor has pointed us to the right direction, otherwise it is very hard to find the place. Then the worst part: when we got to the place, we were offered a room with one single bed. We are traveling as a family, so the room "
"We headed for the restaurant for dinner only to find the place was closing early.    The sign out front says open until 9, and the guy who turned away other members of our group said the kitchen closed at 830PM.   We arrived at 750 and were turned away.   We had called a few hours earlier to inquire about a reservation, and we told they don't accept them.   The oceanfront dining looked nice, but we were never able to try it."
Ate dinner here after staying in the area several days. Nice ocean front eating but horrible music and AFTER finishing the meal they informed us their credit card machine was down. The waiter was kind and apologetic but the chain smoking manager made me stay as ransom while my wife went to our place to get cash. Will never eat here again
"Very bad experience when we arrived a week ago. After asking, the US manager of this hotel told me first he had no reservations for the night, then phoned the reservation manager who told she had none. I reserved 4 month earlier and showed the mails. Despite that, I was shown two rooms in an anti-climax and suspicious way. What a posture. I have been all over the world and never had such an horrible experience. You have one chance to make a good impression. It was a total fail from the persons running this "

"We visited with our family of 3 in November 2017 and it just happened that they were under construction. Arriving at 8 pm in the middle of the jungle and hotel under construction was... quite a story to tell when we got home. (side note to remember- it is a journey down a long and pitted road to find your way here, be prepared for a mile drive of pot holes, we already knew from visit to villas before but it is surprising 1st time) Despite the miscommunication, the manager Aaron found us a room for the night"

One caution the upstairs rooms do not have railings around the stair cases, or at least did not, and that is every mom's worst worry, so if you have kids, stay ground floor. The beach sand was cared for in the morning and the grounds keeper help my 6 year old and I find and open coconuts any time of day on property. He even helped me find materials to make a wreath to send some ashes out to sea. Although we had a hi"

"I fell in love with this place.  It's magic by the sea!  Best view ever from my room.  The manager Aaron is beyond outstanding both in his level of customer service and attention to details.  The restaurant is beyond delicious.  The place was small enough that you feel like you're part of a family.  I strongly recommend staying here for a peaceful, quiet, Tulum-like experience."
"Una de las peores atenciones de la persona encargada del lugar un tal Gustavo, no tiene modos para atender al turismo. El hotel no es la gran cosa, la zona donde está esta bonita pero es muy complicado moverte a algún lugar. Deberían de darte algún mapa con lugares cercanos y sobre todo de taxis ya que es muy complicado que te den servicio."
"We stayed at Loba for 3 nights and absolutely loved it. It’s a small, cute, modern looking hotel nestled between the town and the beach resorts in Tulum. The bed was extremely comfortable, it had a very nice bathroom, and cool balcony. The rooftop pools were cute and nice place to relax and meet the other guests in the hotel.   The hotel was in a pedestrian area of cute shops and restaurants making it easy to find nice quick meals for breakfast, lunch, and a dinner. There is also a bike rental place within "

"Conveniently located, if you want to be in town, with secure access and off street parking. The owner arranged to have someone meet me and escort me to the parking and the unit which was as depicted in the photos which is not always the case. The rooms were large and airy and a convenient open balcony off the lounge to enjoy a beer after a day out. There were a couple of issues. The fridge/ freezer unit was not working properly but within 15 minutes of my complaint a large bag of ice was delivered which bol"

I continued to precede with check in and then I met Nicholas. Nicholas preceded to cough 😷 with no mask on and without covering his mouth MULTIPLE TIMES. I felt uncomfortable, so I asked him if he can COVER HIS MOUTH. Not put a mask on, but to use manners. Nicholas processed to tell him that he’s not doing EITHER and"
"It’s imposible to sleep before 2 or 3am because of the party. Check-in will take minimum 30 minutes (if you’r lucky). The room charge was too high for what it is (600mx 30us), and they say breakfast it’s 8:30 am but luckily starts at 9"
"Party-place definitely so if you're not into that forget about this place, I've been welcomed for a great member of the staff (GABRIELA) she was kind and helpful from first minute, breakfast is good for the money u pay and dorms are just fine not to expect something great... Would I come back?? Just for the weekend thought "
"Straw hat is for sure a party-place, so if you're not into parties, this is not the place to stay. The dorms are fine for the price, however the pipes for the ac are leaking in some of the dorms, which causes the beds and the electric outlets to get wet. Overall a fine experience, but getting involuntarily waterboarded in the middle of the night is not fun. Especially not if it's followed by electrocution. If you do stay here though, make sure to hit the bar before you hit the bed, so you'll be properly kno"
"Very bad experiance! The pool was out of service (even they told us bevor checkin, that the pool is ready to use), there is no warm water, the bathroom is very tiny and you cant even turn yourself. Furthermore, the staff is not friendly, there were only dudes and no woman and the aparment was dirt..."
"1. Bad service. They throw up some water at 11 pm to their clients in order for us to leave downstairs. They don't consider their clients, feedback, don't care. Definetly don't recommend this bar to anyone. They don't deserve it. Avoid it 100 %. "
"Hi there.  I just left a property early due to several major issues.  I checked in to straw hat hostel in Tulum in yesterday.  I booked a private room.  Upon arrival, I was shown my room I asked for the remote for the AC and was only given it to turn on my unit and I was not allowed to keep it in the room.  This is very unusual for a private room and I had to ask for it from the front desk anytime that I wanted to make a change to the temperature.  There was not hot water on feb 22 or feb 23.  There is an i"
" AT 3 AM, WAKING ME UP!   I left this morning and asked for a full refund for me entire stay.  The manager would only try to give me free breakefast for my troubles (which breakfast is already free).  I would like a full refund of my money from this hostel and I will also file a dispute with my credit card company if I do not get reimbursed."

"THIS HOTEL IS UNSAFE. One of the wait people stole money from me and the worst part of the situation was that management didn't even care that it happened! To me, this is horrible management. Other staff made the effort to return my money to me but management couldn't be bothered and I am quite sure that they will do NOTHING about the waitperson who stole my money. He will still be working there when you go. I DO NOT recommend this place. They not only hire thieves but they don't care if their staff steals "
"No Wifi !!!! and yes it still exists…  The rain in your room, on your bed!    Execrable beach waiters, especially Jesus…  A tyrannical boss! who prefers transient customers to those who stay.  Bad energy….in this place… run away………………………………….."
"We were literally just walking down the beach on a day trip to Tulum from Playa Del Carmen.  We stopped at BT Live Tulum to use their restroom and were greeted by Eusebio who invited us to stay and have a drink at the beach bar.  We loved it so much that we stayed the night! Michelle in reception and Aurelio in the restaurant were so helpful and welcoming. Our room, #3 was charming and literally right on the ocean.  We will definitely come back and stay longer next time."
This resort was so welcoming and gave my husband and I the greatest first time experience in Tulum. Michelle and Luis were so accommodating for us and ensured we were well taken care of. The location can simply not be beat. The beach is gorgeous and very well taken care of. If you are looking for an affordable stay in the party zone and to feel welcomed and have a magical experience book your stay here !
"So if you love ""I don't give a damn about other people"" this is the place to be !!   * The party on the beach with loud music  * Party at night in your room, on your terrace, at the hotel restaurant   The owner validates …… and yet a document is given to you during your Check In which specifies: SILENCE AFTER 10 PM  We have more guests in the hotel who come to rest  (Attachment)"
"We stopped for massages at the open air spa at the beach of this lovely hotel, and experienced the most wonderful treatments. The two therapists were so skilled and friendly, and had techniques that were really effective for relieving stress. We’ve had massage treatments in many different countries and places, and we agreed that our treatments here were absolutely stellar - bravo!"
Our trip to Tulum started out on a questionable foot when we transferred from Akumal. The cab driver wasn’t quite sure where BT Live was. I had done some research on both where the resort was and also about the Boca Paila area where the resort was located. My inquiry garnered that it was next to Tita Tulum resort. Couple that with the party reputation the area had and that the resort promoted itself as eco-lodging. Our choice of BT Live met with some trepidation given that we are more familiar with four sta
 until we came to a nearly screeching halt when we saw the patchwork LOVE sculpture with BT Live at it’s base.  We disembarked with our luggage out onto the jammed road only to have to cross it to get to the entrance. Thankfully the guard at the gate stopped traffic long enough making crossing uneventful.  With baggage in tow we entered the somewhat crude entrance to the property. We both looked at each other wondering what the hell we got ourselves into. Our guessing didn’t subside when we saw the receptio

"I enjoyed my stay at the former Hotel Xcanan (now under recent ownership by BT Live Tulum). The room was fine and had most of what I needed. The free breakfast at the BT Live restaurant was very awesome. I went at sunrise and sat out on the deck with my coffee and breakfast. The front desk receptionist, Michelle, is amazing and super kind. My only down mark is the super loud, booming music late into the night. Fortunately, they tone it down by midnight, but then my fellow guests brought the party back home."
"They charge you Ibiza prices to sleep right  next to a very loud generator, don’t respond to messages and then send “dick picks” from WhatsApp that’s been compromised but still the manager won’t talk to you, offer a refund or discount - outrageous stay away!"
"A quiet little gem in the midst of buzzy Tulum — from the minute I checked in, this place was divine. A private lagoon (cenote), darling rooms, and a lovely breakfast. Adriana was especially helpful, as I left my AirPods behind and she took the time and effort to mail them back to me in the US.   Thank you so much! Can’t wait to stay again. xx"
"We chose this location because it’s at the end of the beach road near the Sian Kaan in tulum and has access to a cenote. It’s a very secluded and quite little hotel in the jungle.  Pros: big bed with mosquito net, big room, beautiful antiques, amazing service and staff, quiet nature location. Fresh fruit and coffee in the morning brought to your door. We needed an extra fan for our baby because it was so hot, Jorge at the front desk had one the next morning, our shower wasn’t working well, we had a new show"
"My partner and i booked the hotel and had to cancel our visit shortly before. We wanted to print out the Tourist Card before at home and we got scammed by an untrustworthy Website which we entered our Passport Nr, address of the Hotel etc. So in fear of our safety we cancelled the Trip! Rafa the owner was not only rude he kept on texting me on whatsupp and would not leave me alone. He kept on pushing me to handle out a deal on the side not over booking.com. Even at the end he overcharged us with tourist Tax"
" Hotel is at the very end of the beach road and the road is in bad shape + traffic it can take a white to get back and forth. The beach access for the hotel is like 20 mins away down the beach, it wasn’t walk across access as I thought.    Overall, great stay! I would definitely go back. It’s the Mexican jungle don’t expect luxury. Bring some natural mosquito repellent, burn the copal, enjoy the peace and tranquility!   Much love!"

"With my girlfriend we went there to visit Tulum's area and work on remote so we needed a quiet place with a good location and good wifi for teleconference. Everything was perfect!  Also Rafa the owner and his team are super nice people, always here to help. They gave us super good recommendations for restaurants, cenotes and ruins. We like to find hidden and amazing places with not to many tourists. Their advices were just perfect for that, and they do not have any financial interest in them.  I travel a lo"
My partner and I contracted covid and needed to cancel the booking. The owner Raffaele sent me the rudest message. He was not accommodating at all. I also read several reviews that were bad. Avoid this place like the plague of covid. There are much better properties in the area.
"This hotel is a complete and utter scam.  We were super excited about this place. After doing our research, especially the great pics online,  we booked and paid online (Agoda.com). Then after a long day of traveling, we got to the hotel just to be told that they didn’t have our reservation. We showed them our proof of booking/payment and the receptionist told us that it wouldn’t be honored.  That’s when the real scam started. The staff then told us that we could make a “new” reservation. They then proceede"
"Overpriced hotel as usual for Tulum. You will get a nice looking “design boutique hotel” - at least for now - for quite some money. You almost need a 4x4 to get through the unpacked road to get to the hotel. The bar functions as reception to assign you to one of the rooms around. No elevator. Heavy bags need to go up - maybe the staff will assist. Prices are elevated at the bar, same, as usual in tulum. Rooms look nice but if you look a bit closer everything is done quite cheap, not really professional and "
 money and too less experience / brains.  
 had no choice but to book the room and pay the ransom they wanted.  This place is a scam.  Book at your own risk. They had zero interest in helping us or righting what was clearly not our wrong.

"We stayed at Maya Tulum  and everything was amazing.  This is Mexico and this is a beach resort based on nature wellness and simplicity.  If you want luxury please go elsewhere.  I communicated with the staff before arriving and all of my questions were answered by the amazing staff.  Edgar, Gilbert  and the staff were amazing.  The breakfast was great and you could order omelets if you wanted for a nominal fee. The lighting in the bathroom is soft  but there are mirrors placed strategically outside the bun"

So watch out when your booking says it includes ‘breakfast’, it’s only ‘continental’, which they forget to mention and only tell you the first morning of your vacation. It’s literally toast and fruit. Everything else like any type eggs, cappuccino  or just hot water for a tea costs extra and is quite expensive, e. g. an omelet is $20 CAD! . Used to be all you "

We stayed for one night in a 5 bed dorm because of the central location. We’ve stayed in several hostels around Mexixo and the world. This was by far the worst. Bathroom and dorm were dirty. Staff was very impolite and would not help with any issues. Guests changed rooms and beds like the wanted so that different beds were used from the same person. In the evening arriving guests had to use those. The staff had no idea which beds/rooms were used/occupied.  Loud music till late without respect to other guest

He will also miraculously ""find"" your charger or credit card in trash-bin outside on the balcony to gain your trust and then take advantage of the situation. I felt really unsafe there."

"Es un lugar prácticamente nuevo, con instalaciones de primera y con bonito diseño. La piscina dentro del cuarto es un plus, y la tele es bastante grande y los accesorios de cristalería útiles. A nosotros nos encantó. Eso si, las calles de los alrededores están en pésimas condiciones por lo que moverse por la noche es una complicación, nada más por eso no le pongo 5 estrellas. Ah, y claro, si lo rompes lo pagas. Un caballito para tomar tequila me costó 100."
Do not stay there. Location is the worst and the hotel is nothing like on the pictures. They also are not to be trusted with money (never received a refund) and the staff service is non existent. DO NOT STAY THERE.
"If you want to stay somewhere that looks great but where nothing actually works or delivers the basic functions of a hotel, then this is the place for you.   For all the nice water features, they lack basic things like: handles on the outside of doors, hand soap, mosquito nets, or lights that work. Oh wait! There’s a massive TV strategically placed to hide internet modem that is hanging off the wall, but it also doesn’t work.

"My boyfriend and I traveled to Tulum on our trip to Mexico. We didn't plan to stay in the room long, as we are an adventurous couple and essentially just needed a place to rest and sleep. We chose Andrea's Tulum due to its location, being on the edge of town, and its cheap rate, $30 U.S. dollars per night, however, we paid in pesos. I highly recommend paying everything in pesos in Mexico. Not only is it a hassle for locals to exchange but you get a better rate by paying in pesos.   The room was quaint and c"
" room came with free wi-fi which was spotty but we expected that. It also came with free bike rentals with a deposit that you got back once you returned the bikes which were nice because other places charged for bike rentals. The girl we paid for our room each night was very nice as were the rest of the staff. The hotel is home to a stray mother cat who recently had a litter of kittens. She and her kittens were extremely friendly and welcoming to tourists, letting people pet them and meowing in affection.  "

SOOO NOSY!!! We couldn’t sleep any of the nights we stayed. Air condicioned made such a bad noise and neighbours we so rude playing electronic music until 5 am. Also many people partying in any place and coming people out from de hostel. TERRIBLE IF YOU WANT TO GET REST AT ANY TIME. There’s music and voices al ALL time.
"If you want to stay closer to the beach with walking distance from the ruins this I a good location. Taxi to the center is about 100 MXN so it was really not a problem to go in for dinner and drinks. Me and my friend preferred to stay within walking distance from the beach rather than to be close to bars and nightlife.  The place was clean and we had plenty of space. Shower was lovely with hot water and ample pressure. But three times during our three nights here, we had no water so we had to ask the staff "
"I love all the staff at Hostel Tzunun, Always friendly and helpful. I stayed in a cabin and the bed was comfortable and the hostel had everything I needed, kitchen, bathroom, nice new swimming pool and a beautiful rooftop area where I could practice yoga and also enjoy relaxing with a drink and friends. Hostel Tzunun was reconizable because of the amazing art on the front and I was lucky enough to meet the artist and see him working in progress one day. The hostel is located toward the end of town that turn"
" mellow, the price was great and the hostel was comfortable and clean.  Thank you Tzunun family!"
"The room which we got was very dark, there was almost no sunlight at all in there, it felt a bit like a dungeon and was smelling strange. The AC was so loud that you could get instantly headache from it. Not very nice place to stay while you are on holidays.  When we arrived they told us that if there is a card payment we have to pay extra (I am not sure if this information was included in the booking). Also their prices online are given without VAT, so be ready to pay more than you wanted.   Except the arc"
"Olas has been my favorite hotel in Tulum for over 10 years. I have stayed there at least 5 times and have sent countless friends. Like many have said in their reviews, it was a gem in an ever changing Tulum.   April 8, I brought 15 of my fiends to Olas, for a new mom retreat. All were either pregnant or new moms and we were seeking a restorative weekend.   Over a month and half after booking out the property, the manager informing me that there was a new venue next door that occasionally played music. The c"
" shop from the early morning you can hear a lot of noise of people.  There was a TV in the room which was working as if you don't have a bike you can't do anything around there in the evening. Also as the place is in the forest side, there are lots of bugs around (not only mosquitos). Rooms have a wifi- which is quiet ok.   If you have to go there try to leave as quick as you came :)"
…
" know that she just wanted me to be aware. I appreciated her care and asked her to keep me posted on any developments with the venue prior to our weekend. (to which I got no updates until 1 day prior to arrival).   Based on the tone of the conversations, I was not alarmed and expected some music …   Upon arriving, we discovered that to describe what was happening as “music” was not accurate.   The hotel was now home to a full fledged club that RAGED daily from 12pm to 2am with techno, Deep house and electri"
"We went to Tulum super excited about our staying at the Andrea's hotel.. But what a disappointment! It sound so good with the including bicycles and the price was more then affordable, although it was a bit far away from Tulum..  We arrived to Andrea's around 12:30, and it seamed like the staff were really disturbed by our presence. We weren't able to either leave or bags there or borrow the bikes because of the check-in that was 2 pm.. The personal at Andrea's were really unpleasant and rude and we felt re"

"Just returned to Olas after 10yrs- and the upgrades still ticked all our boxes- beautiful, essentially private beach, peaceful setting, and and eco-friendly, small footprint.  We stayed in the ocean suite with balcony. The room was simple yet spacious. Loved the view, breeze, and sound of waves with the sunrise stirring us awake in the morning (easy transition to the balcony hammock). The staff was very nice and so helpful with excursion recommendations.Meals were so fresh and delicious. The sunsets on the "
"Everything was top notch. The hotel is perfectly located with jungle around it and directly adjacent to the beach. The hotel is a bit secluded so you get peace and quiet, without traffic and without beach clubs.   We stayed in a larger room directly facing the sea with a large spacious patio. The room was clean and fresh. At night we opened the doors to the sea and fell asleep to the waves crashing against the beach. The cool wind made the room always cool and nice.   Dino who received us was super nice and"
" miss their lunch, it was also among the best we ate during our 10 days in tulum. Try their fish tacos, you will love it.   One thing that really made the stay great was that the breakfast was served around a large table where all the guests could gather in the morning and could talk and share experiences with each other. We had the opportunity to meet many new people we would not have met otherwise.   I recommend everyone to stay here when you come to Tulum if you want a nice quiet stay with the best servi"

"I hadn't been to Tulum in four years and was excited to return. I'm so glad we chose Olas! Tulum has really grown a lot in the past few years and it was nice to be away from the crowds and action. The property is just gorgeous and steps from a pristine beach. Our room was lovely and well appointed. The hosts, Dino and Abby, were amazing and so friendly to talk to each day at breakfast - as were the other guests. It felt like a home away from home. Breakfast is included in the rate and their cook is wonderfu"
"Had a great stay. Beach and swimming wonderful. Has such a friendly low key atmosphere. Food and communal dining were great. Had a wonderful tour in the biosphere. Only downside was our room - junior suite. Choose a better one, they’re much nicer"
"Authenticity, it's a rare find but you will find it Olas. Magic place, exceptional crew and food. We found our dream place on earth. You wake up and fall asleep to the sounds of waves. In between, you have a beach so beautiful that it looks like a retouched postcard. But it is real."
Las ranidas suite rooms so amazing. The food is good especially breakfasts I had my food almost every day in the hotel apart from a local fish restautant -I think it's called camello-the yoga studio and the instructor (Victor) was awesome. It is one the best holiday I have ever had. It would have been nice only if they did have a live music some evenings. One night in tulum there was a guy who came from Senegal to play that was just great. I wish he played in the  hotel.  
"This was such a beautiful hotel, a perfect getaway immersed in nature. The access to the beach is amazing and the water is breathtaking. My husband and I tried yoga and it was wonderful. The food was exquisite, and the best breakfasts we had so far. The dining area is absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning view of the beach. We loved it"
"Perfect! I need not say more. Visit las ranitas. It's hard to explain you have to experience it for yourself. Carlos works the kitchen. Let him prepare your Grouper fish dinner, to die for. 👍🏿 The place is relaxing, friendly and very toned down. If you live in a big, busy city, this is where you want to be.  "
"This is a very nice hotel with better than average amenities but they charge you for every little thing and $15 for a margarita is pretty outrageous.  The front desk staff was friendly but provided incorrect and inconsistent information on several occasions that cost us extra. They provided an incorrect password for the hotel wireless, and although I am sure that I was not the only person who went back to tell them that we couldn't log on due to an ""incorrect password"" - they didn't look into it to realize "
" exceptional cost.  The high end suites were very nice, the regular ocean view rooms were no better than other less expensive hotels in the area."
…
"I looked at many reviews before booking our hotel, and for some reason Las Ranitas ended up being my final pick.  Although our room had a wonderful view of the ocean, I thought the location was a little far out, and the actual hotel was just average.  There was little lighting in the room, so it made getting ready difficult.  Also there was no outlets in the bathroom, so I had to blow dry my hair next the bed using my small compact mirror.  Overall, we LOVED tulum, and the hotel was fine for sleeping.  For "
"Ten years later, Las Ranitas is still a super classy and beautiful hotel in a great location. The most breathtaking part of this hotel is walking into the main building/restaurant area because you are slightly elevated, looking down on a beautiful stretch of pristine beach with the most refreshing ocean breeze. I could sit here all day, it's truly that spectacular made even more spectacular by the fact that you usually have it almost to yourself.   The rooms are very comfortable and clean with decent beds. "
" little less seaweed (plus they diligently rake it up every day.) Beach chairs and loungers were always plentiful and you are within walking distance of many other hotels and restaurants.  The restaurant was uniformly good, with delicious breakfast and the best juices and smoothies in Tulum. Their coffee was some of the best we had in Tulum. Lunch was great as well, and I would assume dinner to be the same although we left every night for dinner. It's a more lowkey restaurant without a scene that you find i"

Good cleaning practices following by team on time specially good job 👍 done by Rajeev singh.  Thanks for better maintenance done by Mr Nagedra.  Quick response done by Mr. Vijay pratapgarh singh.  Thanks team
Our stay at the Ginger Hotel has been very pleasant. Everyone has been very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts have been fresh and delicious. The rooms are very clean and well appointed. Rodulfo was a great source of information about local restaurants and travel arrangements. A lovely young man. 
"super cute, little nook in Tulum. Nice, locally-owned place to stay if you are veering away from the expensive beachfront resorts in Tulum. We stayed in the sun room and it was a nice little room. The window however would not lock shut for some reason, but we didn't worry too much since there is a security guy on staff at night and they lock you in the hotel grounds with this giant steel door. There was also a safe and a little minibar with snacks for us.    Our bed was a dbl bed I think, and for my husband"
" offered free breakfast, and the staff was so pleasant. We had toast and eggs. It wasn't a fancy meal, but basic and I have to say– the coffee at their hotel was the best hotel coffee we had in Mexico (and I'm very picky about my coffee).    We rented bikes for some outings and one of our bikes had a bad rear hub that broke within a block of riding. I was sad about it, but the nice woman at the front desk was nice enough to refund us. On that note, the road conditions and traffic in Tulum are crazy, so ride"

"We stayed here a couple of years ago and enjoyed everything about this family-operated hotel.  As the heading states everything here is bright, clean, comfortable, friendly, safe and quiet.  It offers beach access through a partner, fine meals, wifi, great service, directions and recommendations.  Family art and history tastefully adorn their walls.  The hotel is perfectly located a street off the main drag which is close to all the action as well as grocery store, bus and taxi depot but sheltered from the "
"We loved staying at Hotel Ginger. Very friendly staff, big and clean room and tasty breakfast. We would definitly recommend this place to others. We might come back one day, if we ever return to mexico ofcourse."
"This hotel is one block off the main street, and close to shopping and restaurants. Beaches are about 2-3 miles from Tulum's Central District, but are an easy bicycle, bus, or taxi ride. The Ginger is clean and our room had all the essentials, if on the small side. We were on the ground level, which meant the room was dark. Our friends said they're rooms on higher floors were bright but they apparently good more town noise, too. This is a night-life (all night) town and bars have music on their outdoor roof"

The team doesn’t seem to like serving people, they have really bad attitude if you call the receptions, in the dining room, cleaners, bartender etc..  looks like that doing big favor to actually do something for you which is their job.  Rooms dirty, plate of food was taking from the room and placed outside our room door by the stuff and left there for 3 days.  Beach towel hasn’t been given easily, we needed to sign for them.  For the amount we payed we expected to be in a place that will "
I stayed here for two days with my mother and brother. I found the reception a very welcoming one. beautiful decor and great food. The property is over a long beach overlooking the Caribbean Sea. The amenities are pretty good and the food excellent. I recommend it very strongly.
"My family and I really enjoyed our 4 days at the Pavoreal, however there were some negative aspects, such as:  - Recreation crew simply ignored us the 4 days when stopping by each guest to invite for whatever they planned for that day. They literally looked the other side when saw the non-Italian people. We felt bad for it.  - No activities for child. Not once we saw the kids area open.  - No food, fruit, coffee available between lunch and dinner, which is a very negative aspect for family with small kids  "

Hotel is so beautiful, room was comfortable, I loved all the different colours of the bungalows, the location is good, you can either take a taxi or walk 5 min to the main road and take a cheap collectivo.

"Nice beach resort, good service. Not too big which is nice. Mostly Italian orientated with Italian animation team. Food is ok, lots of choice, fruit, vegetables. Room is pretty with good bathroom.  Swimming pool is nice but music far too loud, day and night. Difficult to have a normal conversation. Unfortunately no sea swimming due to sargassum but beach beds are good.  Wifi is only accessible in the lobby area and extremely slow. All round wifi access can be bought (MXP 500). Which for this type of resort "

We went there was a couple one week in march and couldn't have been happier!!! Highly recommended for every kind of vacation, the structure is well equipped also for little kids.  Also, great trips are offered throughout the week (we picked Chichen-Itza, Coba + Cenote and Coco Bongo, all three recommended!) Thank you Pavo Real fo"
We stayed here fours nights.  Room were OK but internet was malfunctioning. The bedroom had no reading lights. Breakfast was two blocks away. The quality of the breakfast was poor. Staff at the hotel was friendly.
Nice place but don't book tours with them.  They use Easy tours.  Bad tours and hotel over charges for them.  Otherwise hotel is good.  Rooms are spacious and clean.  Location is close to town and some good restaurants.
"This property is a low rise building of nine apartments, offering high quality, spacious and comfortable accomodation in the town of Tulum.  The apartments comprise a very large kitchen/dining room, bathroom and bedroom.  The apartments are cleaned daily by a delightful team of ladies and in fact, all staff are very friendly and helpful.  Location is close to town (a few minutes walk) yet quiet at night.  If you opt to stay in Tulum town, I think this hotel is the perfect choice."
"This is a really lovely boutique hotel/ condo. The staff are wonderfully helpful, anticipating what I needed and accommodating me when I’d arrived early in the morning. The reception lounge is beautifully contemporary with free coffee and biscuits.   The rooms were fabulous and modern: living room/dining/kitchen, balcony, huge bed and modern bathroom all done to a high quality. Small swimming pool. Everything is immaculately clean.   Good location - close to Tulum village restaurants but quiet. Included bre"
"The hotel was really nice and the stuff was super friendly. It’s close to town - about 5 minutes walk. The surroundings of the hotel are not the best, especially when there are some works in the other building, but the rooms are great. Huge bedrooms, a lounge with a balcony, fully equipped kitchen and AC. What I was missing is the restaurant in the hotel, as one evening it was raining-really badly- and we couldn’t go out, we were starving for the entire evening. The breakfast is served in another hotel loca"
"The room was very clean, very large with kitchen and all the amenities (not that we ever cooked with all of the great restaurants in the area), A/C worked fine.  Hotel service was great, we were given a few restaurant recommendations that were spot on, and some tips on travelling to the ruins... the free bikes were a life saver.  Nice little pool to cool off in. Would certainly recommend this place"
We stayed for one night in the beautiful accommodations at Palms. Very pretty and clean rooms. We had two rooms. The staff was very pleasant and informative about the various attractions and places to visit. There is a pool which was being serviced while we were there. Very close to fantastic restaurants and the main square. They offer complimentary breakfast—which is provided at a close by hotel (walking distance). Take advantage of the complimentary bikes. A very good experience at Palms.

So clean , the room was soooo so spacious , the bed was very comfortable, bathroom was super clean and modern, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful too. The location was so easy and walking excess to the cute tulum town full of shops. You have to either bike , which the hotel provides , or drive to the beach but totally easy. Breakfast was incredible. More than we expected. We re definit"
"Rooms were great, we had a top floor room with a nice bathroom and kingsize bed.  Breakfast was provided by another hotel around the corner so we had to pickup breakfast coupons each morning. The hot water only lasts long enough for one person to have a shower which was very annoying. The wifi was among the worst I have had in all of Mexico, they really need to swap that router out for a decent one. Staff were helpful and friendly."
"We stayed three nights here, and loved it.  A few blocks from the bars which makes it quiet at night.  Feels very safe with one entrance to the street that gets locked at night.  Staff all very helpful!!"
"We stayed with an extended family and thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful and very well appointed villa that is part of Kasa Hotel Parota. I wish TA would allow to leave 4.5 stars, only a few minor issues taking away from a full 5 star experience.  Kasa Feliz is a gorgeous, well designed and stocked villa. It has everything one can wish for (except dishwasher). The bedrooms and commons spaces are thoughtfully appointed, the kitchen is stocked with every amenity, it’s truly a pleasure to stay there.

" The half star I fell I needed to detract is for a couple of issues that may or may not affect your stay: 1) Wi-Fi is nearly impossible to use no matter how many times the hotel tried to fix it; Between poor Wi-Fi and cell reception, it was challenging to research and book activities, never mind work, as we planned to do; 2) the housekeeping (daily housekeeping was included in the cost and was needed for fresh towels among other things) was a bit spotty. They would not come the days the were supposed to, th"

We had a great time at Kasa Hotel Parota Tulum. We spent a week here for our friends’ destination wedding. The hotel is beautiful and all of the staff were friendly and helpful. The food and drinks were delicious and there was nice variety. 
"My husband and I had the best experience in this hotel. Our reservation included a continental breakfast that way better than I expected.  It is located in an upscale neighborhood between the beach and downtown. It is easy to get around by bike or car. Overall, I highly recommend this place!"
Beautiful and cozy experience. Customer Service was excellent. Restaurant has excellent food menu choices. Shuttle was on time. Ambiance was perfect for couples and adults. Right location and easy to find.
The hotel was exactly what I was looking for; to spend 6 days in Tulum. It was to celebrate my 30th bday with a group of family and friends. The vibes were awesome. I would definitely like to come back sometime. 
"Rosa Del Viento is no more, now owned by Gramercy (next door to the north) who also bought the little hotel Mistiq beach to the south of Rosa. We stayed there 3 years in a row, it’s still there and looks the same but there is a rope across the beach from gramercy to mistiq."
What happened to Kasa’s hospitality and attention to detail? This was our 4th stay here and what a disappointment ! Unfortunately we were transferred here after another disappointing experience at Kasa Puerto Adventuras (did not get room we paid for) Everything has changed from the quality and selection of food to the vibe on the property! On our last night we had to move from our suite to a standard room with no terrace. So the only place for us to settle in was the dining area - because no other area for 
This hotel is currently closed. We were scheduled to stay here first week of Aug and I only found out of its closure by reading the other reviews on TripAdvisor 2 weeks before our arrival date. Hotel never notified me. I had to reach out to them!! They were not transparent and offered no apologies for their lack of communication and for inconveniencing us. We would have arrived without accommodations had I not reached out to them first!! They offered a refund of our deposit or relocate us to a different hot
"Beautiful, Clean, Tastefully decorated. We will be back.The Staff was amazing from Julio that welcomed us to Ricardo that made sure we where safe. Although it was very quite and very peaceful. Perfect place to get back to after a day of hanging around town or the beach. Basilica was the housekeeper she was so sweet had a towel art decor greet us every day. The food and breakfast was very good also."
"Been coming down to tulum for years now and done it a few ways. I keep coming back to posada Luna del Sur because it really has everything you need in the perfect location.

Breakfasts are great! 24hr security, wifi, parking amazing management and ownership to cater to all your needs. I will only come back to stay here!  Thank yo"
I prepaid for four nights and left after only two.  I was having trouble sleeping because the bed was uncomfortable for me and the a/c was noisy and blowing right on me while I slept. The hotel offered to move me to a different room but my back was bothering me by then and I wanted to find a hotel bed. It's a beautiful property and I enjoyed the setting in Tulum centro.  It's about a 1km walk to the main Avenida which is a real treat with all of the different shops and restaurants.  However that is farther 
"Im going to Mexico in 2 days and just found out they canceled my reservation. Now I have to look for another hotel within 48 hours. How is this possible?!?! Never got any email, message or call. Has the hotel closed? No information on their website either!"
"Highly recommend if you are looking for a quiet and relaxing get away at a chic boutique hotel.  The suites are big, clean, well designed, large porches or patios depending on your floor.  The staff were so kind and helpful--very prompt with all our needs.  The pool is gorgeous, swim-up bar is a plus, great happy hour.  The restaurant at the hotel is impressive, the menu was really creative and the food quality and flavor was so good.    Hotel offers bike rentals which are a great and easy way to get around"
"Been staying at this place almost yearly for at least 8 years at this point and everything is always great. Always great to see the same smiling staff as it's a family run business, it really gives everything a friendlier more personal touch.

There's always someone at the door to keep things safe and secure and greet you when you come back in the evening.  Tulum itself is also amazing, the sargassum (seaw"
We used Posada Yum Kin as a base to explore Tulum Beach and other attractions around Tulum. The personal was lovely and the room was spacious and clean. It had a kitchen and fridge. This was very practical as we were travelling with our little one. I can only recommend to stay here.
This is not a review either.  This hotel cancelled our reservation out of the blue for our stay in August and can't get hold of them. Worst still is that they took payment for 50 % of the cost already and can't seem to be able to reach them.  That was so bizarre that they police taped the hotel and shut it down. That now seems to explain why they cancelled our reservation and not taking any reservations. They cancelled ours on June 18th
I highly recommend this hotel. It is a haven of peace 5m walk from the party while being very calm with a magical setting.The service is perfect and the people who work there are fantastic.The manager and the boss are amazing ! welcoming and kind.The waiters and receptionists are very caring. I thank the Luv Hotel I had an incredible end of the year thanks to them
 stay!
Very clean and beautifully maintained. The breakfast was fantastic and authentic. The staff were all very polite and helpful. The pool was perfect for the kids. It was nice to be part of real Mexico and not in some resort that could be anywhere where in the world. It was a short walk to the town but taxis are easy to get. 
 Hotel cancelled my reservations in past few days only 2 weeks prior to trip.  Does anyone know if this hotel has cancelled operations.   Both email and phone are down?  This is more of a question than a rating  
"Checked in, beautiful hotel, very, very nice staff.  We booked five nights due to the excellent reviews online. The morning after our first night, we were awakened around 8 am to police and another person knocking on our door. We were told we had to pack of “right now” and leave. The entire hotel was being evacuated. The staff did not even know why. There was police tape around the property, a big police bus, and armed officers all over the property. Even more disturbing.... when we called the online compan"

"It's a little far from the main street, but still only 10-15mins by bike. The hotel is lovely with beautifully decorated rooms. The price was the same as somewhere else I stayed in Tulum the night before, but this place was 10x nicer."
There are great places to stay. There are great places to party. This place is both. The partying people can actually make the night's sleep difficult as it could be a noisy place. Staffs are great. Location excellent.
 extreme caution.

"TLDR: great in so many ways, unfortunately construction happening on the property for the foreseeable future  My husband and I booked this hotel to get away from everything and get some deeply needed rest and relaxation. Overall plan for us in Tulum was to mainly hang out by the pool in the hotel and in the room reading and relaxing. When I booked the hotel I knew it was in a secluded area, and was okay with having to travel to the beach/downtown thinking that it was worth peace and quiet and not being near"
"This is one of the most unique, beautiful stays of our lives. There's no wifi, nor cell service, so prepare to completely detach! The rooms are rustic, thatched roof huts with private beach access. Considering that you are in the middle of a jungle, it's quite clean and the staff is warm and inviting. Engaging in daily breakfast on the sand is magical. We cannot wait to go back!"
"Great service, wonderful breakfast and excellent location.  We needed a room for one night only and this was an excellent choice.

Everything was perfeclty clean. A big bonus for all the staff: really nice and caring, always ready to answer our hundred questions and always ready to help us in any way. We had s"
"I booked a quick last minute trip to Tulum and thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Las Palmas Maya. My room was spacious, clean, comfortable, and well equipped. The location was ideal and the quick beach access was very clutch. But best of all was Tom, Malika, and the whole team. Traveling alone, they welcomed me graciously and made sure I was able to enjoy my stay. Tom thank you for your hospitality and friendship. I hope to come back soon!"
"We were delighted with our 5 night stay at this hotel. We selected it because it was the furthest property on the southern side of the Hotel Zone to avoid the crowds & noise (music and late night partiers).  Spacious and tastefully decorated rooms. Nice private beach offers full service bar and restaurant. Walking distance (via beach) or short cab ride to restaurants, shopping and nightlife. Friendly staff. Nothing to object to!!"
" the front desk and they kind of shrugged it off but it was honestly a huge let down. Deciding not to spend our vacation arguing with one hotel for a refund and trying to find another, we stayed and just tried to be gone most days.  Being gone most days meant that we either had to rent their scooter or take taxis. Both not great options. Scooter is fine for those that are used to driving one, but still $40 a day and I wouldn’t drive it at night, not to mention there is frequent rain in the Yucatán, and huge"

"We were in Tulum for one night and we were so happy to find this place. We were traveling on what I consider to be a ""normal"" budget (i.e. We didn't want expensive and fancy resorts, but we didn't want cheap hostels either). Our choices seemed to be beachfront hotels that were at least $300 or more (mostly more), or hotels in town that were much, much cheaper but had a lot of concerning reviews. We stumbled onto Posada Luna del Sur and after reading so many good reviews, we decided to make a reservation to "
" purified water direclty in our room (no need to buy plastic bottles outside of the hotel everytime - that saved us lots of time and money). The neighboorhood is safe and it is well located (only a 12-to-15-minute walk to the center of the city). Good way to stay close to the city action. Gracias amigos por este lindo viaje en su Posada, regreseramos! :D"
"My husband and I had just finished the Olympic in Tokyo and was long over due for a vacation after the hell we’ve been through. And choosing this place was exactly what we needed to restore our energy, our minds and our marriage. 10 stars if I could! The food was AMAZING! Waking up to the sound of the ocean, tea and coffee at our door and the natural esthetics are so beautiful, we forgot where we were. I believe we fell in love with El Pez and can’t wait to be back again!"
"I stayed at Las Palmas in Dec 2020 for 4 days with a friend and I was very pleased with the accommodations! Tom, the hotel owner is THE MAN and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. He translated for us and he even made sure I took the right bus back to the Cancun airport on my way out. Compassionate people make your journey that much more enjoyable! Needless to say, I fell in love with Tulum and I will definitely be back very soon!!"
Tom was absolutely the best host. Gave us great tips and ideas for our daily adventures. Tom knows whats happening in the area was able to get us into a sold out event which was amazing! Would stay again! Thanks again for everything.
"This really is a beautifully run hotel. We stumbled across it in October 2020 when extending our stay for 2 nights. We are about to stay here again for a week and are so excited to be back! The rooms are beautiful, the beach is quiet and cared for, all the staff are exceptional. So welcoming, kind, and all round brilliant. Free breakfast is good quality.  Lunch and dinner menu is huge and wonderful. I had amazing octopus one lunchtime! We had stayed at another well known very expensive hotel at the other en"

"We used to be reluctant to write a review because Luv Tulum was our hidden gem, but its clearly quite popular now and for good reason. Super natural, gorgeous cabana stays. immaculately clean, well kept, best stretch of the beach, and the nicest staff. Enough said."
" PayPal. I just assumed that I could pay when we got to the hotel. I had never booked a hotel on Hotels.com that sent a request for money via Paypal so that was new to me. Once at the hotel, they didn't take credit cards and we didn't have enough cash on us to pay. However, the guy at the front desk was very nice and patient and he still got us checked in, even without our payment. He took my passport to hold onto until we came back with the money (this is very standard procedure in Mexico and Central Ameri"

"We spent 6 days at El pez Colibri. It exceeded all of our expectations. The staff was very kind and attentive. They always take care of all the details to make you feel comfortable (from the coffee/tea in the morning at your room to the different and delicious infusions at night). The restaurant is excellent with very good service. Stunning views from our room, which was one of the upper sea view rooms. Contemporary decoration according to the unique and pintoresque environment. Convenient complementary dri"

"The team were absolutely incredible. The buildings were stunning and the service from the staff was brilliant, we were both so impressed. Veggie breakfast buffet was delicious. Will be back in a heartbeat. Highly recommend to anybody. We will be back!"
"We stayed at LUV hotel there in Tulum Beach a few weeks ago and had an amazing experience. After walking up and down the beach and seeing many of the other hotels and accommodations, we felt that LUV was the ideal setting for us. Small, quaint, natural, and stunningly beautiful. The beach was wonderful!  Very quiet and laid-back, exactly what many of us want. They have a very small beach side bar with a wonderful mixologist named Josua. The drinks were outstanding and the overall vibe of the place was very "

Spotlessly clean, huge room, we had suit 12 which is on the ground level right next to the pool which was perfect for our kids. Gorgeous pool. The room also has a lovely private terrace with hammock and chairs. Great air con and hot water, filtered water, well stocked kitchen in the room. Large comfortable beds.

"While my wife and I were taking our first vacation in several years at El Pez, we had a few days of bad weather. (We we’re there during rainy season). However, the staff was absolutely incredible and did everything  within their power to get us to restaurants, schedule excursions, and adjust our plans to make the best of our vacation. The hotel was gorgeous, the food and drinks were top notch, and everyone was knowledgeable and kind. We would recommend El Pez to friends and family, rain or shine!"
Everything was perfect!  Our room was beautiful and the staff is wonderful. I loved the communal space for cooking and meeting with Tom and other guests. This is a treasure tucked away in a beautiful setting inTulum.  I look forward to returning to visit this area and staying at Las Palmas Maya.  Tom is the perfect host and provides so much information to help you have the best trip ever.   I will never forget my stay and can not wait to return. I fell in love and will be back.
"From the second we arrived at Kan, we felt like family. The staff is all incredibly helpful and attentive. Jorge answered any and call questions we had, recommended places to visit & eat during our stay. He was a huge part of making our trip as good as it was. The entire staff always has a welcoming smile on their face. Kan looks JUST like the pictures advertised, but better. The grounds are immaculate, well maintained & incredibly clean.  The pool area is a beautiful lush jungle feel with drink service & v"

"Thank you once again to Tom and all the staff for another wonderful week at the Posada, our seventh stay! The standard of the accommodation is still so high...the most comfortable beds, spotlessly clean rooms, lovely breakfasts on the roof terrace etc.  We weren't always lucky with the weather this visit, but having lovely accommodation made it so much more bearable! I must make mention of the map that Tom provides. What a lot of work has gone into this information packed map! We used it all the time and it"

"I spent a week last month here, and it was simply paradise. Glad to book with the hotel. Great view, amenities, and the staff were super friendly. Shout out to Efrain and Denise, who made it phenomenal. Hotel and restaurant highly recommended"
"The entire stay here was amazing. This was my first stay in the area and could not have asked for more. The people here are more than happy to help you with any troubles. Furthermore, their knowledge of the area is extensive, making it a huge plus as a first time visitor. Genuinely, I would give another star if I could."
 morning.  The 24 hour security is a nice secure feeling to Kan.  We spent 7 nights at Kan on our honeymoon and first time in Mexico and we could not have asked for a better experience.  We fell in love with Kan and cannot wait to come back!
"Luv Tulum far exceeded our expectations. Beautiful boutique hotel with gorgeous rooms. We stayed in one of the ocean front rooms and it was heaven. Lovely beach presence. Great simple breakfast in the mornings. Amazing drinks at the bar. The service was fabulous by everyone we met, particularly by Juan and Carlos. Will definitely be returning to Luv Tulum on our next visit!!"
"This is my 4th tomemin Tulum, 3rd time at Luna Del Sur. (daughter, family, and now sister)   The hotel is clean and perfect for my needs, the  breakfast is great and staff is helpful. (Staff is amazing and long term which says a lot to me about the hotel (important to me) - I saw the same staff this time as 5 years ago, and amazingly, they remembered me also). The hotel does all they can to respect the environment, and while it’s not “fancy” or unnecessarily I pscale, it’s perfect in its offerings.   Tom ha"
"This hotel has an excellent location with a great ocean view and beach access! Service of the hotel staff was beyond expectations starting from the check-in, everyone was greatly helpful and made my stay exceptional! Special thanks to the concierge team Arturo, Seima, Denisse & Gilbert! Can’t wait for my next stay!"
"Myself and 3 friends stayed at Las Palmas Maya, extending our trip everyday that we could! The rooms/cabins were very clean, hot and high pressure shower, comfy beds etc...  The highlight was Tom, the hotel manager. He made our stay the best possible! Organising trips, excursions and giving us all the best recommendations for beaches, bars and restaurants. I will without a doubt stay here on my next visit to Tulum! I can’t thank Tom enough for everything he did for us."

The perfect mix of beach luxe, seclusion while still being in walking and easy bike rides of all of the activities and shopping on the beach.

They organized Covid testing for us and made it so stress free. The hotel itself and the position in the cove is hands down the best spot. Food at"
BEST VALUE along the beach!!! My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon in Feb 2019 and again in Nov 2020 and both stays were amazing!  Las Palmas Maya is a beautiful quaint gem just across the road from the beach (beach access is only 2-3 min walk from the hotel). A small hotel with an amazing staff offers plenty of quiet privacy for those wanting to get away from the sometimes crowded streets and restaurants. Amazing wifi and completely green and off the grid for all the eco-friendly travelers. The hote

The pool, the service, the food are all perfect. The balance between the pool and the cenote are amazing! I have so many things that I want that I want to say, but just go! You won't regret it.

"My experience at El Pez was amazing! Everything was beautiful! The ocean views, decor, friendly service, food, and beach front bungalow met my high expectations. All of the staff were great, but I have to give a special mention to Seima and Arturo. They personally took great care of us by making private transportation arrangements and providing recommendations to help us plan out our day.   Icing on the cake was a surprise birthday welcome! I would hands down visit again. 10/10 would recommend   Beautiful -"
 tours or excursions you'd like to go on. He ensured both our trips were comfortable and amazing and we're looking forward to seeing him again for our next stay.
Kan was an amazing weekend getaway. Beautiful architecture set with intention to preserving nature. Wonderful small cenote next to the bar. Very relaxed environment which is what we wanted and great costumer service. Very close drive to the beach “party area” but far enough away if you don’t want the party vibe.
Alberto was amazing! My husband and I went to El Pez for dinner.  We were looking for somewhere intimate for dinner. Alberto took very good care of us! Very attentive and very nice! Thank Alberto for a wonderful experience!
Came here to celebrate our baby moon. Great staff. Needs a little cooler AC but we love the environment and the low key vibe KAN provides. I really loved the nature and will be returning back. Thank you!
"We have spent 3 terrific nights at El Pez with my girlfriend during our Yucatan road-trip. El Pez is a smaller boutique in Tulum and it’s one of the most beautiful boutique hotels we’ve ever been to, with exemplary service.  All of the hotel’s employees are extremely nice and helpful and they really do a great job in making your stay as pleasant as possible.  The room price does not include any meals but the staff prepares coffee every morning and tea every afternoon, which they put in front of your door, s"

"What a fantastic luxury boutique hotel! The setting is stunning- right on the beach and so close to the Tulum Ruins (a 15-20 min bike ride) and close to town where most bars and restaurants are (15-20 min car ride). The hotel itself is picturesque and intimate- just how my husband and I like it.  We stayed in a room overlooking the ocean , designed in true Tulum style. However, what really made our stay and time truly amazing was the staff and team at Mi Amor and Mi Amor restaurant. The concierge team- Efra"

Also, guests of Mi Amor gain hotel/beach access to Le Zebra Hotel, their sister property where you can enjoy beach day beds and beach access in town."

"This place was everything we wanted it to be. The setting is beautiful overlooking the sea from an infinity pool. The staff was incredible. Our first server, Brisa, made us feel incredibly welcome and greeted us by name from the start. I also recommend a short walk to their sister hotel, Mezzanine, for dinner."
"We had such an incredible stay at Mi Amor at Tulum. The staff were so helpful, patient and accommodating for all our requests. The food at the restaurant was amazing and the service too. I surprised my partner with a proposal in a private cabana by the beach and the staff assisted me with the surprise, decorations, photos and made it the most amazing and memorable experience. Definitely would recommend 10/10."
"Wow! The most amazing and beautiful experience we have had while in Tulum! Our waiter, Ricardo, went above and beyond to make my fiancés birthday dinner a night we will never forget. Thank you Ricardo!"
"Lovely hotel - staff all very friendly and helpful. Clean rooms and common areas. Comfortable bed and large bathroom. Tasty food and drinks from the restaurant. It was my birthday and the staff made a cake (looked just like an orange) and hung a Happy Birthday sign above our bed. Would recommend anyone stay at Mi Amor!  On the downside, the sorgassum seaweed was really bad this time of year (late May 2022) and we couldn’t spend any time at the beach or in the ocean."

It was hands down the BEST experience I’ve ever had at a hotel!!  The room (room 10!) was breathtakingly beautiful, with a gorgeous hot tub on a corner balcony that overlooked the ocean. We could see the sunrise from our bed and saw so many shooting stars at night while lounging in our hot tub with delicious margaritas! The room was incre"

Beach access and access to use the other hotels’ facilities (from the same group) were awesome. I will definately stay here again."

On first day our door frame broke, and after numerous complaints to reception, it was never fixed.

Just north, Casa Malca has a truck-mounted machine that cleans the beach daily, but Gramercy just seems to rake it now and then. We swam in the ocean, but it was like getting a seaweed scrub.  The room was great, bed and bath were fine. The staff provided coffee every morning at 7A even though we only requested it the first d"

"What a great place! I had so much fun! The location is excellent, it’s towards the end of the strip but still close a walking distance to some restaurants and bars, although I’ll still recommend to get a scooter or bicycle (they rent there). If you goes a bit north it’s just so much noise and mess. The hotel staff is so personal and warm, you can text the front desk on WhatsApp lol, they answer fast Emmanuel was extremely friendly and the manager Juan.

We only had a few nights to get away and from the moment we arrived at Gramercy it was instant relaxation. We came away from our brief stay feeling so refreshed! The food was wonderful and Efrain in the restaurant made us feel especially well looked after.
"Magic, great team dedicated to make our stay unique, great oceanfront villa and a romantic dinner that was perfect, on the beach, with an exclusive Chef to follow our four-courses. I strongly recommend Gramercy Tulum if you want to make an unforgetable trip."
"Maybe once or twice in a lifetime, the avid solo traveler stumbles into a glimpse of heaven. I did at Gramecy in Tulum. Not only Gramecy resolves the difficult balance of being just far enough to be secluded, yet close to bustling cutting edge action. Something happens at Gramecy, that beautiful people flock to their shores. This is a big plus for the solo traveler. Management & staff at Gramecy are gracious, and very competent. This hard to find combination translates into freedom with ease, for making new"

Ivan will make sure your stay is always top notch. Sonia makes sure everything works for you perfectly. Johny will be attentive to every detail. Paco will share stories that will keep you engaged.

"Don't stay here if you want to get any sleep! We paid $350 USD for 2 nights in this little jungle hut. The staff didn't tell us that the first night, there was a live band playing DIRECTLY under our room and the music was literally shaking the walls of our hut. That ended at 11pm, and then the regular bar music began after that, which played until approx. 4am.  The 2nd night was worse because the bar didn't close until 6:30am. The restaurant then opens up at 8am for breakfast, and the music gets turned up i"
" All things considered, our room was clean, but it was also right next to the septic tank, so on top of not being able to sleep due to a busy bar blasting music until the early morning, we were also constantly dealing with sewage smells wafting into our room.   Not a pleasant experience, and for that price, we could have stayed in a quiet hotel where the staff actually care how your stay goes.   Would not recommend this place to anyone over the age of 20 years old, as this is clearly only a viable option fo"

Hotel was appropriate for jungle setting. Staff made it nice because they were so nice and very helpful. The food was very good and inexpensive in their affiliated restaurant. Tulum was interesting and I liked dining in the trees on the beach.
"Aldea Tulum is a beautiful boutique hotel, right across the road from the beaches of Tulum. The rooms are exactly as pictured, with a beautiful canopy bed and a balcony and wood touches that complement the location. Our one piece of feedback was that in our room the floors were not perfectly clean when we arrived (but again, it is a treehouse in a jungle). What really made our stay incredible was the hospitality. They bring you breakfast to your room, to your bed if you want or to your balcony. Mayumi was o"
"This room was exactly what we expected. Although there isn't A/C, which is the norm for places in Tulum, there was a circulating fan within the mosquito netting around the bed so there was a constant, lovely breeze. We stayed in #4, and the music from Ice Cream Bar and Casa Jaguar wasn't as loud as we were expecting based on other reviews."
I was referred to this place by a friend but was skeptical because of the reviews!   Very happy choosing Aldea Tulum. We stayed 8 days. Our room was amazing on the second floor with a big patio and bottled water replaced everyday. Downstairs at the front desk was friendly staff that was knowledgable about the area for any questions or inquiries you might have. Good wifi. Warm environment to stay in.  Right outside the hotel was I Scream Bar that offered cheap eats and drinks wand a great nightlife spot for 
 Should you choose to leave to go into town you can rent bikes for the day and take a 30 minute ride up the street to reach public beaches and ruins.  We booked through Expedia so there were two separate payments we made before arrival. No hidden fees as some others have said.
…
"The accomodation was really nice and special, everything was clean.   Access to the sea was good. Beach and beach clubs were very nice. Parking was offered for 200 Pesos per day.  Ice-Scream bar nearby and some sort of generator caused ongoing noise during the night, but was ok for me.  The breakfast as per attached picture was really poor. As there was no buffet, you had to ask for third slice of bread or a second cup of coffee."
Hôtel appartement neuf avec quelques finitions restantes autour de la piscine. Parking devant l'hôtel.  Gardien H24 Très bon accueil Propre et très spacieux. Très bonne literie.  Manquait des ceintres dans la penderie et une cafetière ou bouilloire. A l'entrée de Tulum mais très proche du centre à pied. Je vous recommande cet appartement. Très bon rapport qualité prix.
"just tried the restaurant, beautifull place and good food  BUT carefull about waiters... we had scam on the bill about the tips  the waiter  asked us cash tips then he put also 20% tips on the credit card  and didn't gave us the card reciepe and also pretended to forget to give us our credit card back  so he had 40% tips we didn't pay attention to that because it's a high standard place.....  but we had the surprise on the bank account later...."
"We had an excellent 4 night stay at the Bejuco Hotel.  The location is fantastic and spending a lazy afternoon in one of the teepee huts or hammocks is sublime.

Our room was plenty adequate for 2 adults and a nine year old girl...and you are probably going to want to spend all of your time outside anyway.

"Decent and super simple rooms with great AC and good wifi. Really affordable if you’re just looking for a spot to sleep while venturing into Tulum. Came here for a few nights for the New Year because I was stuck and needed a place to stay ASAP!   Found this little spot and went to check it out. Quite far down the strip so I would recommend renting a bike from a nearby hotel to get around (trust me, it’s worth it). You can lock it on the stairs inside. Or else, rent a car to get around the zone and into Cent"
"We were extremely disappointed with our stay here. Beware as some of the best reviews here are for the restaurant, not for the hotel. We booked and prepaid a cabin for six nights at 220$ each and felt like we wasted a big part of our travel budget on this overpriced place. Just for the sake of comparison: You can get a spacious nice room in tulum city and a rental car for less than 100$ per night. Nothing about this hotel is thought through. The cabins are squeezed in between a noisy street and the entrance"
Overpriced. Smelly old and small. This is not a hotel. There is no reception nothing. No one to give you any information. We arrived before check in hours. There was no such urgency or anything to make sure we get our room early. I understand hotels have check in hours but most hotels would try to accommodate you as soon as they can. There is no such thing as hospitality at all in this place. Nowhere to put you bags. The guy who runs the “hotel” came later than 3pm and start check us in. Asked me for y cred
 stay here this is an overpriced place. There are better boutique hotels around with so much to offer. Check reviews always before you book anything. That was my mistake but lesson learned from now on. Don’t let pictures deceive you. I put a picture of the room I don’t have pictures of the horrible bathroom. It’s makes noise at night the sink and the shower has no place to put your shampoo or anything. Very uncomfortable. It didn’t have outlets either. It was so bad!  
…
"We stayed in the hotel for two nights and we were really disappointed.   The room was old, really small, loud (directly at the street with bad windows so therefore we didn't find a lot of sleep). In addition the bathroom had only about 2 m2 and taller people have some problems to sit on the toilet...there was also a terrible chemical smell in it.   The only positive thing is the restaurant...the location is well decorated and the food for dinner is really good. Unfortunately the breakfast was not the same s"
OMG !! it was so fun and the food was absolutely awesome.  We made a reservation for a tiki hut looking at the ocean it was perfect.  After dinner we hung out in the hammocks.  What a unique experience.  Worth it.
"They overcharged us by $400 to $500 and do not respond to our request for details: Bejuco was our last accommodation on our Tulum adventure so we wanted to end in style. We splurged on the ""Master Suite Ocean Front"" which was no suite at all. I guess by suite they meant we got a door-less bathroom (no fridge) and by ocean front they meant that we had a views of water from our patio directly above the bar. The name of the room was misleading but even more so was the costs. Our booking was for $1775 USD for 3"
" they double charged us for some of the meals we had, which were good but ridiculously overpriced (go to El Asadero for way better food at a fraction of the price).  We traveled at the beginning of February and at time of writing this review it is March 13th and 6 emails later. They refuse to provide us with the details of the charges. Even if the highest exchange rate was used through February, we should still not have been over $2,600 which, by the way, is far too much for their misleading ""Master Suite""."
Okay so the hotel itself looks really nice and had great reviews. But my boyfriend and I booked this place and it was horrible. The walls are so thin I heard the people in the room next to me cough as if they were in my room. The ceiling creeks everytime someone takes a step. Also the rooms are SO SMALL. The room with twin beds is as small as a closet. With the size and noise I could not fall asleep. I awoke to the sound of cleaning people brooming outside my door at 7 am.   I asked to cancel after one nigh
 giving a refund when your patrons can't even sleep is ridiculous. Would not recommend.

"I warn anyone trying to book this hotel. There is a reason why the prices are lower here than elsewhere. Even if you get confirmed your room, you might not get it. I double checked with them before coming to tulum after reading reviews of other peoples bad luck. Even when i got a written confirmation from the management i still got scammed out of my room and my refund.  The management is doing business out of peoples bookings. This is not a one-off case. This happened to me and the person checking in just b"

"Save yourself the headache and book elsewhere. We made a reservation through a third-party but paid at the hotel when we arrived at check-in. After check-in, we discovered that the villa did not have a back door that locked. The keypad to the front door was also not working, so only way in and out of the villa  was through the back door (that did not lock) or through a front window (that also did not lock). The hotel claimed that they had no other rooms available. Later they claimed that even if they had an"
" the refund they owed me. No one ever picked up the phone and no one ever responded to my emails. I was eventually refunded by the third-party company that I booked the reservation through. Had I not used a third party, I never would have gotten refunded. Even though the price of this hotel is half the price of others in the area, I still would not recommend staying here, unless you don't mind shady and unscrupulous business practices or gambling with your safety."

"We booked this hotel because in the pictures it looked so lovely, new, clean and the view from the hand was a most!! Unfortunately we arrived and the “hand” was not accessible for us because of renovations, the room was not very well cleaned, the closet didn’t have hangers, I asked for them, I’v never got them, we didn’t have a bath mat in our first day, the pool was not clean, the shower at the pool didn’t worked... For the price we payed we expected a better service. The only thing we liked was the staff."
"We originally rented a lovely VRBO property on the bay for our family beach vacation to celebrate our son’s 30th birthday. Little did we know that we’d be greeted there by the horrific stench from the rotting piles of seaweed all along the bay and the road to the house. We immediately started searching for new accommodations in Tulum and stumbled upon this unique and lovely hotel. The service could not have been better.

" the hotel. The groundskeepers and security officials at the parking lot were all so kind and helpful. Each and every one made us feel welcome. The hotel itself is lovely. We loved the room designs and decor. The 2-story rooms with sleeping lofts have beautiful views of the grounds and jungle and offer guests lots of space to relax and socialize. The swimming pool is an added bonus, as is the Hun high above the jungle. The location is outstanding. We could walk in either direction and find delicious restaur"
"DON’T SEND CASH!!! This place will take it and run.  After numerous attempts to receive our deposit back, we have been ignored and left on read and now blocked on Instagram.  We have a written contract stating that our deposit is fully refundable due to COVID restrictions, and they don’t want to honour it. Even though they made the contract.  They originally fought us in November and said that our reasoning wasn’t enough, to end the conversation saying that “it’s too far away contact us closer to”… to only "

"We had such a wonder stay here and wish we could have stayed longer! The rooms are lovely with special touches to provide comfort and functionality. We had 2 kids with us and the hotel suited us perfectly! The common area for drinks in the evening with the open air is amazing and breakfast was superb! Yogurt and granola to start, coffee and juice then a full main course- omelet, or hot cakes or a traditional option were our choices (SO GOOD!!). This made for a perfect start to the day.

"I stayed in the most basic cabanas for six days and it was great. But be prepared, you are not in one of the big Hotels of Cancun. So there's no luxury at all.  For me that included shared bathrooms and showers. One advice for the showers, if you take one in the afternoon, the water is warmer. Also the service is friendly and not fast. I you are on a rush, don't go to this place.  But if you want to relax, be very close to the beach, and a 15 minutes walks to the Tulum ruins, this is the place.  Also, the s"
"This place actually exceeded my expectations for the cabanas. I was expecting a camping like experience near the beach. We were rarely in the cabanas except to sleep, but we got restful sleep. The beds were pretty cozy, but they only have sheets, no blankets. Because of this I would bring some warm pajamas in case the nights are cold. We did have a couple cold nights and had some warmer things to wear. Most of the time though it was not needed.  The cabana was clean when we got to it, there was soap, shampo"
" the beach is great and I loved it. I would recommend a few nights in the cabanas, we stayed 5 and I feel that was too long as we really liked a normal shower. There is also the super touristy area about a 15 minute walk from the hotel. This makes getting cash and supplies really easy. This is also where the ruins are.  When I booked we weren't sure about security, but they have locks etc on the doors and this exceeded my expectations. The cabana was also cleaner than I had expected.  Not having wifi in the"
…
"Poor service, (shockingly) poor cabanas, poor amenities, but amazing location! We were somewhat deceived by the photos - our cabana was literally just a bed- it didn't even have curtains so people walking by could see in. No fan either and the front desk said they were ""out"" of fans. Womens showers were cold and the lights weren't working? We left after one night and are not high maintenance people."
Fabulous robinson Crusoe like place. Loved it. Peaceful sanctuary just what I needed. Basic cabana stones throw from beautiful peaceful beach where i practiced hug A every morning. Staff were friendly and helpful. Loved the simplicity of the place. It does however need to.offer refillable water as only option for drinking water is buy small 20 peso plastic bottles of it - not enviro friendly.
Lovely place which  has amazing beach access to a dream beach .It is rustic but heavenly.It could be improved by a few tiny measures.Lights in shower blocks need improving .At least some hooks on walls to hang towels/swimsuits.A small brush in each cabana for sand .
The hotel has a very good location (close to Tulum) but The rooms are not  clean and the absence of air con and swimming pool is really painful. I thought the price was too high for the service. No drinking water available!!!! That does not fit with the price!
"Sorry to say, but this place is not worth the money. We stayed in a small cabana with a bed that was to small for two people to sleep in. The bed was also to short. We’re not tall people but the feet were almost out of the bed.   The house was very small with no place to sit and just one fan that hardly worked.  Only one power outlet where the fan had to be and that was a problem because you have no electricity during daytime, so the only time you can charge your phone or computer is during night time. Okay"
" if you had wet feet and I fell and got hurt badly in my back. When I told the man in the reception that when we checked out, he didn’t offer me any compensation.   The service in the restaurant was okay and so was the food. The beach is nice, but unfortunately there were algae in the water, so we could not swim.   One more thing that was good was that we had walking distance to the Maya ruins.   This was not a good start on our vacation in Mexico, but fortunately we found a much better place to stay where "
"We’ve visited La Launa for 1 day every year since 2012 during our  Rivera Maya vacation.  It is always a highlight of our trip.  The beach and service are unsurpassed.  Unfortunately, the lunch menu is now focused on Italian food vice seafood.  While the food this year was OK, it really was much better in years past. We miss the superb shrimp cocktail and fish tacos.  That being said, if you are visiting for the beach then La Luna is a great choice for a day trip from Playa del Carmen."
"I stayed here for the past two days. The rooms were clean and spacious, I stayed in a king bed  on the first floor and there were attachments for a hammock. The room is exactly what I was expecting and paid for, nothing fancy but very quaint. If you rather, you can bring your own pillow sheet. The hot water works, just use the right knobs (marked F). The best part was the location, very near to a great restaurant called El Asador (try the arrechera) and plenty of street food carts at nighttime. Make sure to"
" hotel seeing as the price was fair and you get a private room as opposed to the Hostel next door (Hostel Shek). Tons of tourists in this part of town and close to all bars and restaurants. The owner and his family (Andrea) live there, he is very hospitable and have good advice. I even showed up late for check-in (bus delayed) and although they were asleep they let me in.

"With travelled through Mexico all the way down to Belize, had Cabañas with only a bed in it and power from 7pm to 7am, but this place was by far the worst!   While the owner is interested in your money but nothing else, mirrors exactly the look of the room. Shaby, mold on the walls and the bath fittings, no hot water even after mentioning it to the owner, a bed that is less comfortable then sleeping on a stone with needles on it. If you try to sleep forget it, you won't, the main street is right next to you"
"My brother and I spent 3 nights at La Luna Gitana winter 2016. The location to town is among the best. Can walk a minute and be at the main road where you'll find everything! The owners are some of the nicest people I've met among my travels. We fell into some trouble and they went above and beyond to help us sort out the issues, including driving us around in their own vehicle and making phone calls on our behalf, (poor spanish). The place isn't 5 star beautiful but it is nice and very comfortable, theres "
"For a budget hotel, we were quite happy with this place. We were in Tulum for a week and stayed here the whole time. The room was spacious and clean. The couple that owned it were super friendly and helpful as well. It is right in town, yet far enough from the bustle of the main street that it was quiet. The only thing lacking was the ability to lock the windows, albeit there was a gate that closed at night. "
"We stayed there in jan 16 and wanted to book online to avoid struggling finding a place. There wasn't many hotels available online in our price range so booked that one at 750 pesos. This isn't very cheap in Mexico (for budget places) and we heard people coming in and the price was halved, without even negociating... Which was a bit upsetting. Other than that, the place is nice and clean. The family lives there so you often hear the mother screaming after her kids. They don't offer bikes which is a shame as"

"Go to Tulum, stay in town. Make that your base, great people, restaurants and nightlife. Authentic and amazing people. Minutes from the beach or hang out in a cenote in the jungle for the day. I Love it! We stayed at Hotel La Luna Gitana for our 2 weeks, right off the main strip, next to a hostel. It was a super great deal, comfortable, clean, and safe.

Make sure you wear bug spray of light long sleeve shirt and pants because of the bugs. The temazcal was everything i expected and more!!! I got so emotional and I wasn't expecting that at all. It was such an intense, healing and spiritual ritual! I came out... different in the best way!   I'm definitely coming back and doing it again. If"

The room was nice and comfortable and the air conditioner worked very well (very important to have in tulum with the heat and humidity) breakfast was excelent (omlettes, toast and fruits) all made to order. Parking is small but available. Location is perfect. The staff treated us very well and I give a special thanks to Sergio fo"

Comfortable bed and a perfect view  The hotel also has 2 amazing pools and restaurant with tasty Indian dishes.  We Will come again for sure Thank you for an amazing experience And a great time  Adi & Shachar"
 recommend this hotel to anyone. It is located far from the loud music of the bars which made it nicer to sleep. But it is with in walking distance to most places in the tulum beach strip. 
"Mayur is a place I can’t even describe in words, but I will try- my experience there was once in a lifetime. From the rooms, the food, the amenities, the pool, the Temezcal, the environment- everything exceeded my expectations!!! I love the rawness of the jungle and how healing it is. We had massages in the Treehouse that were so relaxing! I will be coming back for many years to come! Raj and his staff were super respectful and accommodating!"

"I had an amazing stay at Nativa Hotel. The young lady at the front desk was extremely helpful with anything I needed. She helped with recommendations around the area; the beach, restaurants, etc. I loved my room and plunge pool after a day out. The place was extremely quite and peaceful. The included breakfast was yummy and perfect to start my day. The free bikes at the property were great to get around the area. I have no complaints about this hotel. I found them hospitable, accommodating and super nice. "
"There was no receptionist and we waited for 3 hours for a security guard to show up. In the mean time the housekeeping person was alleging that my prepaid reservation was NOT paid and they were trying to charge me for the room AGAIN. To add insult to injury, after having paid for a ""suite"", they put me in the lowest category possible as they had oversold the hotel. Nobody from reception showed up the entire day even though the person was allegedly on their way the entire afternoon. The housekeeping person s"
" hotel is described as eco chic. I see the eco part but NOT the chic. The room is barely basic and there were ants in the bed.  At check out, there was NO discount offered as part of decompensation and they said I would have to ask for it directly from the booking platform. The employee Sergio lied telling the platform they had offered me a free breakfast. The worst experience I have ever had in México which is very surprising since I usually have exceptional service every where. HORRENDOUS!! Please avoid a"

"This hotel and its staff are some of the most genuinely caring and attentive people I have met. Julia was available at any notice for any service and was so accommodating. She acted more as a friend (offering me tips, advice, sending me directions, showing me around the property, even walking me to the beach) than a manager. The service and property were really lovely. The amenities were also plentiful and great quality (wifi, television, air conditioning, private terrace). There are restaurants and pharmac"
"Great price for this hotel, the rooms are clean, especially the sanitary rooms. Wifi and AC are working great and the owner is one of the nicest people you will ever meet while travelling! I checked in very late and was pretty sick. The owner helped me and offered to buy medicine and sparkling water from the supermarket, which helped with my stomach problems. For my whole stay he was very friendly and courteous in all regards. Can greatly recommend this hotel!"
"My partner and I had originally booked a hostel before we arrived in Tulum and we were so appalled that we couldn’t stay. We jumped on booking.com and found this place and I’m so glad we did. Just a short walk away we found ourselves in a great big room with a huge king size bed, great air con, really good wifi connection and the shower had amazing pressure. We were also treated to a small kitchenette. The only down side is that it is a short walk from everything (by short I do mean 5 minutes) but there is "
"Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Staff is friendly, professional and very helpful with advise about local activities, attractions and local restaurants (the street food is the best). Air conditioners and wi-fi work terrific. Will definitely be staying there again on our next trip. Excellent all around value."
"The main issue was a strong chemical smell coming from the bathroom which filled the whole room, even with the bathroom door closed.  It smelt like urinal cubes that had been put into the pipes and was so strong that it made us feel unwell.  We were staying in room 8. The hotel is on the outskirts of Tulum - not really far but not so close that you drop in/out.  In the evenings, the last part of the street was not one I would have felt comfortable with walking on my own - perhaps just perception but I felt "
"The apartment itself was nice but smelled of mold. Horrible service: no sign on the outside, shady neighbourhood, staff = security guard, speaks zero English, dirty pool and loungers (stains and hairs), we woke up at 3am from groups coming home from partying yelling, loud music, a girl who was totally drugged up was knocking on our door asking for help to get her the hell out of this place, she wasn’t even staying at Mudra, our kids were scared and we didn’t sleep the rest of the night because of the noise "
Our gripe from the beginning is that we were charged more than we agreed to for exchange rate. Only about $10 in the end but we won’t be going back if they can’t keep their word. Outside of that this is far from a finished product. They nickel and dime you for water and coffee pods. There aren’t enough clean towels (they told us to use the same one for the room and pool). There was some trash in the room at check-in including fake eyelashes from a previous guest. The pads on the pool chairs are stored at 4-
 area is a hotel 3 blocks away. I’ll stay there next time.

"While the design is nice (Bali type), the hotel has some enormous flaws that make the stay very disappointing. First, the 2 bedrooms of our apartment didn’t have masking blinds which makes it difficult to sleep after sunrise around 7am (and the hotel claims that no picture showed the blinds, but have you ever seen hotel pictures of rooms with the blinds closed ?!) Second, the wifi was unstable and slow (even for Gmail page loading) Third, the running water was salty...  So in conclusion, it is unacceptable "
PH1 was beautiful! Very Clean and great views. The staff was so friendly and helpful with everything we needed. They really went above and beyond! The location was close to everything we wanted to do and see :)
I was very stressed looking for the right hotel. Rosy blew me away and was amazing. She made everything easy and the hotel was beautiful! I  Highly recommend!!! Thank you again MUDRA and of course Rosy!
"I stayed here with a large group that had two different rooms and on the last day we noticed a few electronic items from both rooms were missing. We alerted the front desk immediately and nothing ever came from that - we did not receive a refund or discount for our stay which is so poor. In addition, we made sure to lock our doors every day but every time we came back, our slider door was unlocked. This is completely unacceptable."
"We had a great stay that exceeded expectations. Mudra is stylish, restful, clean, with a charming pool. Location in La Velata area is great - coffee on the corner, yoga, close to main road, grocery, etc. But as others have noted - Mudra really shines with its service. The entire team is amaze - but the star is Rosy who acts as your personal concierge. Rosy booked bikes, restaurants, found cars when there were none avail and was also just an awesome pleasure. Thank you Rosy for making our trip wonderful. Eve"

My sisters and I go to a different resort every year. Our sole purpose is to lay on the beach, and indulge in good food. When we got there, we went down to the beach and were horrified!

" seriously. They were supposed to contact us the following day after we spoke to our travel agent. Didn’t happen.   This resort definitely caters to the “special” members, and being a non-member, we were denied several amenities. The tiny area we found on the beach, at the far end, had places that we could camp with an umbrella, but for the rest of the beach, only members got covered spaces. Also, we could not have access to all the pools because we’re not “special”. Plus, members could get reservations dur"

"Went to this resort in February with 3 other couples and had the most amazing time.  The property is HUGE and has some many different pools, hammocks, beach getaways, restaurants, etc.  I never felt trapped and the restaurant options made each day feel a little different.  The restaurant by the beach felt like an island vacation.   There were 3 total resorts and you could walk down a beach path to all of them.  It was really great to have the different options.  The property is absolutely beautiful and well"
"I recently stayed at El Dorado with family and a friend, the resort is gorgeous, well maintained and the staff very attentive.  We had a fabulous time, but had a few frustrating moments during our stay. The right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing. We booked Bali beds( bed reserved for extra $ by the pool), but when we went to locate our bed and start using, a staff said we didn’t have it reserved, This was extremely frustrating because our concierge booked the Bali bed and said it was taken care"
" better the resort would be that much better. When you have to be unnecessarily bothered for silly things on vacation it takes away from the experience. Also, things like spending 10 minutes picking out types of pillows and essential oil scents and then never received the pillows. Check out is very time consuming, so make sure you give yourself plenty of time to check out and look over bill. There are definitely hidden charges if you are not careful.  The staff was very kind and worked hard at making our ex"

"The only thing 5 star are the staff, the rooms in my view are basic, waited four days for my fridge to be restocked. When I say not a beach holiday, two thirds of the beach you have to pay extra and this could be as much as $160 a day, the other third looks like a WW2 landing beach as it's covered in large concrete blocks. The red flag was out for the duration of our holiday so a swim in the sea was out. The part of the beach you could use you had to vacate at about 4.00pm as the staff would turn the area i"
" strict dress code, but it's not enforced by the staff. Also at one end of the complex there is an open sewer with human excrement floating on the top. All the photos shown on the web and I'm the tui brochure are NOT as things are. From what I understand this place suffered badly from a storm last year and the place is still recovering and is in the middle of a repair schedule, shame we were not informed at the time of booking."

"no windows in the rooms, no lock on the doors from the inside, very loud dogs from the neighbours which sounds like they are in your room, semi-broken safe deposit box. definitely better choices to stay in tulum...."
"ROBBING IN THE ROOMS - ROBO EN LAS HABITACIONES  One day and another do not rob the guests of both the private rooms and the room with shared beds and THE OWNER of the place responds that it is NORMAL THAT IN A HOSTAL ROBEN, yourselves draw their conclusions.  The KITCHEN of the place to share is an DISGUSTING and the FRIDGE IS LIKE A SPECIES OF DUSTY FOOD WASTE DRAWER and at night they can BE DEVELOPED with the COCKROACHES on top of the dishes and the food they leave lying,"
"Stayed here in December as part of a tour group. I was sharing with one other girl and we got the farthest room, I think room 7.   Room was damp and when I went to take a nap, the bed had a lot of someone else's hair inside and on the pillows. The sheets were visibly dirty in addition to the hair. They changed the sheets when I mentioned but couldnt wait to leave the hotel."
I stayed 2 nights at this dirty and poorly maintained hotel. A friend in our group unfortunately left her cash and credit card locked in the safe in her locked hotel room while she went to the beach. When she got back to her room both cash and card had gone. She checked her account on line and £1500 had already been spent. It had to have been an inside job but the management refused to accept responsibility. Don’t stay here!  
"The rooms are the issue here - slightly musty, wood dust, and poor external ventilation. But GREAT value, and the other features of the property make this place worth staying at. Location - at the edge of town nearest the beach (a 10-15 min bike ride), opposite a huge supermarket, and close enough to restaurants etc. The property has a small  but welcome pool, a friendly bar and some food. The staff are friendly and helpful. The outside garden common area was useful for our small group."
For the price this was good value .Depending on which beach resort you want to go to its 80 to 120 mxn taxi ride .There are some good restaurants nearby but the restaurant on site was very good as were the cocktsils .There is a very small pool which is refreshing . The garden was lovely and there is a shared kitchen area  with a fridge .
"This is the second time that I come and once again absolutely loved it ! The first time was a couple of months ago for a night, the room was charmingly decorated and confortable, perfect to rest. The second time was a week ago at the restaurant only, the food is superior for a average price and a very nice atmosphere. Special thumb up to our waitress Rocio, it was only her second day on the job and she was perfectly able to advice us the right meal acording to our mood and enhance the friendly vibes of the "

"The prices are good, and the grounds are nice. They have great setup, give you lemonade when you arrive. They have Happy hour and beer specials, and also offered us chips and salsa.

All in all it’s a mixed bag."
"Stayed her as part of a group tour. Our Tour Leader had informed them twice of the make up of the group and our expected arrival time but they were not ready for us and did not allocate the rooms appropriately, leaving it to our leader to sort out.

After much research we decided on Tres Palmas and we could not be happier, not only is the price right, but the hotel ambiance, the treatment and even the employees, you feel exactly how you would like to feel at a hotel featuring the best Mexico has to offer- it is clean, affordable, has Mexican charm and al staff greeting buenos dias with a smile.

"Tres Palmas did the job just fine.  It was basic, but very clean and cozy.  The location was the best part for me.  So close to everything you needed - all my fave restaurants and amenities.  It is quiet enough (quiet for Tulum...there will be the sound of howling cats and barking dogs, but there is no escaping that) being off the main strip but close enough to be convenient.  The staff were lovely, hot water worked as did the AC.  Be prepared - regardless of how you book - to use Paypal to pay your bill.  "

"This was absolutely the worst hotel experience we've ever had - DO NOT book here.   We booked Arena Blue for our wedding because they were one of the few hotels that let us do a full buy-out of the hotel and get married on the beach.  Thankfully, we hosted our reception at Gitano (and had a wonderful experience there.)  When we arrived on-site for our wedding, they told us that they had re-booked half of our guests to another hotel which was at the other end of the beach - about 20 minutes away to drive.  N"

"Located a bit out of the way, but that's why it is decently priced. 15 minute walk from ADO bus station & main strip. 20 minute taxi ride from Playa Pairiso. Free breakfast offered is scrambled eggs & toast with coffee & juice. No safe in the room. When we were there, they had freshly painted the room. There were still paint odors from the work, and later, someone came in to spray for bugs. We are easy going so it wasn't a problem, but if you aren't a flexible or easygoing traveller, please consider that th"

As a bride the first day of an exciting but stressful wedding weekend, this was a horrible first impression for us and our guests.  They were terrible to deal with onsite and gave us the runaround on this issue the whole time. They finally agreed that while they would not provide any refunds, they would allow everyone to come b"

"We had a reservation for one night, for myself, my husband and our two small dogs. This was our first visit to Tulum and we had driven a couple of hours after a 4-hour flight. When we arrived we told they only accept pets on request, which we thought we had done. As such we were stranded in an unfamiliar place. Not a good experience although we did ultimately find a place to stay."

"I cant say enough about the staff at Arena Blue, they were so acomidating to anything we needed and very polite and friendly. We moved to another resort after a week because they were full over newyears, which may be a bit fancier but here your just another number and I luved the personal touch at Arena Blue. Thankyou so much for making our stay so special! :-)"
"Located in a residential area, the place is quiet with spacious rooms and  a nice ambiance. However,  since it's away from the center, you will need a cab to go anywhere which can sometimes be inconvenient. There are no restaurants,  shops  or an ATM machine within walking distance. I arrived at night and the young fellow at the desk couldn't  speak a word of English which caused big problems. I  urgently needed  information (for example, where to buy water from or get a meal) and he was, of course, unable "
"We spent 14 days in this beautiful hotel during our spring vacation in Mexico. Good staff, nice rooms, quiet and good sleeping. Tasty breakfast. Nice place to go scuba diving in cenotes, discover Tulum, Mayan ruins (highly recommended to rent a car) and beaches.  Good and cheap restaurants are nearby."
"We had a good stay with them in July 2018, but to our big surprise out of nowhere in June 2019 they charged our credit card $2000, we NEVER booked a stay with them in 2019, they are criminals and rubbing people. We contacted the hotel at least 8 times. they ignored us and then we asked our credit card company to contact them, they even lied to them and said that will return the money within few days, it been 2 months and we still did get our money back. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
"Easy walk from the ADO bus station. Located just one block off the main strip in downtown Tulum, toward the further end of town. I was fine walking that one quiet block with my boyfriend at night, but if you're by yourself or not a comfortable traveler, you might taxi instead. Room was clean and comfortable, ours was spacious too. Breakfast was basic - toast and eggs, coffee and juice - but that's all we needed. AC worked great! TV in the room. No in-room safe. Front gate gets locked at night though so all "
"I THOUGHT I had a nice stay at Arena Blue Tulum with my family last November. When I booked the hotel in September 2018 I was asked to pay a 100% deposit to secure the 2 rooms, which I did. We had a nice stay and paid for our extra meals etc at check-out. End of story. Imagine my surprise when on 15 July 2019 I see that Arena Blue have taken money out of my account - more or less the same amount I paid for the reservation in September 2018.  When I contacted Arena Blue to ask why they had taken money out of"
"I found this place through a guide book's online page. It sounded good. But the review was a little bid misleading about the location of this place. This place in town and location is if you wanna stay in town for a longer stay not on beach is very good.  The rooms are large and clean . However there is not much natural light. But it is nice that you have a big room. The pillows were very hard ,that was not good. but the bed is comfortable. The boy who was working foe thunders were really really nice. I thi"
 100% upfront. They are yet to reply or explain taking this money out of my account despite me and others from my family sending them multiple emails and even calling them. Sadly it looks like we’re going to have to get a lawyer involved. What worries me most is that they still had my card details on file 9 months ater my stay and are yet to confirm that they’ve taken them off their system. It’s a shame that such a nice-seeming hotel should be cover for a scam.

We had a short stay of 3 nights the room was clean and quiet breakfast was just a minimum oaks coffee and a toast but enough the personal always gentle first night a problem with the AC of neighbor soo much noise the next day they fixed it and change our room
"Very simple small hotel, no TV or phones on the rooms. Quiet place right at the beach, comfortable but luxury at all.  Friendly staff. It is pricey for what has to offer. They are very close to and have ocean views, but should bring prices down a bit."
"It has big rooms and a variety of choices in rooms. The beach spot is small but nice. They have a great restaurant and a small but friendly staff. They have keeping you cool while you sleep, figured out! They are focused on ecology but not so much you get cold showers."
"I just came back from Tulum and want to share my HORRIBLE experience with Arena Blue Hotel. I came with a group of 4 other girlfriends, and we rented 3 separate rooms. The Hotel itself is Ok, nothing fancy, but what I really want to share with anyone who would put a thought into choosing this pace – DO NOT!!! BECAUSE THEY ARE THIEVES!!! On the last night of our stay all 3 rooms discovered that Cash Money is missing from Safe Boxes. All 3 safe boxes in all 3 rooms!!! No, it was not left open by us, and it wa"
"Am going to go straight to what any potential guest might know:  - dirty rooms - AC working just for a few hours - NO WIFI neither in the commun areas nor in the rooms - staff not always available - no help from the staff - SUPER BAD QUALITY - EXPENSIVE for the service received  We quit it before our departure date and booked another hotel, and we lost 350euros which they reject to reimbourse at all.  Dont go!"
"The location of the hotel is great, right on the beach.  This is a ""no frills"" hotel with all the basics but nothing more.  The room was clean but we had trouble with the air conditioning. Luckily they had another room available and we were able to switch.  The restaurant/ bar  had very poor service and was extremely overpriced for what it was."
"Facilities are nice and simple cabanas with great  helpful Staff, great beach and beyond great restaurant, our waiter was very attentive, the food and drinks were very good,  The sea food and fish were fantastic. We would highly recommend this place and will return."
We strongly advise not staying here. The rooms weren't great but the worst thing is that all our money was stolen from our room. There was no forced entry and a safety deposit box was not offered to us on arrival. Even worse was that on trying to report the theft to the reception staff their attitude was uncaring and even obstructive. The manager refused to come and speak to us staying that they were too busy and the reception refused to call the police telling us to wait on the road until the police came p

I cannot express enough how enjoyble our stay was at Luu's place on the beach! This is how Tulum should stay but it is growing too fast. Only the rich will be able to enjoy it before long but I was lucky enough to get to visit this little slice of heaven before it is gone. No there isn't any AC but the ocean breeze kept us nice and cool in JUNE! It was a great open air experience listening to the ocean all day and night. Talk about relaxing... We were directly on the beach with our own private piece of Tulu

"We just spent the day at the OM beach club.  We had originally planned to go somewhere else but did not like the vibe.  This beach club was great, our waiter was very attentive, the food and drinks were very good, and when a downpour came and everyone went into the restaurant, the manager/owner (not sure which) was very attentive to everyone and very friendly.  The pizza was fantastic.  We would highly recommend this place and will return."
" which was important because I had over $10k in camera equipment with me. We stayed in the second story single bed loft type of room and it was wonderful. Luu's place is centered around many good places to eat and drink. It was an adventure we will never forget. The staff didn't speak English but we were able to communicate well enough for our needs. Our room was cleaned every day. I would stay here again in a minute.  What more can I say, it is just a beautiful space to enjoy the beach environment."
"I've been going to Om Tulum for many years to enjoy at a day at the beach. I read the reviews before heading there this year. I was surprised at all the terrible comments but I decided I'd go regardless since I was going for the beach beds and drinks. I also had some friends from London that were staying there and to my surprise they were pleased with their room and the price they paid for it. As for me, the drinks were good, well priced and the service was quick and the waiters were all very polite and too"

The owners are really nice people and the beach huts are great as you get your own private hut with fly nets over the beds which are needed in Tulum. Complimentary breakfast of waffles banana and coffee was great too. Would definitely stay here again if we visit Tulum again!
"I stayed in Lu's house in Tulum and it was amazing, the location is perfect for Tulum, you are in the center of the beach so you can get to the restaurants either south or north super easily. The staff is amazing on the property, I never saw them but when I needed anything, they seemed to magically appear.  The property is perfectly clean, super spacious, comfortable. I highly highly recommend this spot. The kite surfing is out your front door and the coolest hippest bar a couple of doors down. You can sit "
You feel very welcome. We just spoke English and one on the owner only spoke Italien and Spanish we still had a lot of conversation and he tried the best he could to help us and to answer any questions. The dogs was amazing and I loved the fact that is was raining mangos. 
"I came across this hotel by sheer fluke having met the owners son on a night out. The location is literally a five / ten minute walk to the centre of Tulum which has all the bars, clubs and shops you could need. Therefore ideally located. The facilities are a little basic but for the price I paid I simply could not grumble at all.  The hosts and staff are the main factor here. They are so very welcoming, inviting me to their thanks giving and overall making me feel as if I was part of their family. I’ve rea"

This was our first trip to Tulum, didn't really know what to expect and couldn't have landed in a more perfect spot.  The rooms were spacious, and comfortable and had fans that kept us plenty cool at night.  When there was an issue with the hot water, a team was swiftly deployed to come fix the problem.  Our maids came every day and were lovely!  The beach access is outstanding, with both a private deck near the house w"

Staff: always present until late, which is useful if you need anything.   Location: Not too much of a walk to the city + they rent bicycles.   Minus: Room: we had a cabana, the bed hardly "

If you are backpacking or just need a place to stay and socialize without needing comfort, it's great.  Beds are really small for 2, keep that in mind for longer stays - or you might hate your partner in the morning for having to sleep all night half way out of the bed! If you like your sleep, comfor"

"I rented Luu's private villa for my 40th in October. I've been to tulum 8 visits and this wasn't far the loveliest accommodation I've had. Thoughtful decorations, huge rooms, a communal dining table and full kitchen. Maid came everyday. The most special part though was the beautiful back deck on your private little section of beach. Really a slice of heaven. There was private parking for our rental car. All of my favorite restaurants and cafes are a quick walk down the beach (no shoes necessary) If you're t"

"We stayed two nights (prepaided) and would have left earlier. No electricity or water in the rooms and our roommates were crabs and cockroaches. The receptionist didnt understand any english and didnt provide any service. No meals, drinks or snacks were avaiable and it was not allowed to bring your own...???? Overly priced - seemed abandonded. "
"We stayed 3 nights in here and in general we liked it. The wifi, the breakfast, friendly staff, location to Ado busses were good points. Our only complaint was the quietness of the hostel. Its right on the highway so be ware if that is something bothers you. And this is what they cant influence but there were chickens and roosters making noises starting from 3am. Literally we felt them next to our beds."
"The breakfast at the hotel is amazing, and the staff was really caring and friendly. They even prepared the food earlier in the morning for me and my girlfriend, as we were attending a language school. The hotel area itself is also quite beautiful. However, the rooms/huts are very small with little space for clothes. Further, it's a hut where a lot of mosquitos can get in. During our time there, it was raining a lot and our clothes were wet all the time, with no possibilty to dry. In addition, bathrooms wer"

Negative review are spot on. The owner is a flat out liar and tried to get extra money from the group claiming we needed to make an extra security deposit (bless our organizer who somehow found a way to deal with her). She shhh'd us at 8 am when we stood outside talking in normal voices, saying there were people sleeping in the cabana n"

"Almost no water flow. Receptionist could not find a toilet that worked. Man at desk held us up for 750 pesos for a crud room, then only returned 730 when we refused to stay there. In my opinion this is not a habitable place to stay."
I think we were the only people staying at the hotel. Didn't see any other guests there our whole stay. Staff were trying to rip us off buying water and ice cream so we decided to go across the road and got it for half the price. Restaurant didn't look like it was functioning. Pool definitely wasn't functioning but would be awesome if it was finished. It's huge! No water for showers which was a huge bummer. They seemed to try and fix it but it didn't happen. Had to sit in the lobby for wifi. There was a nic

"Its hard to find anything good to say about the place except the sheets were clean and the air conditioning worked. The location is good but the rest is dire.  The room was full of small red ants, the price was too high for the quality and the man at reception is terribly unhelpful and unfriendly and sleeps in the foyer at night. The food was grim we only ate there once despite having paid for three meals.  The pool water was brown and the whole place filled with building materials and rubble.  All very dis"
"The hotel's location is ideal, as it's located at the entrance to Tulum's Archeological Zone. The rooms were very clean, the air conditioning and Wi-Fi worked, but if you want to charge your devices or computer up, bring your own adaptors; all the outlets that worked were the old two-slotted ones with no ground. The three-prong outlets had no power, and the hotel couldn't resolve it. There was always hot water with good pressure. The pool they advertise is filled with scaffolding, as a matter of fact, when "

There was a young woman and a young man who were as helpful as they could be, and were splendid; but the (perhaps) owner and an older employee of trust showed they knew nothing of customer service or of the hotel-restaurant business. For example, I reserved our room beforehand. The hotel management was supposed to follow up with payment information. They never did, so I called the morning that we were due to arrive. Not only had the owner "

My boyfriend and I were excited to see this hotel as it was ranked in our travel guide as a good budget friendly option. We went into the reception area and asked if we could see a room before paying. Simple request I think.The man at the desk didn't even look up at us and just pointed to a poster at the front door with photos of the outside of the hotel and a room. I asked again in disbelief if we could see a room and he flipped us the middle finger. WOW. DON'T SUPPORT THIS PLACE.
"I’m not generally motivated to write reviews without some sense of reason. My stay a few nights ago at Hotel Acuario, Tulum Mexico was so disappointing, I feel quite motivated to alert others. I’ve been driving across Mexico for days (Guadalajara to Cozumel), and was in need of a decent shower and some sleep. Read about the hotel just across the street in a travel quide and stopped in to check their rooms.  What I was shown was clean and simple and quite resonably priced at 400 pecos (about $30).

It's a great location (1 street back from Main Street, couple of blocks from Protec) the rooms are very basic (no fridge, sketchy wifi, no wardrobe) but they are clean, decent AC and good bathroom. Staff are friendly although limited English spoken so be ready with your best Spanglish if you aren't fluent!   I'd think of it as a motel or hostel more than a hotel. Breakfast is simple - you have two options eggs and chorizo or eggs and ham. But you are so close"
"Good location, about one block from the main street, with lots of restaurants and local taco stands. Basic breakfast included was eggs, toast, coffee and juice. Room was a little worn and dated, especially for the price."
"If you're away from your room being an active tourist, this place is for you. No frills, great AC, nice flat screen TV and hot water. Spanish-speaking only front desk staff but friendly and helpful (140 lbs of dive gear up to the third floor). I'd stay here again if there was a small refrigerator in the room. It was close to where I needed to be for diving."
"This is a good hotel and close to the dive centre and rooms are basic but very clean and tidy so this was great for me. There is a large courtyard area and wifi, although it comes and goes. The breakfast next door was basic but good. Down sides: only one safety box in reception, lots of noise with drills going on until 2200 but that seemed to stop when I complained but as I say if your primary goal is diving and not staying in a fancy place, this is ideal"
"We stayed here for a week during a dive trip.  The hotel's location was great.  It was several blocks from our dive shop and a 2 to 10 minute walk from most of the restaurants we visited (except a few on the beach and I would not recommend going to the beach to eat).  While this is not a hotel that I would take my wife, it was perfect for my dive buddy and me.  Rooms were small, the mattresses were hard but the rooms were very clean and the maids did a good job tidying up the room each day.  For a dive trip"

"I stayed here while diving in Tulum. I chose one of the king-rooms upstairs, since the first floor only has windows to patio. Second floor room was wonderful which a plenty of light and a little balcony. It was clean and comfortable too. I enjoyed being able to open the windows to both directions for fresh breeze.  The service was friendly, wifi worked in the lobby and there was complimentary drinking water and bicykles for rent, too.  Good value for the walk-in price."
"My wife stayed at this hotel in 2/1/14 ., the hotel is close to everything but that is the only good thing about this hotel., the mattresses are too old  and the sheets smells too bad , the noise from the street and from the bars is also very bad I do not recommend this hotel for a couple maybe for a single person who wants to party all night long."
"Convenient, clean, comfortable, and courteous.   The courtyard setting welcomes the traveler.  Staff readily shares knowledge of the area in multiple languages and finds ways to individualize suggestions tapered to the tourist.  Staff also extended themselves beyond expectations.  Gratitude for this beautiful oasis."
"top service from the staff, provided us with deatiled information about the city and attractions. Very Beautiful and clean room decorated with lots of love. Safe and mosquito net at the windows. Highly recommend a stay at Secret Garden Hotel!"
I had the most wonderful experience here! It’s magical! Very unexpected as you walk in off the dusty roads - a little gem awaits you! Matias was really helpful The breakfast was grand - the coffee is ace!the atmosphere is great-the safety factor is tops and the whole experience is fabulous ! And it’s close to everything- I’ll return!!
"Incredibly beautiful, great service from the staff, especially Jorge. Perfect little oasis at a very reasonable price. I think at this level of hotel the breakfast should probably be complemented with fruit, but it’s a small gripe, it includes only bread, jam, cereal, orange juice, milk & coffee . I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
"The room was clean and nice, decorated with love, just few blocks from the mainstreet and 20 mins cycling to the archealogical zone of Tulum. Jorge was a very helpful and friendly host. We will recommend this place to all our friends."
"This is a little budget friendly gem in centro. It is scaled down to the basics but it makes up with ambiance. The garden shared space has packed in many Instagram worthy pic moments (think green vines, bikes, Buddhas, swings and hammocks). The staff was more than accommodating providing recommendations for food, beach and transportation."
"We stayed for three nights and really enjoyed the Secret Garden. Once you enter the gate the ambience is like a little oasis. It was quiet and peaceful, the other guests we met were friendly. There was no wifi while we were there but Matias was a wealth of information and also directed us to the sister hotel to use the wifi there. It was only a 2 min walk to the main street, try the taco restaurant on the corner, it’s great. We would definitely stay there again."
"We enjoyed our stay at secret garden hotel. The front office team is very kind and helpful and the location is quiet and very close to Tulum's city center. The room was confortable, but I would suggest to put more hooks and shelves especially in the bathroom, to help the guests to keep their stuff in order. Recommended!"

The location and architecture of the hotel is so unique and beautiful.  The people working are so kind and had a high quality service, I felt so comfortable reaching out to any of the staff members. Food is incredibly unique and was very happy had a detail explication of how it is prepared. The mezcalitos were my favorite drinks ever. The best ones I have ever tried. Overall"

Very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to navigating us around Tulum. They have bikes and motor scooters available to rent for the day, and a beautiful roof top! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star was for two things, the bathroom had a bit of a smell randomly and there was no iron. Other than that I loved every moment being there!"

The room was so beautiful, the breakfast was made from scratch every morning. Being in a place you have never been can be scary but when you walk in to nothing but smiles and courtesy every day it’s amazing.  The view from the rooftop was the best.  I was there for my sister in law and friends birthday and they put together fresh flowers and more all personalized.  "

Also, I am a solo traveler and in this place you will be able to meet with a lot of people around the world and they will be friends for the rest of your life."
"This place is located in the jungle around one hour by car from Tulum and even though it’s a bit far from the main road (which is also a huge plus) it’s quite easy to find it coming from Francisco which is a little town located just next to the Tulum-Cabo highway. The place is isolated and surrounded by amazing nature which was super important to me after spending few weeks in Tulum that can get a bit exhausting after some time.

There’s tons of showers which makes things convenient. I really enjoyed my stay here, however brief. I was so blown away by the hospitality of Manuel, that I try to visit as often as possible. Only reason I left was I had booked an Air Bnb in advance. Would’ve loved to stay longer."
" nice surprise to find a bottle of sparkling wine waiting in our room after our wedding! I would be happy to stay here again, perhaps for anniversary trip :)"
…
"Great place and mostly great staff, perfect for backpackers! Clean bed, amazing breakfast and very good location, nice bar on the rooftop. Not far from the collectivo who brings you to the beach.  All staff members have been super helpful and warmly welcoming. I would definitely go back."
"Friendly and easy going staff, good central location, artistic design, and nice open spaces for socializing. Good atmosphere with some animal friends to brighten up the day. The showers are warm and there is decent sized space for locking valuables."
"We are so grateful to the staff at Casa Altamar and especially Javier, Erik and Arturo, for matching the beautiful setting with first-class service. My husband and I left Casa Altamar feeling nurtured by the delicious food and drink on the terrace, the simple comfortable rooms, poolside massages, rooftop area for star gazing, and kayaks for cruising around. Casa Altamar is also just a 5 minute walk to a cenote where we did some snorkeling and you can take a taxi to the Tulum Ruins for around $20USD. I'd als"
" fireplace :) you can feel that you are surrounded by the nature in its purest form and it’s super nice to fall asleep listening to the “noises” the crickets make (it doesn’t bother me at all even though I’m a light sleeper). There are avocado and banana trees, oranges, mandarines. The owner also has bees so you can try extremely good locally made honey.   There is a path coming from this place throughout the jungle all the way to highway so you can have a pretty nice walk. The owner of the place is super i"

"I was planning on visiting this hostel for two nights but ended up staying almost two weeks! I used it as a base of operations for day trips. The location makes it perfect for this.  The staff was the BEST! The cleaning staff came every day and kept everything super clean. There were security guards on-site 24/7. Mario and Hector [the main staffers] were always present. They were friendly, helpful, and fun to be around. We played cards, foozeball, had movie nights, cooked and ate together.   The entire atmo"
"What a cool place. We stayed in Room 204, ocean front second floor with balcony and beautiful view of the ocean and sunrise. The room was spacious and staying under a palapa was a cool experience. The staff of course is the best as it’s associated with Panamera. We like to call out David, Fabenny, Jesus, Alberto as they all provided service to us. Our favorite lunch was the fish tacos and green salad. The event staff was fabulous with special events like Paella meal, Sangria and Mezcal tasting. We would rec"
"Absolutely wonderful! My wife and I stayed here in May 2022 and it could not have been nicer. The room was private and perfect down to every detail, especially the cleverly designed shower. And the food was absolutely superb. We will dream about those meals for years. The cenote was an excellent place to swim in crystal clear water with fish and hammocks. Don Carlos, Ana, and all of the staff were impeccable and kind throughout. We liked it so much that we decided to stay on-site our entire stay. This is an"
"I just love Prana.  From the owners to the staff to the wonder ambience. The beautiful oasis atmosphere. the nice pool, bar and restaurant area. Great comfort food. Very helpful staff.  Always available to grab me some hot water for my tea, or a refill on my drinking water.  Can't wait to go back next year!"
"My stay in DayTripper Hostel was amazing! The entire staff is so welcoming and helpful. Great ambient and it almost feels like its just a big family! Highly recommended, if you want to experience Tulum as a nomad!"
"I stayed there for 4 nights and it was incredible! The rooms are super comfortable and have everything you could need, great beds, pillows and a safe! Also, a great view from every room. The location is fantastic! Views to die for and very quiet! A 5 min walk from a cenote if u ever get tired of the beach. The service was absolutely fantastic! Probably the best service I've ever had in a hotel. The food was delicious! A wide variety of options and at a reasonable price. They also have an excursion center ru"
"I ve been there as a trade worker for 2weeks and a little more, what a fantastic place, you are completely surrounded by jungle, no noise pollution at all, all you can hear it's birds and his few wild chicken 😜 in the nights without any light pollution the starry sky its just breath taking, definitely a place where to reconnect with nature or just take a break from the party towns, in here you got all the facilities need it to leave here : hot showers, kitchen, laundry machine, a swimming pool to deep in, h"
 would love to give Quintana Roots a 10 star rating!!
"Amazing and relaxing. Our room faced the ocean and every detail was perfect! We need to find out what ingredients are in the Mr Green juice drinks we had every morning so we can continue to have them back home! From breakfast to lunch on the beach to dinners, everything was perfection."
This review is LONG overdue as my fiancé and I stayed at Ajal in May of 2021 but here we go! Ajal is pure magic. Don Carlos and his entire staff went above and beyond to make sure our stay was absolutely perfect. Every single detail of our time there was flawless. The location within the jungle is out of this world. The food and drinks are to die for and experiencing sunset from the sky table is an something we will never forget. Don Carlos pours so much of his heart into Ajal and you will feel it from the 
"Prana is an absolutely gorgeous hotel in a stunning setting. The staff is amazing and the lady at the front desk is a sweetheart!! We rented the suite which was huge and had an amazing plunge pool on our deck. The deck felt like you were sitting in a treehouse. Loved the free breakfast and all the food and drinks we had at Nido was excellent. Their cat, Nikita, hung out with us in our room and on our deck in the sun. So cute! Beautiful pool and very chill vibe throughout. Met the owner who seemed like a gre"
"The hostel is great! I keep coming back here. It has a special vibe and attracts a nice kind of people. The hostel is clean and the terrace is a social hub. Beware of the Roman the Russian though, don't daydrink with that guy!"
"This was a wonderful place to stay. The staff was super helpful and friendly - I had some lovely conversations during my solo trip. Many reviews have said it before but the food was excellent, and an incredible value. The restaurant has a balcony with excellent views of the beach. They are also very accommodating to dietary restrictions. The room was very comfortable and everything worked well. The weather wasn't great during my stay so I didn't do any swimming/kayaking, but the grounds were still beautiful"
" water, just fantastic!! The place is still underway, but slowly many trees will be plant and the property will get more pretty day by day, If you want to spend a great time away from everything this is a  place to try 👍🏼"
…
Me and my friend stayed in the hotel for a week in December. It was a really amazing experience since the moment we arrived. David was a great point of contact that helped a lot during our stay. The only thing I would recommend is increasing lit in the rooms. Apart from that  all great.
 ❤️
 which we ended up doing. This particular day there were a lot of screaming kids running everywhere. Might have been an unusually busy day. The staff were very apologetic and we were compensated for the hassle. It was super quiet the rest of the week. This was my only reason for giving Prana 4 and not 5 stars. Great location off a side street and walking distance to the town of Tulum. We really liked Prana and wouldn't hesitate to go back. 
"It was a great transition away from the fast-paced, party atmosphere Tulum has. This is still a great location close to the main downtown street, but it is nicely hidden from the craziness of it all. Everyone who stays here is on the same page with chill vibes. The breakfast was a plus!! Sharing a meal with the guests (on your own time) was something that was very needed to create a nice little community-feel."
"This is the third time we have stayed at Casa Altamar. This time with the whole family! Me, my wife and two daughters (4 and 8 years old), brothers-in-law with two sons (6 and 7 years old) and like the other times we had exceptional service! Everything works very well and the beach is calm and idyllic! This is without a doubt our hotel in Tulum! We know 29 countries and this is one of our main indications to friends!"
…
I was solo traveling during low season and found this hostel way too empty (ended up moving somewhere else). People didn’t hang out in the common areas and the rooftop bar was empty.  It’s also on the edge of town.  The rooms were extremely clean and the AC worked well.  During busy season or when traveling with a group this is probably a great place to stay.
"I stayed in a private room in Hostel Sheck, now Malinche for 8 days. My room is as advertised, clean, with plenty of storage space, and with AC. Good facilities, there is common space you can chill at and cleaning lady cleaning your room everyday. Good location yet quiet at night. Love the staff here, receptionist Gustavo is super friendly and helpful and speaks good English, we became friends by the end of my trip. Overall is a good BnB experience."
"This hotel is advertised as ""chill boutique hotel"" but it was very hard difficult to chill and relax after a disappointing first night.  Granted I booked the least expensive room ( $1231 for 4 nights including IVA and service fee - $307 per night), there were numerous issues that were just unacceptable.  The bed linens were so old that one can feel the pilling .  As the room was very poorly lit, I thought it was indeed sand but it was actually pilling.  One hand towel was dingy, almost light brown with fray"

"Perfect hostel for whatever you’re looking for. They have a chilled social rooftop area and bar, music goes off at 12am so you can have a good sleep, staff can always recommend a fun party, nice breakfast that changes everyday, central location, kitchen has what you need. Super hospitable and caring staff & owner (went out of their way to help me when I was sick, thank you!!). Enough bathrooms and showers, cleaned every day. Bunk beds don’t shake and offer privacy."
"My friends and I loved this hotel! We stayed over my birthday in May, and I can not say enough about the staff, location, food, amenities and more. The team at Casa Altamar felt like our longtime friends by the time we left, as they constantly greeted us by name, knew our ""usual"" orders, and went out of their ways to help us - I think every one of them individually even knew, and wished me a happy birthday, on the day.   The food was AMAZING! I often thing that food in Mexico is a little too ""gastronomic"" a"
"Incredible area in the jungle completely self sufficient with solar panels and fresh underground river water coming out of the taps.   It has a dedicated communal kitchen area with private rooms to stay in dotted around the jungle.  Avacados falling from the trees the size of your head, orange trees and lots more 😍.  In the morning and the evening there are tropical birds everywhere including toucan's.   Over all a perfect place to escape to with no sounds but the birds and the wind."
"They are such a nice people! =), I went with a friend for 2 days and they were so kind and offer a delicious breakfast, but you have to do it by yourself. big rooms! great bed and shower so clean. Tulum it was the best for me!, the beach and ruins, could use bike everywhere... the food, and moust of it people =)."
Staff friendly giving lots of good advise on things to do Room was cool and comfortable with air conditioning  Friendly dog included plus great breakfast  Bar was quite as off season not so many traveler's  Realaxing  spot but bring your ear plugs
" generally ""empty"" and ""minimalist"".   The redeeming quality is the beach and location.  And to be fair, the front desk did compensate in part for a rather disappointing stay ."
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. We were fortunate enough to have the whole place to ourselves for the first 2 nights. Boy, did we take advantage of that. We had an in-room message, cooking class and Sky Table dinner. The place is so peaceful and romantic. John, the owner hand-picked his outstanding staff. Each treehouse has been appointed with local art, and the wood for the treehouses comes from the area. I cannot say enough good things about this hidden gem. We will be back! Thank you Ajal Tulu"
"An event i was attending for 5 days was based here.  i met one of the owners on a trip a few years ago and he told me about this place. Not sure why it took me so long to visit, but i am already scheduling a trip back for next year. The food was not too fancy, but really excellent.  The atmosphere was  how i can best describe as an Oasis.  The surrounding neighborhood is not fancy, and it does not look like too much on the outside.  However, when i walked in to Prana,  i felt as if i was transformed to a ne"
"The hostel itself is ok. The paintings are nice. You have curtains in front of your bed that's good but the room smells. The staff was the most unfriendly staff I've ever experienced. They were on sth all day long, but not in the relaxed way but in a very unfriendly, not reacting, super slow, annoying way. I felt like doing sth really bad by asking questions for instance. It's not allowed to drink your own alcohol in the hostel because they have a bar, but the cocktails at the bar taste like sh**. the break"
" booked massages under the palapa - and nothing could have been better. Valentina, one of the servers, kept us well hydrated with margaritas and entertained with jokes!   It's about a 20 minute drive from the craziness of Tulum, which was perfect for us, as while we enjoyed popping in a few times for dinner at Heartwood and The Kitchen Table, we preferred to stay outside of the ""scene."" I would highly recommend this hotel, and can't wait to come back."
"Patrick and Cecy are great hosts that will make you feel very comfortable. Their place is fantastic in the middle of the jungle connected to the fauna and flora and the sky which is wonderful during night! Still you have great commodities with good internet, electricity (all powered by solar panels), so that even to work remoted it s possible! Access to warm water to shower. I really recommend this peace place for an authentic expérience and reconnection to the nature and your innerself!"
Great place! Clean and accesible. Really close to Tulum Mayan Ruins archeological park. Making a road trip around the peninsula and this place is the best so far. Though it has no parking place there is plenty of space in the street. It's a very safe place.
"Booked Hostel Sheck because of the reviews and photos on Hostelworld. In the Hostelworld description it says “towels for hire” and guess what? There’s NO towels to rent. I had to walk to DayTripper Hostel to rent a towel as the staff is a lot more accommodating/friendly. WiFi was horrrible at the Sheck. Bathrooms? Bring a flashlight!! Walking outside in the dark is difficult! My bed had small bugs that would randomly appear on my sleeping sheet in the night. Not sure if they’re coming from the grass roof, o"

"Wow, where do I even start. If you want a special and unique 5 star experience without the hustle and bustle of a large resort,  I highly recommend you give Ajal a try. Everything was perfect, staff was wonderful and so helpful with anything we needed or wanted. Don Carlos (GM) went above and beyond to make our honeymoon unforgettable. Anna and Lux (massage therapist) provided us with the best massage of our lives right in our treehouse. And greeted us with soothing hot tea to follow. Try a private cooking "
"Prana Boutique Hotel was the perfect respite in the midst of Tulum. Upon entering this walled oasis, chill music greets your ear, a cat (Nikita) says hello and a dog (Flaca) chills out. The rooms are simple, comfortable, and private. Large showers, two sinks, and eco-friendly soaps, along with a pitcher of bottled water await you.  The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We got amazing recommendations for restaurants in town and on the beach, as well as beaches to visit or just great places to see the"
"Just what a simple traveller need: cheap, AC, bar with good prices, BEST HOSTEL BREAKFAST (included), nice staff, chill atmosphere, great music, alright beds, shower with good enough pressure, good kitchen! Highly recommend 👍"

"I stayed here for 3 weeks and had a wonderful time. Patrick and Cecilia were very accomodating and welcoming with their beautiful jungle paradise.  The set up is very environmental. The electricity is solar, so no noisy generators running all day. They have a well with delicious water sourced from an underground river. Delicious organic fruits from trees that they planted with their own hands (papaya,banana, lime, coconut, guanavana and more than I know)  They provided at various times chicken, turkey and p"
"Stayed here for 3 nights in a private room with my boyfriend. Absolutely loved this place! It is so clean and comfortable, close to everything in tulum but in a nice quiet location! Mario was so helpful and gave us so many good tips. Would definitely stay here again "

"So so awesome place to stay at Tulum, clean and nice facility... The best staff ever... Very friendly you really feel at home (or even better), awesome bar prices and the grill man! The grill!!! Such delicious and affordable food... Awesome place, awesome people, awesome grill and awesome bar prices... Just AWESOME!"
 owner John!! I could go on and on.. but do yourself a favor and book your stay now! enjoy your stay with the Ajal family! We will be back for sure.
" drink, always different each day we were there. Seriously, if I had that breakfast every day of my life I’d be happy.  The pool was small and cool and refreshing. World music playing was chill and not at all like some of the club music playing on the beach.   My wife loved the ambiance and thoughtful design. It feels more special than the average hotel or B&B. It’s a very peaceful nook, a home from home, and I cannot wait to return to Tulum and stay there.   Like others said, the free bikes are a nice touc"
"Ive had an amazing stay in this hostel! The staff is so friendly and helpful, the rooms are getting cleaned every day, the breakfast is great - it changes every day,including tea or coffee. There are nice places at the hostel where you can relax, it’s also quite close to the center, you can also rent a bike from the hostel and get good recommendations by the staff what to do in Tulum.  I would definitely stay here again, had such a great time there!"
"Casa Altamar was so great on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. We arrived late for our first night and the staff was waiting for us and had prepared a meal in case we were hungry. The room was perfect: hot water, working AC, clean sheets and amazing shower + products. The food there was constantly great. My friend travelling with me has many food allergies and they went the extra mile to account for it. The staff made us feel at home from the very beginning. They were so kind and always offe"
" I'm not much of a birdwatcher but there was birds of all colours, and it was great to see Ricans stealing in for a nip at the papaya trees.  The kitchen bar/is a great place to gather, with slabs of local wood fit to create the tables/chairs and bar. It's a nice place to sit and watch the birds in the morning with a coffee and a pair of binoculars.  Patrick and Cecilia took me on a tour of a private cenote with a friend. It was huge and we had the whole place to ourselves. I went on a few adventures with P"
We had a private room that was clean and stylish. Loved that the hosts spoke English and that they were very helpful. Handy to the bike path to the beach as well as close to a large market and the action in the town. Great place to meet other travellers.
"Mpre like a family than staff, made some great friends here. Perfect if you want a bit of a party or to chill. Best rooftop view in Tulum! Cant speak highly enough of Quintana Roots! Also a great dive shop!"
Best place in Tulum for price range! We had a great time here. The rooms are clean. And the staff is great. The location is amazing. Great place to spend few days and absorb the atmosphere of Tulum. We will be happy to be back soon :) 
"Already in my first steps at the hostel, I've already felt very welcome by the place, with a pretty nice green deco full of trees and wooden furniture.  The staff is very helpful and friendly, they put an effort to make you feel like part of the family and gather together with them, which is what I enjoy a lot in a hostel atmosphere! One of the crew members celebrated her birthday during my stay, and everyone invited all the guests to take part on the party!  I definitely would like to come back there and e"

"We stayed at Prana for 2 nights and we had a great experience. Their pool is open for all night which was great to keep our little son enjoyed until his bed time. The atmosphere of the hotel was amazing, it makes you feel like you are in Tulum!  Their  included breakfast has 2 options: One option was Mexican style egg breakfast and the other one was yogurt and granola with dried fruits. Their options was ok for us but I feel like they could make it more flexible for guests. If you select something else from"
" could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you're thinking about booking nights at this hotel, just do it. You'll have an amazing time. Note that the hotel is about 10min by car away from Tulum and is in a very quiet and peaceful setting. Team Altamar, Thanks for everything:) Louis & Mans"
"I was happy with my stay here. It was clean, good value, all the dorms have fans and some even have a/c, the WiFi is really good, nice breakfast, good beds, good rooms and very kind and helpful staff. I would definitely stay here again."
"We stayed in a private room for two nights, enjoyed the hearty breakfasts and found Miguel behind to bar to be super helpful in planning our daily activities. Though the staff (and friends?) tend to hang around in the common area which creates a weird vibe, like you’re interrupting something. But no qualms about the room."
Wow wow wow! Possibly the most unique experience I've had the opportunity to do in all my travels. Our visit started with a private couples massage and cocktail in our tree house room followed by a sunset looking over the jungle from the lookout tower. Dinner in the jungle was amazing too. The next day we had a private swim in the amazing nearby cenote. We were the only people there! All staff were amazing especially Don Carlos. The owners were lovely too and we had the perfect holiday in the jungle.
 it was a great experience because of the atmosphere and the friendly staff.
…
"This place is amazing!!! It is located 1.5 kilometers down a gravel road in the jungle just south of Tulum. It is private. There are 4 tree houses but we only saw one other couple there. The treehouses surround the jungle cantina where they serve fresh, delicious food and drinks. Don Carlos, the general manager was so nice. He helped us reserve electric motos and gave us tips on things to do. Everyone there is so nice and friendly. Don Carlos made our cocktails in the evening with fresh squeezed lemons and "
"Awesome hostel, best in Tulum! Amazing activities organised every day and great clean rooms with privacy curtains. Free breakfast included which was also incredible. My three nights here were not enough. I shall definitely be returning. 5/5"
"This was my first trip outside of Canada in many years and first solo trip. I stayed at two other hostels on my entire vacation. This hands down was the best hostel I've been to so far. The others I stayed at don't even come near the overall experience I got here.  I truly feels like you are part of a family here. There's usually somebody at reception you can chit chat with. Lots of the staff are volunteers. They are involved with the day trips and events themselves. Everything is planned adhoc, so never fo"
" where travelling in groups. This one it was more solo travellers or very small groups.  Complaints would be is I think the breakfast is a bit small, looks around 500-600 calories. But, it doesn't seem common to get a free breakfast either at hostels. And the kitchen feels small if you wanted to cook your own food.  It you are staying in Tulum, this is the only place you should be staying at. If you want to check out the other hostels, go there in the day to drink and party. "

"After renting a penthouse in Playa Del Carmen for a month, I finally came to my senses and took the advice of one of my most respected & favorite travelers (@karlwatson18), who stayed here while visiting Tulum himself (pre-covid times). I decided to make the move and cannot recommend this place more. The staff are enjoyable, warm when you need them to be, and always helpful. As you can imagine, running a hostel during these tumultuous times has got to be one of the most challenging jobs in the travel indust"

"With all that is going on in the world at the moment, I had a chance to reflect on the places I have been. To this day, when I think about my favorite hostel I've ever been to, Mama's Home comes to mind. I have been here twice, once in January 2018 and again in March 2019. The first trip could not have been more perfect. I met amazing people from all around the world, visited beautiful places, hung out at the beach and danced all night. It was so amazing, I decided to come back a year later.   The most rece"
" This place has a beautiful way of making you feel comfortable while providing you with opportunities to experience the culture of the area. If you are traveling here in the future, stay at Mama's home. You won't regret it."

A really pleasant stay. We were 2 couples from Ireland and spent 5 nights here for New Years. Christian and his mum were excellent hosts and made us feel so welcome. The home baked Italian cake with breakfast was a real treat! The rooms are very spacious and perfectly clean. All newly decorated and a lovely vibe. Would def recommend howlita for a budget friendly stay in tulum.
"Howlita is a simple hotel in Tulum, but very cozy, well located (nice to use bikes). The staff is so kind and helpful and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Breakfast is very nice too... I would definitely go back there!"
I have stayed at Xcanan since 2006. It was the best kept secret with a shaded beach and an amazing staff. Early this year (2021) it was literally taken over by new management. The vibe completely changed from warm and friendly to cold and icy. Blaring music all night long that made the concrete blocks vibrate. The staff from the old management that everyone loved has moved on.
"Excellent place to stay, feels very quiet and out of the way, but near the city centre. Very friendly, professional and helpful staff. Loved the building style, feels like in the middle of forest. Good sized room, good facilities. "
"Lovely place to stay, we really enjoyed it. Nice, spacious and clean rooms. Good bed and we had a nice balcony. I am glad we decided to stay for 3 nights instead of 2. Very friendly and helpful staff!  The pool is really nice and clean. Good beds to chill for a few hours (even after checking out).   We enjoyed the breakfast, every day fresh fruit, yoghurt, toast and good coffee!"
"My boyfriend and I took the tour to Casa a tortuga cenotes from Tulum. Overall friendly service, but really all they do is pay the entrance fee and take you there and back. We had rented a car for the trip so there was really no reason for us to go through iTour but you live and you learn. ALSO upon arrival to Casa Tortuga they will stop by a tequila shop at the entrance next to the other souvenir shops. Whatever you do, don’t be fooled and buy the $250 El Jefe Reserva that they try to push on you! They cla"
"I stayed here for a week and was blown away by the entire experience. Fabio and staff were incredibly welcoming and extremely friendly. The location, not only in proximity to the beach, is as good as it gets. Its located close to all the best restaurants and bars. If I had a question or needed help with something (clothes washed, etc.), they made sure it happened. Can't wait to stay here again. See you all soon!"
"First time we stayed at Xcanan was 2016. We were exactly or even more satisfied this time. Its a nice coozy Place with nice rooms. First time we stayed in the bungalow on the beach and this time in the suite one floor up. Both rooms very nice but higher standard in the suite of course. We really love this place. Fabio is so very nice, kind and serviceminded and so is his staf. Allways serving breakfast on the porch at the time we wanted. Also xcanan is very good located with many good restaurants nearby. Go"
"It is a really charming place, perfect for couples. Breakfast is included and really nice. The pool is very beautiful as well and the rooms are very clean and have an AC. The Hotel is very close to the center and you can rent bikes. The staff helps you out with a lot of recommendations! "
We had a great time at Howlita. We went here on recommendation and we were not disappointed. Our room was nice and clean and the breakfast was great. What we liked most were the people at Howlita. Jesus and Joshua were very friendly and helpful. They took their time to show us around and inform us about Tulum. It felt really personal and it really made us feel welcome. Thanks guys and hope to see you again in the future!  Vishaal and Raveena
"Stayed here for 1 night on our way to Bacalar. Location is closer to the beach, about 15 mins walk from the Ado bus station. Room was clean, shower was hot. Service was friendly. Amazing breakfast. Good value for money."
"Playa selva was such a nice, hidden gem in a perfect location around the hustle and bustle of tulum but still nice and quiet. It was walking distance to everything we needed! I searched and searched for a decently priced place in tulum and they are few and far between in the hotel zone, especially for what you’re getting which is why o was so stoked to have stumbled upon Playa Selva. Spacious Bungalows on the beach for a reasonable price that are quiet and have a private beach. You can’t beat it!"
"We had such a wonderful time at Playa Xcanan and it was because of two things - Fabio is the most wonderful host we’ve ever encountered anywhere, and the room was wonderful. Quaint and quiet and only steps from the beach. Home made pancakes and fresh fruit and juice and eggs for breakfast every day included in room rate - so good! Make sure to ask Fabio for lunch and dinner suggestions and any other question about what to see and do while you’re there in Tulum - he’s been here for over 20 years and knows th"
"Everything was perfect! Fabio was very kind all the time! Breakfast is amazing! Full of options! Location is one of the best things of the property, near all the coolest bars and restaurants. Definetly I recommend and I want to be back soon!  felicitazioni fabio!! "
"The ultimate property for your Tulum travels. This is my 2nd time staying at Mahayana and it is a true oasis. This is a one of a kind experience especially for the typical bustle of Tulum. Mahayana feels like it's own little universe and dreamy beach escape while being in a prime location. Every little detail from the room decor, to raw wood of the mirrors and the outdoor showers is exceptional. I can't recommend this property enough."
Great stay at Howlita! A friend of mine had stayed there 3 months earlier and recommended. 0 disappointment. We had such a great time by the pool and really enjoy the quietness in the room. Loved all the tiny details in the decoration.
"What a wonderful stay we had at Howlita Hotel.   We travelled for good three weeks through the Yucatan and Howlita was by far our favourite stay. Warm welcome, very pretty and clean room, friendly staff and a delicious breakfast - what more could you ask for!   Walking distance from the center and restaurants.   PERFECT "
We just arrived at the hotel and Miguel knew out names before we even checked in.  I liked him right away because this never happend before and I travel a lot. I speak spanish and love the latin culture so I really felt like at home. He always ask if everything is okay and helps you out like a tourist guide.  I was so sad that I left after 2 days because I booked another hotel. It was not the same at all. Plus the Itour is kind of at the main street close to the center. At Itour we could use bikes for free 
 but Miguel deserved one. Couldn‘t do it short because he is just great.  Gracias Miguel Te quiero mucho 
"To attest to how wonderful and helpful the owners and staff are - we originally came to Playa Selva because we were directed here incorrectly by a site where we’d booked a different place. Pepe, the owner, let us park our rental there and did everything he could to help us find the place we’d booked, but after futile hours of searching we gave up and asked if he had any rooms there… thank God he did! He and the staff were responsive, helpful, and kind. The location is perfect - right on the beach on the sou"
Fabio the owner was incredible!!!!!! Thank you so much for having me!!! It was home away from home!! U r such a hard worker and ur staff are incredible! The location is unbelievable and the room was incredible! I never leave reviews but it was just such a wonderful experience I had to leave a review! I’ll be seeing u in December x
Tulum has grown so much since our last visit and we were a bit overwhelmed by the change. Every store and accommodation trying to be super chic and so eager to charge you for it.  Thank goodness for Fabio who’s been there twenty years and keeping it real. He could have overbuilt the property to squeeze more people in but didn’t. There’s space to breathe and just lay out. The cabana we had was front and center with a spacious porch and postcard view.    The other reviews are spot on when describing Fabio as 
"We stayed in Casa Bonita! It was an unforgettable trip. Pictures do not accurately capture the magic of Mahayana. I was blown away when we arrived. Chabely was extremely helpful in arranging our airport transport. Miriam was a delight to work with as well. She arranged a private chef, massages and was always available for questions. We felt very welcome and at home. It is a short walk to town but far enough away that you can sleep in peach and quiet. We will absolutely be back!"
"The hotel is beautifully decorated. The swimming pool (area) is great. Would have been even more great if there were cold drinks available at the pool bar (bringing your own is also possible ofcourse!). The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's very nice they have a lot of tips to make your stay in Tulum worthwhile (despite of the seaweed problem). The room was very beautiful as well. The mattress isn't very comfortable (you can feel the springs in your back), but you get used to it. Although it was nic"

"The hotel rooms are nice size, clean and great decor. Hotel is conveniently located between everything, right by supermarket, restaurants, etc. Provides free bikes, free full breakfast, and owner is friendly and very helpful. "
Words cannot express how wonderful Zorba and the entire staff that work at Zorba are. My fiancé and I rented out the entire group of villas for our friends and family to celebrate our wedding. It was INCREDIBLE!! Every villa is STUNNING and so unique. The taco stand serves the most delicious food and drinks (you gotta try the ceviche and fajitas). Juan and Javier were excellent chefs and so kind!!   Miriam and Chabely were so attentive and answered any and all questions promptly. They helped me craft an inc
"Beatiful secret place hidden behind small wood gate with nice yard with pool, a steps from main street in Tulum. Super service and in first line Mrs. Jana - always with smile, always with tips and information for activities in Tulum and Yucatán, great great, great, ... This is Mango hotel. We lived here 4 days only, but feld like at home from first minute. You don´t want go ahead, because you know - better place wil be not. Speciálně pro Čechy a Slováky - s Janou je supr pokec a navíc se jen tak mimochodem "
" comfortable. The drawbacks are things that are ubiquitous in the area and that the hotel has no control over - sometimes unreliable WiFi, and construction in the area. The only thing was that our thatch roof did leak when a storm came through, so be aware of the weather, but - overall a fantastic treasure of a find on Tulum Beach with excellent value. We’ll stay here next time we’re in Tulum."

" string a hammock on the porch next time.  Check the sargassum seaweed report before booking a flight. It’s along the entire coast. It’s blooming from all the nitrogen US and Brazilian farmers are pumping into our rivers.  While sargassum is a great base to the sea food chain, it’s way too much and is ending up on Yucatan shores.  Fabio says “winter” is best time but that’s also high season.  But if you’re going to Tulum, you couldn’t ask for a better host than Fabio."

Stayed at Zorba for 6 nights What an amazing experience Everyone was very nice and helpful  Food was amazing at the Taco Shack that’s right on the premises If we return to Tulum we would definitely stay there again. The views from the house of the ocean was beautiful
"I'm So thankful to the staff at this hotel. They were very friendly , helpful and provide great advice. Everyday we returned to a clean room with towels beautifully arranged on the bed , air conditioning and ceiling fan. I had rented a car and the parking is in direct line of sight of the concierge and the staff keeps watchful eye. Every morning there is a light breakfast and coffee available to prepare you for the days adventures. The hotel is located on the Main Street. Directly across the street is a yum"
 like home. It was the best four days of my life and I will be reliving all the memories in my mind forever.   Thank you to all the staff at Zorba. You are one of a kind. 
"My girlfriend and I spent some days in Tulum back in January. The service at Mangos Hotel was awesome. Jana was very attentive and always had great recommendations for restaurants, bars, grocery stores and for pretty much everything about how life in Tulum works. She was really helpful. If I come back to Tulum I’ll definitely be staying with them again."
"The Playa Selva is a wonderful place to stay Tulum. The bungalows are great and the location is in front of the sea next to the main attractions of the place. In addition, it has a communal kitchen. Considering Tulum's prices are pretty high, this is a wonderful option to save on food. I loved the place, the atmosphere and highly recommend it."
"I have to agree with the other reviewers: yes the site is nice and central along the beach (La Zebra and the Mulberry Project bar close by, and our best meal of the entire trip was a new restaurant Bak Nul right across the street. Had the best octopus anywhere around Tulum, and creative dishes), but the friendly helpful Fabio kicked everything up to another level. Our room was fabulous: 2nd floor overlooking the beach through the palm trees (see attached pic). When we were shown the room, we just stood ther"
"We spent a week at Casa de Las Palmas for my wedding, and it was such a magical time. I can't speak more highly of the on-site staff (Miriam in particular) and how accommodating they are. Mahayana is a very special, unique place which allows you to feel secluded while having all of the attractions of Tulum nearby. I highly recommend staying here."

"Good location, everything in walking distance. Jana, the host is extremely nice and helpful: she responded to all our questions and concerns immediately! If you visit beautiful Tulum I can only recommend staying there!"
The houses are clean and not to close to each other which makes it really nice. there is sand all around the houses and you don´t need shoes to walk around. there is a kitchen for everyone to use with an icebox for every house so you can put your food inside. Mauricio is one of the nicest people we´ve ever met. He is the owner of Playa Selva and with Bebe he can help you with every need. We had such a great time talking to him and his brother. Playa Selva is one of the rare places in Tulum which is not a Be
"As soon as you pass through the gate to Mahayana off the busy hotel zone road, you know you have entered a very special place,  We were fortunate to have rented Casa Gaia which is situated only 50 to 60 steps from the sea and yet it is very private. You would be hard pressed to find a more relaxing and romantic spot.  From the spectacular sunrises to the sound of the waves lulling you to sleep at night, this is an incredible oasis.  The staff are second to none from pre-trip communications with Snow through"
"We booked the Sian Ka'an Deluxe Tour by boat and it was defineteky worth the money! Our guide Abraham was great! We had a really great day, saw dolphins, alligators and sea turtles. Lunch at Punta Allen was also delicious and well organized. Thanks to the entire itour team and especially Abraham for an unforgettable trip off the beaten path."
"Our family of four stayed in Villa 1 for four nights and had a fantastic experience. The villa is right on the beach, the architecture is gorgeous, everything feels brand new and the service is phenomenal. The homes are very secure, gated with a security guard patrolling throughout the night, and the water heat and pressure, air conditioning, WiFi and other services are all top notch (better than expected given the eco nature of Tulum). The swimming pool is large and relaxing, and the grounds are beautiful "
Jana is definitely an amazing being and manager. She hosted us like prince and princess 🙏 gave us tips and many super useful hints about how to deal with Tulum ! Very recommended place ! Safe and clean atmosphere ! Very fast responding on social media ! Thank you !
"We spent 5 days at the mango tulum hotel and it was very amazing. The hotel was close to the mains restaurants and bars of the city. Also close to the beach and the archeological site of tulum. Jana was very attentive and she answered all our requests. She also gave us some very nice adresses. If you go in Tulul, you must to go at mango hotel."

Tulum does have a major seaweed problem, and your experience will depend on the clean up efforts of the property where you stay. There were some properties on the north end of the beach where the beach was completely covered and the stench was unbearable.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Mango Tulum hotel in town. My room was so clean and comfortable including the bathroom. I found the location to be very convenient and central to everything i needed. I rented a bike from just around the corner and loved riding it around to anywhere i needed to go including the beach area. Mango Tulum is just off of the road to the beach where the bike path starts. It really is a great hotel in a great location with an exceptional value. Jana the manager was always there

Really nice owner who helped us a lot with her good tips. The hotel is perfectly situated at the entrance of tulum in a quiet street. Nice jungle patio with pool and not a lot of rooms in the hotel which keeps it intimate!  
"We booked for just 1 day and stayed 4 days at Mango Hotel.  Everything was perfect, Jana and the team are very kind, always here to advice you for our trip.  The bedroom are clean and very comfortable.   We will came back !  Thank you again"
"We were in Tulum 12 years ago and have fond memories of our quiet beachfront room, listening to the ocean and birds and walking along the beach. We decided to come back for those reasons but did not realize that Tulum is very different and commercial now.  What a shock it was for us who are in our 60's and were looking for another  relaxing beach experience. Playa Selva to the rescue!  Playa Selva is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Tulum beach. It is located at the quiet southern end of the beach withi"
"Mahayana is a perfect place to stay in Tulum.  We rented three of the five homes:  Casa de las Palmas, Casa Bonita, and Casa Gaia and couldn’t have asked for anything better.  Other family members rented the two remaining houses so we had the entire property for our week long family gathering.  The location of Mahayana is ideal.  We walked everywhere, both by street and beach.   Before our arrival, Snow, Miriam and Chabely were so helpful and responsive in everything, from choosing which houses would be bes"
"Zorba is larger than life in it's unparalleled beachside beauty. The property, the pool, outdoor space is absolutely breathtaking. This is the ultimate destination for a girls getaway, family trip or couples trip. It is so spacious and gorgeously designed.   The property is owned by the most incredible family and Chablez is an absolute saint - the host manager - the rooftop is accessible to all guests and the most incredible spot to watch the sunset. I can't recommend this property enough."
"Jana, the manager, is awesome and so helpful- she was able to organize a taxi for a fair price which I really appreciated, plus gave some great recommendations for cenotes. Mango is located really well, right in town, but off the main road so not too loud. The rooms are comfortable and come equipped with aircon and a mini-fridge. The free drinking water is also a nice touch. Although I didn't have time to use the pool it was nice to have it on the property. I would definitely stay again!"
We had a wonderful stay at the Mango Tulum Hotel.  Clean rooms. Great service.  The secluded pool/garden area was very nice.  Quiet part of town and a short walk to restaurants and bars.  Will definitely stay here again the next time we're in Tulum.
" amenities. I loved the communal kitchen where we met other fellow travelers and could do some light meal prep. Loved the vibe, its small size and oceanfront location. The beach is wonderful and we appreciated the comfortable beach beds and quiet location. Please do not hesitate to book Playa Selva if you want to come to Tulum but do not want to be in the middle of the party scene. It is the only place left that we could see that would give you this feeling of what Tulum used to be. Thank you Playa Selva fo"

The homes are beautiful, spacious, unique and comfortable and the property is designed with natural vegetation for privacy between houses. The beach is amazing with Caribbean white sand and warm water and the sunrises were spectacular every single day.  Mahayana is magical and we are all ready to go back!!"
"Our recent stay at Zorba was very nice. We were in town for a wedding and chose to stay at Zorba to accommodate our party which included three generations of guests :)   Our 3bd villa was accommodating and spacious. We appreciated the en suite bathrooms, the long breakfast table, balconies and the overall aesthetic of the home very much. Zorba is located an approximate 8-20 minute walk from “the action” depending on what you’re looking for. The quiet location was wonderful for our family lifestyle and we ve"

"Hotel very well located in downtown Tulum. Very clean and close to everything. The receptionist, Bety, was just amazing, so helpful with all our needs. Thanks again! : ) Breakfasts are healthy and served fresh. Sunsets on the rooftop are a must!"
"We came many times during our stay in Tulum to use the rooftop pool. There is a 100 pesos minimum consumption charge, which is incredibly reasonable. Also, since a beer is only 50 pesos, that can go a long way. The pool was a perfect temperature and the chairs were comfortable. The waitress was super friendly and hospitable. I would recommend a visit!  "
"This is a wonderful hotel in a really central location. Betty was so helpful with advice on where to go, hidden cenotes and booking taxis and trips (although options often more expensive than elsewhere but very easy and helpful).  The decor is really nice and the rooftop pool and bar are great. Air con is v good.  This hotel is noisy but I think all in this location would be. It wasn't really a problem for us. Only real negative is we found the shower quality/toilet/water pressure very poor but again not a "
"ARUMA Hotel staff was amazing!!! In specific Bety(she’s a start) all her recommendations made our trip a lot more fun!! Her advises every morning before to leave the hotel about all the activities and places to visit in Tulum and around were AWESOME. Food and location was amazing as well! The rest of the staff was really helpful and kind as well, Oscar was an amazing guy! "
"We stayed here for 5 days to explore everything that Tulum has to offer. As all young couples we searched the internet in advance in order to fill our stay with great restaurants and tours. However nothing beats the local advice. Every morning we discussed with the owner (Erwin) and never where we guided wrong. Erwin gave us the best tips, where to eat and where to go! The room is big and cleaned everyday. It is a bit outside of Tulum pueblo but easy to park our car and you can even rent a bike here for 100"
"Hotel is great for location in town. Close to all restaurants and popular bars.  The staff are lovely and have us some great recommendations of restaurants, cenotes and the lagoon. By taxi to the beach clubs it’s 150 pesos each way and about a ten minute drive. By bike it’s probably about 30 minutes."
"We loved our stay at Solera Tulum!  Th Hotel is like a little paradise. The atmosphere is cozy, familiar and relaxing. Everything is nicely done and decorated. There are plants everywhere and swimming in the pool feels like swimming in a cenote.  The room was really spacious and so nice. There is even a fridge with water every day.   The breakfast is delicious!   The hotel is located a bit outside, but that’s not a problem at all. With a cab you‘ll need 5minutes and pay 50 pesos. We rented a bike for a day "

"I had a truly awful experience at this resort - I would not go back even if someone paid me. Essentially, the hotel management lied to us multiple times - most egregiously about the club next door (which played EDM so loudly the walls shook until well past 3am). The wifi was not functional, and when we wanted to leave early, they agreed and then scammed us. I ended up paying thousands of dollars extra and trying to remove charges from my credit card. It has been awful. I did see some of the bad reviews but "
Stayed 10 days in the hotel and never had such great hospitality before. Owner and the whole team are incredible. We will definitely come back again. It was so great and we get many support from everybody.   Best grade A+++
 Special thanks to Betty for helping suggest and book activities for us and give us advice on the best way to get around.
They canceled our reservation and didn't tell us until we were checking in. The hotel uses Booking.com so you can't contact anybody at the hotel until you are there. Good luck trying to get through on the phone or a response via email. Turned out for the best I guess because the hotel is not well kept.
"The owner of the hotel was extremely nice and helpful to recommend different attractions and restaurants in the area. The hotel has great aesthetics, both inside and outside the rooms, and the breakfast was simple but great with made-to-order coffee and fresh fruit. There was a construction site next door but I couldn't hear them working from inside my room so it was no issue. Unfortunately, the way that the hotel is designed, you have to keep the curtains of your sliding glass door (which is the only sourc"

It’s very close to the Town Center with all of its fun shops and restaurants, and is an easy bike ride away from the beach. For frugal travelers, you could easily save money by preparing food in your apartment or outdoor kitchen area as well.

This time we decided to stay closer to the city center, and Residence Robinson Tulum was the perfect location. Martine was so accommodating - she gave us suggestions on where to eat, where to find bicycles to rent, fun local activities (go to salsa lessons at El Zebra - so much fun!!!), and showed us how to access all of the great things Tulum has to offer.

The air conditioning was much cooler, and the room felt cozier. Although the breakfast service was a bit slow, we really enjoyed the Mexican style eggs, as well as the fresh fruit drinks. It was a wonderful way to start each day. The workers are also extremely friendly, and we enjoyed our time with them. A definite highligh"
"This property is very small which is nice. This is not upscale and bougee’ but very quaint and simple and perfect. We were very secluded and had our own private beach area. The rooms were cleaned daily. Coffee, pastries and fruit are provided at 7 am. We stayed in a hut style room with no one connected to us which was amazing. The other 3 buildings on the property are duplex. Most may not know that this area of Tulum has a vibrant nightlife so if you are in bed early this is not the place for you. You can h"
Fraud! We booked online and came to checkin. They gave us a shared bathroom which we refused. The lady asked for 50$ to cancel the reservation (She took the money and cancelled one room). We went to another hotel. Still paid for this reservation... I also have an email from the manager (Gabriela) who had agreed in the email to refund but she didn't until now.......
We stayed here for 4 nights on our honeymoon Martina made us very welcome and informed us on where to go and where to eat and then gave us all the privacy we wanted. The Robinson residents is a very clean and home from home place to stay thank you Martina 😊

The pool is wonderful and the whole property is very clean and beautiful. It feels very safe, it is a fortress seriously with a locking gate.

"We enjoyed our stay at Residence Robinson tremendously. The rooms are very clean, the bed was comfy and the atmosphere is relaxed. It was nice and quiet so no problem getting a good nights sleep. When we had questions the host Martine was super helpful and she offered us the house own bicycles to use free of charge to get around town. We had a wonderful evening with a potluck BBQ with the other guests one night - overall a great place we can recommend to anyone that is looking to have a relaxing holiday wit"
"First, the rooms/suites are very nice. Rooms are nicely furnished and looks fresh and clean. Toilet and shower immaculate. Even looks like designer basins.  Now to the BIG problem. The rooms/suites are located next to a well trafficked road ( feels like a motorway). There are trucks/lorries that starts, stops and accelerate. There are cars, motorcycles and scooters/mopeds that pass. It seems like all or next to all are lacking mufflers/silencer. There are no sound barriers to the road and the road is just 1"

"We did tons of research to find a relaxing, simple and elegant place to stay in Tulum this year. Neither of us had been in over 12 years and we had heard that Tulum had grown out of control. We were so fortunate to find Libelula!  Our host, Jorge, was calm, attentive, pleasant and always happy to share whatever information we wanted, be it political or social questions about Tulum/Mexico, or just a good place to eat dinner (though it is hard to beat the food they offer there!). He was the perfect host, in o"

 hand they would have felt it. I challenge the owners/staff to spend 2 hours during daytime in the rooms and I dare them to try to sleep 2 or 3 nights in the room. Put up a sound barrier and I might come back.

" beach and property are both amazing. Nature at its finest. We were there in early December, so there was no seaweed in the water (I think in summer months it can be a problem). I would not call this ""glamping"" as you are in proper cabanas, not any sort of tent or yurt. I would also say that it is pricy, but you are paying for an environment that does not exist in Tulum anymore. All in all, the experience was magical and I hope that Libelula can stay as it is as long as possible...  The airport transfer ser"
"My husband and I stayed at one of the cabanas for 3 months, and it was wonderful. The property is easy to get to, and it's gated so it is very secure. Pavlina is a wonderful host, and I fell in love with her dog, Negrita. I spoiled Negrita with lots of belly rubs. Corazon de Selva is just a short walk from the main square andthe  main road in Macario, and I took morning walks around the square almost everyday. There are many places to eat nearby as well. The collectivo stop is at the square too. The propert"
"With the name yoga shala, I expected great vibes. I was the only one who stayed there and on the first night, their neighbor casa jaguar blared music until 4 am. Couldn't get any sleep. Nice staff but didnt go out of their way. Stuffy room...smelled a little moldy. Restaurant connected is alright, nothing special. Great location though."
"Yoga Shala is small little spot across the street from the beach so no beach view except for nice lookout tower.  Not all the rooms have bathroom but the price and cleansiness make up for it.  It is walking distance to Eufemia(cool spot with a “reggae” vibe read 420) and Clandestino, my favourite spot with a Cenote IN the restaurant. It has yoga classes but are an extra 20US(most spots are the same price) but I would recommend the others with the view on the ocean.... Actually, I found one of them which ask"
"First, I need to preface this review with the fact that our family is a ""stress test"" for everywhere we go. We have 3 younger, extremely spirited boys (nicknamed The Wolverine Monkeys), and we basically booked the whole hostel for 2 weeks to use as a home base with friends and family who met us in Tulum.   This is the best hostel I've ever stayed in and I travel the world for a living. The accommodations are clean, super cool in style (Lucha Libre, Frida and Tattoo themes!), with every amenity you need.   C"
"We arrived in the early morning from an overnight bus-journey coming from Palenque, but eventhough we were there hours before check in time, our room was being cleaned at that moment and 30min later we were able to move in. We did mention our early arrival in advance, so it was nice that they reserved the room that would be available the earliest.  The additional 5% for payments by credit card is a bit passé, in my opinion."
"Recently stayed at Maya Pax with two of my close friends. The place is gorgeous and we were very comfortable in our little apartment. The location is good, walking distance from the town center and there is a gas station/ convenience store just a couple of blocks away. Chiara, who is in charge, was very kind and if she wasn't at the reception you could reach her through WhatsApp. Avianca had broken my luggage and I needed to fill out a complaint form, she was nice enough to print it out for me and scan it o"

People! Do yourself a favor and if you are traveling to Tulum book a few days with Libelula. A small and cozy paradise with a great beach and bar. You rarely find such nice hosts and the food was heavenly. We were all happy and will be back! So don't miss it!
"If you are looking for an awesome, calm and very relaxed place away from busy Tulum, but just the right amount of time to get there, look no more. The location is perfect, colectivo goes from Tulum to Macario Gomez and back every hour for 25 pesos and if you are renting a car its just about 15 minutes or so. The place looks wonderful, its set in the jungle away from the road, its very peaceful and the atmosphere is indescribable. Pavlina is the best host you can wish for, always cheerful and very helpful. S"
"This was my family's second time staying at wonderful Yoga Shala Tulum. This low-key hotel is nestled in the jungle, just across the street from the beach, and the rooms are simple and chic, with very comfortable beds and pillows. The staff at Yoga Shala Tulum are kind and helpful people, and the yoga is consistently excellent. An affordable spot in a beach town that is growing and becoming more expensive each year."
" atmosphere of some hostels I have stayed in.   The kitchen is well stocked with basics and is vegetarian only. There is a grill up on the great rooftop lounge for carne y pescado. We're not vegetarian, but we really didn't miss cooking meat, at all. When we craved meat, we went on ""taco walks"" (the torta/taco stand in the AKI Supermercado parking lot is fantastic and CHEAP!). We had a great BBQ on the roof one night!  Alcohol is not allowed to be stored in the kitchen, which is another great feature that p"

"Stayed 9 nights here in March 2019. This was our 3rd visit to,Tulum so we’ve stayed in other hotels. Everyone was really friendly and the manger very helpful when we needed advice. The rooms were spacious with a king size bed. Cleaned daily. Self catering and just enough equipment but no kettle so we boiled in a pan. Fresh water is provided in each room for free in 20 litre containers with a pump on top. The grounds are well kept. The pool was the best we’ve had in Tulum. Not massive but they aren’t in Tulu"
"I went to Pavlina in her jungle oasis to get a birthday massage as an escape from the town. The change of air and the confidence and clergies of her massage transported me to total relaxation and renewal. The only thought I had left over in my head during and by the time she finished was how soon I could come back. The treatment was holistic and wholesome, relaxing and restorative with the sounds of the jungle and gentle Indian music playing. The smells and aromas she used by alternating creams and essentia"
 your own massage there to admire the process and leave nourished and spoiled.
"Stayed in a private twin room. It's described as new, but the hostel and room felt pretty run-down, with no charm. The location is convenient to the beach but on the edge of town. The room was a bit stuffy, poorly lit, and the a/c was weak. The staff spoke little to no English. Breakfast was very basic - some bananas, cornflakes, and bread with jam. We like stying in hostels to meet other travelers. But the place was half empty (during peak season) and people seemed to mostly keep to themselves."
Very Chilled hostel. Family run. Everything is kept clean and tidy. There's a decent kitchen but bear in mind that it's a vegetarian only kitchen. Dorms are really spacious with bathrooms. The bunks are extra wide with decent mattresses and there are lockers in the dorms. Nice pool and roof terrace to mix with other travellers. The only bad thing was no lock on bathroom door.
"We spent two nights at this place and was a good experience.. the service was pretty good, everyone was very friendly.. however there was just too much noise at night coming from the street which compromised a bit our sleep."
"very friendly hosts,very clean rooms,quiet place and good to rest.10 minute walk to the center in tulum.they offer bycicles to use for the day,and the host were always very helpful for giving us information."

"We where lucky to find Corazón de Cielo while on visit With out knowing of it but it really made our visit perfect. We got there and every thing was more than expected. The cabins are so nice and comfortable same as the spot it self it’s super relaxing, just perfect if you want to really recharge yourself. The host is amazing !!! As well as the staff !! We really felt like at home and can’t wait till we can go back. Thanks again for making our stay so great hope to see you soon.  Federico Trigueros"
"Pros:  - Right off of Carr Cancun - Tulum, which is full of shops and restaurants..lots of options and things to do at night  - Owner was very friendly and had some great suggestions for a tattoo place and even invited us to a private BBQ  - Free parking nearby for our rental - Pretty quiet, for us a pro  Cons:  - Place could use a good cleaning, bathrooms were dirty, room was damp and smelled a bit  - Lack of facilities.. no breakfast, washer/dryer.. just a pool that no one was using"
"Nice spacious bungalow with a big bed and a clean bathroom. If you stay only one night, it might be a little bit far from the centre. Everything was very clean and Very kind & helpful staff !! Thanks a lot !"
"We enjoyed our stay at Maya Pax. The Garden room was modern and large, with a comfy bed and good air-con, nice big bathroom and cleaned every day (of our 4 day stay).   Unfortunately we didnt get much sleep as there was a club pumping music every night or dogs barking or road traffic (so bring earplugs). It is quite far out of Tulum (20 minute walk) and at night felt un-safe walking down the dirt track to the main road (especially with our child).   Although the room was lovely, the surroundings didnt reall"
"I travelled alone for the first time and stayed with The beautiful warming guest Pavlina! Her beautiful forest is named Corazon de Selva and it is filled with love and plants and beautiful cabanas! She has two dogs that were so amazing to play with and kept me company! She took me to amazing places and has awesome recommendations for places to eat, galleries, yoga, and the beach! She gave me advice on traveling around tulum  and macario Gomez! Was magical and a very genuine loving stay! Felt protected and g"
"Lucky to experience this! Pavlina in warm and inviting! Offers an amazing holistic massage - recommend. Authentic. Rustic. Clean. Homey. For nature lovers away from the tourism hustle and bustle. 15 minutes for Mayan ruins, Punta Laguna, and Tulum center. Great local Mexican restaurants. Good WiFi. Comfortable safe place. Kitchen fridge. Highly recommend Cabana Nohoch."
"There's nothing particularly good or bad about this place, it just kind of coasts into the 'ok' category.  Good points: the room was spacious, had 2 double beds and the pressure of the shower was good. Bad points: the water supply to the taps and toilet didn't work at all for a couple of hours every morning, the pool was just a stagnant pond which I think played a big factor in the mosquito problem that we had! The location is ok if you don't mind a bit of a walk into the town for food etc.  Bonus: you get "

"Cosy and clean cabañas located in the jungle garden. Private bathrooms with hot showers. Good WiFi. English, spanish and italian are spoken. Very nice owner Pavlina offers also massages and food.  If you are looking for sth aside buzzing Tulum this is your place!"
"Good hostel and a really fair price. Basic breakfast included but more than enough. Really big double beds to yourself in the dorm rooms. Javi, the manager is really friendly and gives great advice on where to hire bikes, get your washing done, eat some local food and more. Great backpacker hostel atmosphere in a great location. "
"The place was really clean, staff made sure to leave everything spotless if the guests didn't. We stayed in a room for two with a private bathroom and although it was pretty dark, you can't expect too much from a $30 room in Tulum, as it was $15 each and that's just a bit more than you'd pay for a dorm anywhere. AC was on from 9 pm to 9 am and that seemed enough for us to keep cool during the night. There's no bar upstairs anymore so even though our room was right next to the common area, we could sleep wel"
" everything you might need but they're pretty strict about it being vegetarian, which wasn't a problem for us anyway. They also have a pool in the common area which you can use all day! Unlike previous guests said, we had sheets. The room gets cleaned everyday which is nice but they should really tell you about that, which they didn't. The location is not so amazing since you're quite a few blocks from the town of Tulum and a 30 min walk to the beach, but it's not terrible either. But all in all, great valu"
I really enjoyed my stay at Tropicalito. The hotel is located in a great area surrounded by lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The rooms are very spacious and clean. I highly recommend renting a bike from the shop next door and exploring the surrounding areas. Would stay here again!
"Fine little hotel right on the hotel strip and beach. Funky vintage design has some charm but some of the basics are just not looked out for. Curtains barely block light from coming in, the AC did not really cool down the room enough, the hot water took about 15 minutes to arrive and was somehow salty. Overall an interesting concept but the hotel basics are somewhat sketchy."
"Upon arrival, we were upgraded to the penthouse, which was very spacious and had an amazing view of the ocean! The design of the hotel exterior and interior is very cool, modern with a retro twist. Breakfast was included at a restaurant just a block away and was amazing! The staff was very nice and helpful. The location was perfect.... near the action but away from the craziness of the south end of the beach. I would recommend this hotel to adult travelers looking for a really nice, budget hotel."
"The hotel is really noisy as it is set right next to the main road and next to two restaurants that play really loud music. The hotel does not have the proper infrastructure to block noise, also, rooms have no privacy at all, anyone walking by the hallways can peek into the rooms, so you have to have the curtains closed all day.   It would have been good to know this before arrival, we had to cancel and find a new hotel last minute. It is a lot cheaper than the rest of hotels in the area for a reason."
"We stumbled upon Tropicalito for the high season (December holidays) and it offered a modern, clean and affordable stay tucked away in Tulum beach. A small spot with only a handful of rooms and immediate proximity to the beach, food and nightlife. Beat the resort crowds and stay closer to the beaches and local Tulum town.   Can get a bit loud at night due to the lively bars and food nearby. Ditch the car and rent bikes for sure! A/C blows cold, friendly service and great views."
"We loved our stay in Hotel Tropicalito! It's a great place to enjoy the stunning Riviera Maya. The service was just excellent! The manager was very helpful, and in general, all the staff was committed with their guest. Great location, price, service... Two thumbs up!! "
"The places is brand new, modern, simple and clean. I stayer in Cesar Costa Room. It has an amazing view. Staff is friendly and helpful. Had a great time here and defenitley come back agaian!  As a tip: go and visit Tulum Art Clubwhich is owned by same people. You will get 10% off in breakfast or drinks for being guest."
"What a great time we had! Great view, great service, near the beach...  it exceeded my expectations. Congrats to the staff, specially to the manager. I'm definitely repeating. The price is reasonable and the location is as centric as I anyone would expect. Thanks u guys! "
"Three words for you: GO THERE NOW  This place is amazing. It has just some kind of magic that is undescribable. You have to go there and experience to know what I mean. It goes a category beyond boutique, it's a hand-made experience  Of course nothing would be possible without Eduardo the GM who really made us feel at home in this hidden treasure in Tulum, away from the crowds of Cancun and Playa del Carmen and within the mystical Mayan ruins  Go there before TULUM gets massive crowds. With places like this"
"The best view, the best price and the beach just a few feet away.  The people are very kind and you have everything near, you don't need anything else.  All the hotels I search before were too expensive and they are not even close to this one. Beautiful architecture and 60's style decorations. Best pool in town. Believe me this is a must!"

"The expensive glass fronted entrance and the name Hemingway attracted us to this restaurant. How wrong it proved to be it is just a small beach cabana hotel with typical beach dining area prolific along this coast menu purporting to be Italian is as far removed from Italian cuisine as possible apart from pasta dishes. The lobster tostados was good, the lobster spaghetti was dreadful any Italian restaurant would serve this in a white sauce not a dreadful tomato based one overdone with onions! No definitely n"

"I couldn't recommend this place enough. The apartment was exactly like in the pictures - big, modern, clean and very lightly. We stayed for a week and we just couldn't get over the perfection of the flat and of the beautiful surroundings. The kitchen has everything you need, the shower is paradisiac and the terrace gave us the chance to relax in the warm breeze in the evenings. The owner and his family and all the staff at the hotel were amongst the nicest people we could meet - they were helpful, discreet "
We only spent a couple of days here but I could have stopped and put up permanent residence in this place. All of my time was spent lazing on the beach hammocks. With a view of the open sky and endless beach and a great little restaurant at the end of the bay. This was my all time favorite travel experience.
" beaches. Jaime (the owner) helped us find a local taxi driver (Danièl) to go visit the ruins - he was perfect, so much that we called him again for a second trip to Merida (the capital of Yucatàn). Everything was just perfect - will definitely go back! "
"First of all I want to say the photos of this place couldn't be more inaccurate, this place looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. The cabana that we were placed in first looked like a murder took place recently, when we inquired about this with the manager John Pierre, he proceeded to tell us Tulum has a ""Boho vibe"" and offered to move us to a different cabana because apparently they don't refund payments. During the middle of the night in our new cabana we had hotel staff outside our room yelling and"

"This place would be great for a family with a car or two couples sharing costs and bargain hunting or even a long term rental. It was beautiful,well designed, clean, and bright(except the  bathroom). The staff was extremely kind when i voiced my complaints and removed the charge of one nights stay that went unused.

 Tulum hotels allow this incredible owners to have this place open. I had booked it for 7 nights but after 2 nights I moved from other hotel with totally diferent quality and same price!

"My gf and I stayed here for a short trip and we had a great time! The staff is very accommodating and goes above and beyond to meet your needs! The beach location is great and very walkable to other restaurants and places to grab a drink. However, they serve delicious seafood dishes at the restaurant/bar located on site. The ceviche was awesome and Raymond makes the best margarita I have ever had!  Nothing but freshly squeezed lime juice, agave, etc!"
This is by far the worst hotel in Tulum and it’s not even close. The whole place is a dump. The owners don’t care about this place and it shows. Not a single bartender can make a cocktail. The absolute worst mojito I’ve ever had in my life. I got stomach pain from one sip. The day beds on beach and entire property are trash. And if it couldn’t get any worse they have a deranged untrained wild dog on their property that literally runs up on people on the beach and bites them. I’m not kidding and they don’t c
"We rented the private cabana right on the beach and it was amazing!  It’s a comfy king size bed with your own private bathroom. The front porch is nice to sit and watch the ocean. It had a roof top deck also for an even more amazing view!   The cabana is a bit rustic and not “air tight” so be aware of the possibility of bugs. The wind was nice and breezy when we were there, so there were none!  The only other thing to take note of is the water in the bathroom. Not sure of how they get water or filter it, bu"

You can only charge usb. Forget the laptop, the blow drier, the tv. (If needed you can charge laptops at their office) this place works on solar energy just as everyone here works on moon energy.

" to leave.   Please be aware that most hotels in Tulum are eco-chic. In Keniza this means only AC from 8pm-8am, which means you can’t cool off during the day or use any (heavy) electronics such as blow dryer and such. The rooms don’t have lockers, which some might find bothersome. "
" if you eat out few times a day. All essentials such as drinking water, coffee, salt and olive oil are stocked in advance. Moreover, the hotel offered complimentary bikes for guests, which made it very convenient to explore Tulum! All in all, excellent, I will return. "

" during our visit. A special mention must go to Christobal whose happy and professional demeanour marked him as a standout amongst the crew. We missed him when he left for a family visit part way through our stay. The fishing was challenging due to a prevailing and strong easterly wind throughout the week, which made fish spotting difficult for my aging eyes on many of the flats. However, our guide Gaspar worked tirelessly to find fish and get is in the right position for the best shots. I confess that my s"
"Thanks to Tayli, Luis, Mara, and Maria  for making my stay at Hotel Lychee so enjoyable!   I really appreciated your suggestions and conversations.    The rooms are spacious, and cleaned daily (thanks to Maria).  And,  most importantly in July,  the A/C cranks.  You guys are  muy amable!  Gracias!"
…
"We were very happy to stay here for five nights. Very friendly owners and on-site 24/7 staff. Best behaved dog ever (and as a long-time paperboy as a kid, I normally do not like dogs!). Free bicycles to use. Comfortable king-size beds. Access to a shared mini-fridge if you are in one of the cheaper rooms. The hammocks were very relaxing.   Only slight negatives: The Palmas Central food truck park next door often played loud music until 10 pm, making it hard to read (something that would not have bother us i"
…
"Do not stay here--we didnt even get to because our flights were cancelled due to weather. The hotel sold our room the night we were to arrive and they refused to give us even a partial refund. Every time my husband would call, they hung up on him. Dont give them your money! Ruined our 1 year anniversary."
"We booked Honeymoon Suite for 3 nights from March 7-10, 2019.  Communication from Lolita was superb prior to arrival.  Room is spacious and sliding door leads right to a little deck and amazing, fine white sand beach.  Outdoor shower perfect for washing sand off.  Bed is incredibly comfortable.  Room super clean.  Art is cool.  Location Location Location, Keniza is ideal location...you can head left and hit Be Tulum/Namaste for yoga and breakfast.  Nektar Juice/Coffee right across the street.  Killer trendy"
"We had a four day father-son fishing trip to GSL and highly endorse the professional operation in Punta Allen. The rooms are big and comfortable with very good air-conditioning. The food is fresh and well above average - especially the fresh guacamole after a long day on the water. Very healthy fishery with lots of bonefish & permit as well as Tarpon, Jacks, Snappers etc. Have never seen so many sea turtles which is a good sign of life in the waters. The guides work hard and the staff at the lodge are top n"
"This is a beautiful destination for your next trip to Tulum. When you arrive at the doors of Lychee Tulum, you are immediately greeted by a lovely, smiling face and a delightful foyer that opens onto a sweet collection of rooms and a refreshing pool. This hotel is intimate, comfortable, and safe. The rooms are fabulously decorated and there are beautiful plants everywhere! We loved to enjoy the daily breakfast before venturing out into the world, and loved even more when we came home to relax by the pool or"
" house so if you have a group of 6-8, book it, you will dig the deck overlooking the beach.  Bikes can be rented at Alaya next door for $10 per day.  We took bikes to Grand Cenote for a swim and hit Tulum proper for food after.  Great day trip.  There aren't many ""extras"" with your stay at Keniza but you're also not paying for it.  Hotels next door were going for 2x to 3x the price.  Crazy why people pay that much.  I'll be back at Keniza for sure, hopefully for longer stay this time!"
"Nice lodge, very friendly people, a very good fishing organization and beautiful beaches for people who don't fish I strongly reccomend it for families, people who love fishing (both spinning and fly fishing) and for people who just what to relax. A great experience!!!!!"
"Ideal location, quiet yet very close to all nice bars and restaurants (best seafood at Sabor de Mar just around the corner)!  The place has most helpful stuff and all you need for a nice stay - swimming pool, great breakfast served at your front door and quiet :)"
You won't be dissapionted with this small boutique hotel. Great working A/C and lots of hot water for showers with plenty of pressure. Rooms have a small fridge which is great for storing food. The staff were amazing Tali and Louis and Mara. They spoke perfect English had great places for us to visit. Great spots to have dinner they were simply amazing kind considerate and very knowledgeable. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to have a great stay.

"It is amazing. Great place, great people. Great value for money. Great location. You wont be disappointed! Super clean and very instagram-friendly 😆 The only thing is the bed could be a little bit comfier and the hot water is like hit and miss Definitely 5star: food, staff and facilities above the expectations! A must do: try the special wrap!"
"Fantastic fishing, fantastic people, confort and elegant rooms, .....everything perfect!  We fished both in the sea and in the lagoon. Tarpons, snook, Binfish, Barracuda, .......and many others.   I strongly recommend this fishing lodge for fly fishing , guides are very professionals and prepared to assist you."
"We loved staying at Kira's Beach House! Pros: -Area is great and you get to have your own private beach. Room 5 is the best because it's beach front and you get a balcony with two lounge chairs. The view is amazing! (We stayed in room 4) You get access to a kitchen and refrigerator. We went to the closest supermarket and bought coffee, creamer, and beer. -Lolita our host is super friendly and accessible at all times. We loved her! -This hotel doesn't have a bar that is staffed but the hotel next door does. "
"My wife and I stayed here for 5 days on the last leg of our honeymoon. Very relaxing location with amazing hosts, staff, and accommodation! She worked for a few of the days and the wifi was 10/10. Easy walking distance from the main strip. Highly recommend!!!"
"We did a short father-son fishing trip here, and were very happy with the lodge.  It is a small but well-run operation.  The on-site manager Miguel is friendly and helpful; Luis and Victor in the restaurant and bar do a great job, and our guide Oscar was hard working.   This is not a 5 star or luxury resort, but its comfortable, clean and everything you need for a low-key fly fishing week.  Good variety and number of bonefish, tarpon and schools of permit.  Guests were catching all of these while we were th"
"The hotel is in a beautiful location, very quiet and surrounded by trees. The pool is lovely and the cafe attached to the hotel makes getting breakfast very easy. You definitely need a bike to get around, as it's a good 20 min walk to town, and you can hire them for 100 pesos. I'm not a very confident bike rider, but found it easy to get around, as the Mexican drivers are quite polite.  Disliked · We arrived late due to problems with our taxi. I knew the code to get into the key safe, but we struggled a bit"

"We really enjoyed our stay with Alex in Tulum. The place was in the middle of a little jungle with a wonderful swimming pool, right place if you want to feel the nature and chill your self. The communication with Alex was great, I texted him few times for a few questions and he was always available for us.  Tulum has remained in our hearts and we will return as soon as possible and definitely to Alex."
This is a nice and cheap hotel. It works with a small manual wheelchair. Everything is just outside. The staff is very friendly and helpful.  There are two large beds in the room and you can easily be 4 in bed me room. 
Excellent service and great atmosphere! The pool and common space is beautiful. Units are spacious and have everything you need. We love it here. The cafe is great too. We will definitely be back :) best place to stay in Tulum!
"Loved the price, loved the apartment. It was big, very affordable and very easy to get to. Beforehand, I was very underwhelmed at another place I was staying which was double the price, smaller, and harder to get to. My only regret is not booking this place from the start of my trip. There is construction in the morning, and the shower handle is a little bit hard to handle but overall I loved the place. The pool is nice, we were the only ones there, they have a cute jungle area too."
"The hotel located in a perfect location in Tulum (small) city. However, if you want to go to the beach you have to take a taxi or rent a bike which is pretty long way to bike to the beach. The room is under standard for me. It's full of dust and cobweb. The bathroom is sort of dirty and very old and no amenities in the room. There is no restaurant in the hotel, so no breakfast served. "
"We had a great time at Aldea. Quiet, clean, with super WiFi for working. The pool area is amazing, full of trees, palapa, hammocks and a jacuzzi inside the pool, there is also a new Coffee Shop on-site with room service. We loved it and we are planning to come back."
"We love staying here! The rooms are clean and colorful and close to everything downtown Tulum! We have stayed here two years in a row & love the artwork, the location and the friendly staff! Tv & AC too! Good prices."
"This is a great place. Clean, comfortable and secure with good rates. AC and WiFi worked great. Location is central, everything you need is closeby. Prices are comparable to what you would pay at any midrange hostel, especially if there's more than one person in the room."
"We stayed for 2 weeks in Tulum and this was the best place. The outdoors are beautiful, the WiFi was excellent, up to 100mbps speeds so it was great for working and streaming. We really enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi, the bbq area and palapas. The new cafeteria is nice, they have good coffee and baguettes."
"The hotel was very much worth the price. We managed to get a room last minute during NYE and we got exactly what we paid for.   The rooms were clean, the wifi decently fast, the beds and pillows comfortable."
"Highly recommend this place, its good value for money as a traveller. In a perfect location. The room we had was MASSIVE, beds comfy and the aircon was good along with hot shower. Personally we loved 'Antonio' too! On reception he was a lovely guy, very helpful also and understanding of my need to watch a champions league football match stream on his reception computer too the legend! Would stay here again. 2 of our best friends are gettin married in some high end resort in Tulum next year and I've told the"
 (doing tiling work) didn't start until 8-9am and finished before 4-5pm. I'm sure there won't be any noise outside of low season as that's the time business to work and expand etc. 9/10 we loved it. Thanks again Antonio abs all the best amigo

"Stayed here much longer than we planned as really enjoyed the vibe in Tulum. Turned up without having booked a room and got the Coba room for 650MXN a night which we negotiated down for the additional nights. Room was clean and spacious with possibly the biggest flatscreen TV we have ever seen, although we didn’t use it. Only one day where there was no hot water, not sure what the problem was. Room cleaned everyday and the organic shampoo and soap were a lovely bonus. Bed was comfy and no real problems. You"
"I came here a few days and enjoyed the restaurant and the beach club. The owner, Omar, and the manager, Fernanda, are beyond excellent.   The decor of this place is so subtle, yet striking and the pool and beach club are just amazing to have food and enjoy the vibes at.  I had no complaints at all. I highly recommend this location - Claudio"
"I greatly enjoyed my stay at Casa Pueblo Tulum. The hotel is impeccably clean, stellar service, delicious food and conveniently located. You get access to the sister hotel on the beach as well so there are many perks to staying with them. I will be back next year!"
"We stayed at Casa Pueblo for a week starting march 6th, we came from Washington DC just before the pandemic. The hotel is modern and minimalistic. Service is top notch, staff really knows the meaning of hospitality, service is prompt and polite. Everyone from the servers to the room attendants to the front desk was superb. Special thanks to the pregnant lady at front desk, sorry I didn't get your name. There are just a couple of issues, namely lack of storage/shelves in the rooms, and the fact that the wind"
" beach property next time, where the staff was equally great (the servers were amazing)."
…
"We can’t say enough good things about our stay. After a few days at an all inclusive outside Cancun the Casa Pueblo was just what we needed - serenity. The staff was helpful and kind, especially when were feeling a little under the weather. Norna was the best!  We were tucked in the back so no real street noise but there was a low hum of club music til pretty late.  Food and juices were fab as was access to the beach hotels amenities!  We’ll be back! "
I hate leaving bad reviews especially since this hotel came so highly recommended. But the noise level was extremely high. One night they played loud music until 2 am. We switched rooms to avoid the loudness only to be hit with edm music until 6am the next day. We ordered a taxi through the hotel and were told a certain price only to be charged higher by the time we were brought to our destination. The staff is extremely sweet and accommodating and they will help make your stay better. Unfortunately due to 
"I dont typically write reviews but felt compelled to do so after my stay at Casa Pueblo. I had been admiring the hotel from instagram for a few months before I visited and it certainly lived up to the hype. The hotel is gorgeous (a photographer's dream) - super minimal so dont expect anything lavish in the rooms but its everything you need. The staff are all lovely - everyone from the servers at the restaurant, the cleaning ladies and the receptionists upon arrival - Violet and Norna were both so lovely and"
 nice to have as an option.   The hotel can be a bit noisy since you are in  town so if city noise bothers you i would bring ear plugs. The power did go out one morning which was not ideal but again that was a city issue and out of the hotel's control.  I was dying for coffee that morning so they ended up making me a special Mexican version on the stove stop which was so nice!
…
"I would choose this place over a hotel any day! It is large and spacious, but nicely enclosed and cool. Tons of space to string up a hammock and enjoy the shade. Abundant washrooms and showers and public spaces. We loved our three-night stay here, met some interesting people, and found the bikes and breakfasts super convenient. There are drums and instruments and colorful artwork everywhere which all contribute to the vibrant hippie vibe of the place."
"I stayed in Casa del Sol with two friends and we had a real good time. Good advices from the managers and the place is real nice. Fresh fruits and « crêpes » for breakfast, a nice roof where to smoke... the place has it all. Go Casa del Sol."
"While Casa Del Sol may not be the Four Seasons, it has everything you need for a fuss free stay. The breakfast is delicious and it’s in a quiet but still central part of Tulum. What makes this Hostel special however, are the people. The receptionist in particular, is one of the nicest and most helpful and accommodating people we’ve met in Mexico. If you’re looking for top-tier luxury, look elsewhere. But if you want somewhere relaxed, affordable, unpretentious and with bikes to rent - head here."
"The two words I would use to describe my stay at Casa Del Sol - disappointing and weird. We stayed for 4 nights during December of 2018.  The hostel is not as advertised - what looks like a regular building is actually a semi constructed asphalt structure that is in disrepair. We stayed in an upstairs bungalow, and for the duration of the stay the Women’s bathrooms were almost always without soap or toilet paper. A “fixer upper hostel” would have been OK on its own, but staying here feels like being an unwe"
" BLASTING music and drumming that began at 7 am in the morning, and went late into the night, every single night. While the breakfast was good, the kitchen was filthy and not fit for preparing food, and we also left with hundreds of bug bites, unsure as to whether or not that is par for the course in Tulum.  I have stayed at many hostels in my time and this was one of the worst. Do yourself and favour and spend your time and money somewhere else."
…
"They mean well but it’s not a professional operation. There is stuff everywhere and some of the gas and water arrangements are downright dangerous. Something bad will happen sooner or later.   I stayed in a 6 bed ensuite which had air con   It was so cold I had to wear my fleece in bed as well as a blanket but they didn’t do anything to try to make things better. They had sole control of the controller. The owner said something about it was a luxury and still people complained. Well, yes they will with that"
"We stayed here for four nights and were initially taken aback at how different the hostel looked from their photos. The overall colour of the hostel is dark and brown, mainly concrete based. That being said, we had a good time here. We were really thankful to utilise the free bikes in the day and complimentary breakfast. The size of the hostel is large with plenty of room to do either social or be by yourself. The WIFI is strong in the communal too. The bathroom and showers were not exactly the best or wors"
"Stayed in a private room. The concept of this hostel is so cool, wooden huts in what probably was only destined to be a multiplex car park.   Eric was great in showing us around, free bike hire and a great breakfast in the morning.   Would highly recommend! "
I stayed 3 nights here in private room with shared bathroom. The room is spacious and the price is very affordable and it includes breakfast. They give some variety with the breakfast in different days. They also provide free bicycle use which makes it so easy to explore Tulum. I used the bike twice to explore the cenotes and to go to the beach. I really like the design of the hostel with wooden materials and nature/village look. The owner Eric and his uncle are very cool people. They're very friendly and h
"Initially was very happy with this hostel however when we checked in we asked to extend our stay a second night which was approved. They didn't ask for immediate payment so we asked if we could pay our second night the following day. We repeatedly confirmed this as correct and they said 'yes,yes,yes'... not the case. We got back from a day of activities to find our bed stripped, all of our belongings moved around and a string of nasty emails stating we hadn't checked out. They repeatedly blamed us for this "
"Really couldn't fault this accommodation, and was probably the best place we stayed (for a good price) throughout the whole of Mexico! The private rooms were exactly what we wanted, with private bathroom, fridge, towels and free water all at a reasonable price.  The staff working there were great, and location was slightly out of the centre but within walking distance of the main strip.   Although the hostel was great, we wouldn't go back to Tulum as there is next to nothing to do, and far nicer places arou"
"Nicely located, only 3 blocks from the main street, but far enough to not hear crazy loud music all night. This was great! Convenient.   This property is set up like a hostel with about 8-9 private rooms and a small garden.  There was someone on the property all the time, it felt secure, and there was a bottle water refill area. Staff did not speak English, which was ok with us. There was a safe in the room, and of unlike the past reviewer who had been robbed, we used it. I recommend you always do, of cours"
" close however. The kitchenette was really nice to have, we were able to keep our drinks/waters cold and there was a small one burner stove with some dishes, as well as a fold out table and chairs.   All in all for the price, you get a pretty good value with this place. Oxxo is across the street.   Tip - this is not on/near Tulum beach, you need to take a 130 Peso taxi to get there as it's not close enough to walk to. Beach is closer to the end of town the hostel is on, so no need to walk far down the main "
"Large rooms looking over a pretty, grassy courtyard right near the center of town. They rent bikes. There are many restaurants and juice bars within walking distance. Bed was comfortable. Some noise from next door restaurant prior 6pm--8pm, but otherwise quiet. Cheaper than staying right on the beach....front dest folks speak good english."
…
"I stayed there for a week and could stay there for longer if they wouldn't rase the room price. The hotel located in the best area in town, the rooms r big, with a kitchen well equipped. The stuff that work there is so very nice and helpful and there is a great energies there. I stayed in room 25, which is my favorite room (he has a little balcony to the Main Street), but it can be a little bit noisy in weekend night. There r more quite rooms in the hotel.  The only problem I had was that the cleaning isn't"
"I stayed in Tulum Naa one night, and wanted to stay longer but money was taken from my private room (which was locked) while I went out to take a quick breakfast. That same morning, other guests were missing money too. The owner is extremely manipulative and dishonest. All my other experiences in Mexico were great, but this guys is just so unpleasant - that is why I do not recommend this place."
"Very friendly and chilled vibe. Hopefully they will do more work on the terrace. I stayed in a private room with a friend and the room was spacious but a bit sticky. Possibly because the only small windows could not be opened. Room and enclosed bathroom as well as common areas were spotless clean. The original price was too expensive for room and location, but we could bargain it down forgoing breakfast. What I did not like is that on the last night I asked about our deposit as we would leave town with the "
"We stayed here for three nights whilst visiting the sights around Tulum.  It's a really good little hotel, we had a high room which was spacious and clean. We didn't use the kitchen for cooking but it was adequate for budget travelling!  The wifi worked really well inside our room for one day but otherwise we had to use the courtyard which is shaded for most of the morning. Our air conditioning worked great and the bathroom was fine!  We rented bikes for a day which cost 60 pesos as we were guests of the ho"
"The room was dated and the bathroom sink leaked so flooding the bathroom. It's way over priced for what you get.  The lady on reception in the mornings was not helpful at all.  She kept giving incorrect information.  However,  the man on reception in the evening was very polite and knowledgeable. "
"I stayed 3 nights here & had an absolutely comfortable stay. First, my bus from Belize City arrived at 4am so they were able to receive me & check me into my room at that time.  By then, I was in need of sleep so was glad when I saw my room.  It was big, very clean, and the bed was comfortable.  There was also an AC and fan, much needed to cool off from Tulum's heat.  The bathroom, which was nice & clean, also had an overhead fan.  The room has a big space with a refrigerator, a sink, and dishes.  There are"
" option as the dorms are separated from the common area and entrance only by bamboo sticks, no walls... Which is why I would never stay in a dorm there..."
"we had a great stay at Hotel Vera Sol. The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The room was awesome for the price we paid. we had 2 room, one with a full kitchen, fridge, microwave and then the bedroom. will deff stay there again!"
"We had a great stay at Hotel Vera Sol! It was very clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful, and it was close to all amenities and attractions. Bike rentals were an added bonus! Having baked goods, fruit, and coffee was a nice touch in the mornings also. "
" location, on a street lined with several restaurants.  Right next door is Azafran, a great place for breakfast / brunch / lunch.  There's also an OXXO convenient store across the street.  It's close to the main street where there are several more restaurants & stalls selling souvenirs, crafts, etc..  There's also a bank at this corner.  This main street is where you can catch the bus to the Tulum Ruins, which is only a 10min ride away."
…
"Everything was really good. We enjoyed our stay! Clean, freindly staff and close everywhere. Good location on the main street. What can I say more, I will for sure come back again to Vera Sol. If You looking for a budget place there is nothing bad I can say about this hotel."
…
"When my boyfriend and I’ve got in the hostel, the guy in the reception sad it was included a continental breakfast, but in the next morning that was just 2 slices of bread, hot water. We stayed in the hostel for 2 nights and we had a bus to catch in the end of the 3rd day. We asked if it was possible to let out luggage there and have a shower after the checkout. The manager sad there was cameras in the place and for that reason they need to charge for that even the place was empty. We accept but when we are"
"We had the pleasure of visiting Vera Sol. Location is perfect, room was spotless, hot showers, bike rentals, great friendly service. We biked to the beach today, twenty minute bike ride was beautiful. Visited the shops and restaurants. No complaints, room was clean, spacious, AC worked great! Safe and quiet. Wish we could stay longer!"
"We were quite happy with Vera Sol, if for no other reason than that it provided super-strong A/C for good value in steamy Tulum. The staff was exceptionally friendly and the room was really big... and kind of a strange mix, where we had a stove and sink but no fridge or utensils. Odd, but unimportant. Half of the lights and the ceiling fans didn't seem to work either, but overall, we were happy to have a frosty cool room and comfortable bed. Very quiet at night, even though it was on the main road.  Obvious"
"stayed here for four nights and after being out all day adventuring in the heat this was the perfect place to return to. perfect AC, comfy bed, cleaned daily and a chilled little hammock spot right out in front. the crew that works there are really nice. good location near the famous 25 peso vegetarians nightmare street burger. recommended"
"The price was very good and the location was perfect, they offer free bikes but we had our car already, rooms are clean and the washroom is clean, beds are small , we like the stay and it was a good experience "
"I think this was the worst breakfast I´ve ever had, 2 slices of bread with jam and butter and bad coffee. The girl who cleans was constantly following me turning off the lights and fan, which I thought not nice since it was super hot and also pretty dark on the dormitory. The key of the front door downstairs was not working properly and once I had to wake up the manager keta to open it, she was rather rude. I think more love would be necessary in this hotel. The positive thing was location, it is in the mai"
"We loved our stay at Vera Sol. A budget friendly hotel with a great location in town. Only five minutes taxiride to the beach, or 15 min with bike (that you can rent at the hotel). The rooms were simple but big, and included cable-TV, A-C, fans and a small kitchen with fridge. Don't trust the old rewievs, the new management started in august. Very friendly  and helpfull staff:)"
"We really enjoyed our stay in the ContainME Eco Chic Hotel. The containers themselves are really well thought out and comfortable. There is a surprising amount of space for two people w luggage, the air conditioning worked really well, and they were equipped with screens to prevent mosquito invasions! The bathroom was nice too, with an excellent shower! Don’t get too drawn in by the name “chic hotel” though. This is not a hotel and more a simple accomodation. Also, heads up, it is a 15-20min walk to the mai"
"We stayed here in a private room for 5 nights and loved it.  Great a/c, hot water, room is cleaned every day, breakfast included and close to the main street.  Staff are very laid back but also available and helpful.  They also speak English which is a bonus if you want local advice and the breakfast is more substantial than many. The bar is almost open as well with normal price drinks and good music  but is not a party hostel.  Thanks for a great stay. "
"After a shaky start (we arrived very late at night and spent the first day in dorms) we found the MayaYoga hostel to be a pleasant, affordable and well located option for overpriced Tulum.  You are opposite the nicest road for food in town.  The family room was really large and just fine for a 4 night stay. The kids loved the bamboo bunk beds. The guys at the hostel did all they could to accommodate our family while we were there.  Tulum is a hard pace to leave.  Enjoy your stay."
"When we arrived we thought it looks really nice and cool. But after we got the room, we had to tell the guy that we need two towels (2 persons) and the WIFI password. He wasn't helpful and showed us the hostel at all. Than the water missed 2-3 times in the whole hostel, dirty bathroom (full of hair), broken shower head. Also our toilet leaked and everything was full of water. I know this happens sometimes but they called two times the plumber and it wasn't fixed. Anyway on the last day we came home from the"
" or most comfortable. There are a number of bike rental places in town and if you want to explore by bike, it might pay to investigate these. The staff were friendly and very patient with me and my patchy Spanish, always willing to humour me as I attempted to explain what we had done that day. "
…
"I did enjoy Tulum as it's a city that'll make most feel at ease and you just want to take your time to just do you. That's for the city this hostel is located at. La Malinche is a creat hostal with the friendliest staff you'll find. All under guiding sight of the man that will make your stay worth your while: Gustavo, man of the hour. Hear hear!"
" passport and cash in it without waiting there!!!!!! This time we were lucky but you never know.... We were so upset and angry because we tried to speak with the managerin of the hostel. But she didn't really care and we demand a partial refund of the price. But we ""talked"" about the translator on the phone half an hour and finally they gave us ridiculously 200 pesos back from the 2100 for 3 nights. Also the breakfast were two slices toast, jam and butter. I really cannot recommend the hostel. They don't kn"
We stayed here for three nights and our dust bin was never emtied. There is only salt water for the shower and the tap altough there a waterbottles provided. When it rains it is very loud because of the metal roof and in our Container #4 it was even leaking. Everthing else was ok and Juan Carlo did the best he could. The hostel is located aprox. 20 min. walk from ADO bus-Station. With a Taxi 30MXP. The best next Restaurant is El Camello.
"Great hostel with amazing food and social vibe.  I stayed for almost 5 weeks. It's right near the main Street, but not in it so not too loud.  There's lots of great street food nearby and the restaurant is really nice too."
One my favourite hostel in the world staff are amzing especially Gustavo and make u feel at home location is great and close to town and the best street food in tulum ..I highly recommend this place if u go to tulum
…
Great hostel with friendly staff and quiet mellow vibes. No yoga is offered as mentioned in some of the advertising but there is still space for you to do yoga at your own free will. There is also a natural juice bar and bike rental just below.
"Nice pool area and studio was equipped with coffee and water, which was appreciated.  King bed was large and comfortable.  However, getting to the place over the potholed roads was a challenge, especially after rain.  The location is away from the centre, which should have meant it was quiet, but as it backs on to other properties, you will get a lot of noise if others come home at 4 am and decide to have an impromptu party (as happened to us).

"For everyone who says they should update this place, they literally were as we stayed there. Electricity was on all day as their are renovating, changed the name/sign to La Diosa, adding hot water heaters and doubling the price.  We stayed here because it was the cheapest place on the beach and we knew what we were getting into. We called it  'glamping' to get the kids in the right mindset. We loved the location and had everything we needed-bed, dry place to keep our stuff, bathrooms and free parking. The r"

"We loved Casa Chachalaca.  We were stoked when we got there, because our  accommodation in Tulum last year was super sketchy.  This place is beautiful--extremely clean and everything looks practically brand new.  The people that took care of us were super friendly as well, and helped us arrange a bunch of activities including kiting, paddleboarding, and a cenote.  They also gave us good tips on restaurants and beach clubs.   Loved hanging out in the garden spotting tropical birds--including a Toucan!"

"They guy at their beach club tried to scam me for $100, he put a green band on my wrist and claimed that because I tore it off I was required to pay him 2000 pesos in cash only. I was there for less than five minutes, and was going to leave when I found out they don’t accept cards, that’s when this guy physically grabbed me and threatened to keep my phone and belongings. He only left me alone once I got my Mexican husband on the phone and he figured out his scam wasn’t going to work.   He put the band on my"
"Place to avoid.  We found hairs in beds, bed covers dirty,  kitchen with really old equipment not to use, broken cups, skretched pan, living room smells of moisture and fungus, shower with cold water!  In reality nothing looks like on pictures they present. We booked for 7 days but after one night we decided to move out. For one stinking night owner charged us over 400 eu. It was penalty for booking cancelation but in fact I never had so terrible accomodation in any place ! I could understand to pay one nig"

"We had a great stay at Casa Chachalaca.  The rooms were very clean- all construction is new and in good working order.  The hosts are very friendly and accommodating, and were eager to answer questions and give us advice on places to eat and local activities.  The pricing is very reasonable.  Overall, it was a great trip!"
"You cannot go wrong with a hotel right on the great Paraiso beach (beach: long and narrow, not crowded, non-scratchy sand, warm azure clean water). I repeat - HOTEL ON THE BEACH! Can't beat such an ideal location. 24/7 beach access + the archeological ruins and a fun outdoorsy shopping area within walking distance. Staff had varying levels of English (some none at all) but were generally friendly and helpful. Restaurant Coral Azul, attached to the hotel, has really nice, good food, but they close around 8 p"
"Just stayed in the apartment with my family and friends. We had really good time at Casa Chachalaca. The place was clean, bed sheets changed every 2-3 days, nicely situated and surrounded by jungle. Good location if you planning trips to Coba and Chitchen Itza. Very quiet, walking distance to centre of the Tulum. Owners are very nice and helpful. They also run 'extreme control' kite surf school, I can recommend puddle boarding and kite boarding adventure as I experienced both.  Staying at Casa Chachalaca we"
 appreciated as I did not have to spend time searching for bike rentals.
"Really glad I stayed here. Nice apartment, beautiful garden, cool dogs. What more could you wish for?! The bed was supra comfy. Check-in was great despite my fairly late arrival.The owners are super nice and they emphasize being eco-friendly and keeping Tulum clean, which is great!"
…
"My fiancee and I were passing through Tulum, and I booked the larger of the two rooms at Casa Chachalaca just before we left Cancun. We both really liked this place, and ended up staying a second night. As someone else mentioned, this is a few minutes driving south of the Tulum main strip, and in my estimation a bit far to walkv to the beach. If you have a car, this place is perfect, and if not, you can take advantage of the cheap taxi services offered. We actually preferred staying more in a jungle setting"
"Zazil Kin is definitely the most affordable option on the Paraiso beach (without opting for tents) with the best beach spot. We spent 4 days there and went for the basic cabanas that have a private loo, shower and sink (only cold water FYI) with a surprisingly comfortable bed and a minimal fan.  If you’re looking for luxury accommodation, this is not for you. But if you’re looking for a place where you can spend all day on the beach and just use your room to sleep in, this is perfect.  As it is one of the l"
" We rented the latter, as it has a balcony, which we liked. The owners/hosts live at the top level, but the rental units are very private. There is a kitchen, as well as a spacious living room area. My gf is a chef, and if we were not just travelling through, we would probably have used the kitchen at least on some nights. We only got to meet Marco, Heather was travelling. Marco was an excellent host, available if we needed advice. The do offer several activities, from kiteboarding classes to eco trips, but"

"Just stayed at this lovely apartment with my brother and his wife. Decor is just right, apartment is both clean and comfortable. You need a car, it's 5 mins drive from Tulum and just a bit to far to regularly walk (and too far to get to beach and local sites), that said you can hire bicycles and local taxis are relatively inexpensive. Seen other reviews and it might be hot in the apartment mid summer, but this time of year it's very comfortable. I enjoyed the dogs and cats, although if your are not a fan th"
"We had a great time during our vacation in Tulum. The owners Marco and Heather were really helpful and super friendly. The apartment was spacious and clean and in a quiet and safe area. The furnishing and decoration was really pretty and we had everything neccessary for cooking and living. During our one week stay, the towels and bed sheets have been changed twice. Even drinking water and toilet paper have been provided.   Marco and Heather lead a dive and surf shop. People, who are interested can book cour"
The place was amazingly beautiful and the lodge was clean and well equipped. This is perfect place if you searching for a quiet and relaxed place in the middle of the jungle. And there was a great yoga hut. The hosts were really helpfull and nice.
"Spacious unique villa in the jungle. We really had a great time there. It was a magical secret place to escape from crowded Tulum. There is a kitchen to do some basic cooking and we had a terrace to relax after a long day. The pool is great to cool down and hang around. The road to the lodge is bumpy and can be muddy after rain, so we were lucky that we rented a big car.  The roof of our villa was leaking which was taken care of the same day as we informed the owner about  this. Would be a great if the kitc"
 in the jungle.  It is a place surrounded by dreamcatchers and positive words. My girlfriend loved it and was taking pictures of every cute corner 😆. Because of the remote location it attracts people who enjoy different forms of meditation. We had people spacing out hugging trees and singing in the middle of the night. 
"I visited Aqua Viva last year at this time as well.   The warm, welcoming, slightly eccentric vibe here is the reason I will keep coming back.   April offers a slower and more chill pace in Tulum which allows you to get to know the locals.   Giorgio the owner of Aqua Viva and his staff are wonderful at making you feel at home in his gorgeously designed hotel. He has great insight into where the best restaurants (Humo is a MUST and is attached to the hotel and vegan friendly), beaches, and sights to experien"
 are everywhere along the one main road in town so it is easy to navigate your way around.   I was fortunate to be able to stay in a few rooms on different nights which all offer huge beds with high quality linens. The bathrooms are STUNNING in design. All the rooms open to a central pool that is breathtaking and always seems to be the perfect temperature. For anyone looking for an instagram worthy spot this is the place.   No TVs but if you need a TV in a place like this there is something wrong with you.

Cancelled my 3 month old booking less than 24 hours before !!! AND WITH NO REASON NOR EXCUSE   Had to find another hotel at last moment with higher price.   DON’T GO THERE ! Totally unprofessionnal and not reachable  If you book there you like gambling
"Hotel was very good and nice. Pools area was great also, many pools and lots of activities for everybody. Rooms are nice, big and clean. Allinclusive foods was good. Kids like the deserts very much.  Waterpark next to the hotel was great also. Slides for adults snd small kids."
"Loved it here, after a couple of weeks of traveling Mexico & Belize this was a lovely chilled final few days before we flew home. The beds are so comfy!   Booked through Booking.com where the pictures showed a partially open bathroom so we stayed in a standard room the first night and the next morning I said to Jose that we were under the impression we were staying in a different room and straight away he moved us to the room we thought we were staying in for no extra cost.  Lovely pool steps away from your"

I absolutely loved staying at Aquaviva! So much that ended up flying back within a week to spend 10 days with my brother as we were looking for a place to relax and feel at home. The location is perfect and the whole team is very helpful Jose the manager will go The extra mile to make you feel comfortable and facilitate your time in Tulum. 
I booked this place via booking.com which resulted in a big disappointment. The reviews where quite nice but the horrible service ruined our experience there. We arrived at a closed gate and had to ring a bell to get in (including waiting time). The neighbourhood is also not very nice and you need to walk on a gravel road to get to the high way and then 800 more meters to the bus station of tulum (quite outside the city). I’ve booked the cheapest room which resulted in a chamber where you couldn’t even fit 
Ciel Rose has the best sunset rooftop! If you want a cool vibes place with awesome drinks and a killer sunset view this is your spot! The owner Guillaume and his staff are very friendly and accommodating. Service is fantastic! We hit this spot almost every night for sunset. The have a menu with food as well and hooka. A must go to spot for your Tulum visit!
"This place is an absolute hidden gem!  It is by far the best sunset spot in Tulum with great food, drinks and music.  The owner Guillaume (gee yaam) is a great guy too!   Kind of hidden off the Main Street but easy to find if you just ask someone.   "
"We fell in love with this place and the people who work there.  We ended up eating here several times, and enjoying the sky bar for a couple evenings.  The food is delicious, the atmosphere will absolutely charm you, and the small staff will take care of you like family. (Thank you Flo, Susana, Angelica)  On our first visit, Flo took care of us, and when he noticed me swatting a mosquito he immediately delivered insect repellent to the table without me even asking.  That really showed attention to detail an"
 BE mosquitoes.  We learned to always have insect repellent.

We loved this funky hotel - traveled with my 3 college age kids to Tulum. Ciel Rose is a hip beach cafe/ bar on jungle side of road with rooms in back - we had the treehouse double palapa - large comfortable room in a great location. Flo the manager was so nice and fun. If you want glamour not your place....if funky loft like room in a jungle with cool hippy funky vibe - you will love. We did!
"The property is incredible! Ocean view, pool view and garden view in one, daily cleaning service and super nice and available concierge Andrea. It´s only 10 away from Tulum, where all the bars and restaurants are. Hardly recommended."
"I stayed here Sept 18-22nd of September.  I saw the pictures and thought it would be an exceptional place to rent for my bday.  When we arrived we noticed that it's located in rare area, which was ok.  When we entered the Villa, it was beautiful just like the photos, but later on things started to change.  First, our entire stay we didn't have hot water.  Now I paid almost $10,000 and we didn't have hot water.  None of the rooms had hot water.  Secondly, while we were cooking, a huge rat came in the kitchen"
" done.  Besides the rat, no hot water and no televisions, the Villa was great."
…
The hotel is one of the most beautiful spots I've ever seen! All rooms are awesome and perfectly designed. Rebecca was the perfect host and helped us whenever we needed her. Next to that they offer a delicious breakfast every morning! I would return to this beautiful paradise at any time!
"We stayed for 2 nights in a private room above the pool.  The bed was very good but very noisy from the busy street leading to town. We were told there is never hot water for showers, and the breakfast consisted of 1 pancake, half an orange and 1/4 banana and a good cup of coffee. A bit small and basic.  The staff was very friendly but it definitely didn't meet our expectations. We stayed out of town (it's also far from the beach) so we could sleep in a quiet place but I didn't sleep well at all because of "
"Stayed here for four nights at the end of a 5-month trip through south and central america. Stayed in a double room which was great and had good aircon, and the outdoor area was nice too. A couple of glaring issues though:  It's a good 30 minute walk into town, and a 20 min plus walk to the beach, and is located by a huge main road in a total no-mans land that ends up being the worst of both worlds!  Also (and this isn't advertised anywhere until you've arrived and checked in) alcohol is completely banned o"
" final thing- on our last evening we got in at 22:15 to find the gates locked & unopenable and no-one at reception. It took about 20 minutes of shouting and banging until we were finally allowed in by non-apologetic staff.  In summary- good facilities, rooms and pool, but bad location, slightly unfriendly atmosphere and bizarre prohibition which means I'm unlikely to recommend!"
…
"The place is different from the picture. We had 2 separates rooms : towels, bed sheets and matress were not clean. Procès during new year and january are excessively overpriced. The place clearly need to be refreshed. The food menu need to be reviewed - lack of taste. It is better to propose mexican food than trying to cook european dishes.   Besides all of this the people working there were nice. "
"The initial impression was lovely, but that's only on the surface.  The place is filthy, the toilet was broken,  they only allow ac after 8pm, the beds are rock hard, you have to pay to use the sheets & the staff walk around smoking all day. They only take pesos and most of the machines in the area are broken.  Our son became violently I'll after one night and they demanded we pay for all 4 nights of our booking before allowing us to take him to the clinic when though that isn't stated anywhere in their pol"
Very loud music all day bad laundry service and in general bad service The hostel is very far from the city and the over priced taxi don't help The party was not fun If you want to enjoy your time in tullum it's not the place for you
"It's sad to give this hostel such a bad rating of only two stars (Great place and location, friendly volunteers) but...!  All in all I stayed about five nights, with a break of 1 night because I was kicked out by the system, which works a such: Lobo Inn doesn't care if guests which already stay at the hostel wish to stay longer. All beds are available over internet. I didn't pay early enough because I didn't have 180 Pesos at hand, but only Dollars and a credit card, which both they don't accept. The hostel"
"Having arrived here from an upmarket All Inclusive Riviera Resort, our group of 5 were a little dubious about a stay at the Lucky Traveler Hostel.  However, based on it's super close proximity to the Tulum Ruins (like, across the street!) and the fact that it is advertised as the only All Inclusive Hostel in the World, our booking was quickly secured.  Two days before our arrival we received a message to advise of a name change to the Lucky Traveler PARTY Hostel and they certainly did not disappoint in this"
" ensuring our constant hydration via a steady stream of Pina Coladas while we waited.    The town itself is filled with perfect little eateries and bars, as well as some vibey clubs that stay open past sunrise.  Also, do yourself a favour and get to Batey's to watch funky live bands (like Buena Chaplin) and drink fresh-pressed sugar cane mixed with your choice of booze.  All in all, your time here will be what you make it, and we were fortunate enough to spend time with some awesome locals who took us under"
" was not allowed by the manager. So I had to ask the hostel just over the street (There, without any problem). Another mayor hassle is the bike policy. Lobo Inn lends free bikes (Which is great), but for guests who leave the bikes are no more available the day they depart, even when check out is at 11am, neither are they available after 0.30am. Also other people complained about this rules. To me the manager isn't easygoing and relaxed."
…
…
"The place is nice for a few nights, has plenty of available services like included bikes and a pristine pool. The breakfast could be a little better but its not that bad. I had an unpleasant experience with the staff manager when they randomly tested several keys on peoples lockers and got mine open and dived into my documents to then blame me for a lock they lost, compromising my credit cards and personal info, etc. The rest of the staff was friendly and helpful but the manager was rude and unprofessional "
" beach in like 10 minutes. The place holds a nice vibe and has everything you need for a barbecue. All and all, its a good option if you are on a budget and are interested in nature-like spots for your trip."
"The Lucky Traveler is honeslty one of the best hostels I have ever stayed in. I first travelled there solo for a week at the begining of Novemebr and then visited two more times throughout the month. The energy here is magical, there is always sweet tunes playing and a nice buzz about the communal areas.  The staff are incredible, super friendly and welcoming. Reyes and the kitchen staff make the most delicious food with a great selection to choose from you wont be disappointed.  Alex, Eddson and Marco are "
"These apartments are very pretty and as pictured, however we paid over 350/night and we were only given one clean towel during our stay and there is no where to do your own laundry.  I realize these are apartments, but for people traveling by plane, it would be nice to have this basic amenity. On top of that, the manager, whoever I was communicating with on Whatsapp, was INCREDIBLY rude and combative. We were told to pay 50% deposit and 50% once we were at the location. We were greeted by host late at night"
" and maja made my stay unforgetable! Not only are all the staff awesome, the travellers I met at the Lucky traveller hostel were all so kind and friendly.  It is a really special place and I can not wait to get back there soon!"
" reservation will be terminated if they don't receive immediate payment. OF course, we were planning to pay, but the combative nature that they took to get my payment (this was on going conversation, and they just made things worse) left a terrible taste in my mouth. If payment is due upon check-in, they simply have to notify us AT CHECK IN. Or provide written expectations. They are poorly organized, and I have stayed in many places all over the world and this was just very disappointing. The restaurant was"

"I am really thankful for having reserved with Salvador and Tere. We had been a last minute problem during our trip, one of us was sick and we had to come back by emergency in our country. They were really comprehensive and accommodative. They fully refund us and for sure knowing how they are as human beings, I would recommend them and will come back at their place."

"We came to Tuolumne for a birthday party with a few friends and the staff was incredibly accommodating, the rooms were a great deal for the price, and everything we needed was easily accessible. The hotel itself is beautiful with a pool that we always had to ourselves and the staff was always happy to help us with what to do and who to call for a taxi. Would absolutely recommend, it is about a 15 minute drive to the beach and about a five-minute drive into downtown Tulum."
"Booked  a room x 3 nights all inclusive!!! Pictures on website were excellent they show nice rooms , nice pool great outdoor and amazing food display,,, but reality hits when we tried to find the place took us 30 minutes trying to find how to get there , no parking, outdoors appearance terrible,  moldy swimming pool out of order , room lights where lo working bathroom floor wet from a licking sink, and thirty , round chemeny in center of the patio full of garbage, and construcciones debris all over request "
"This place was great, very modern decor, very clean rooms and kitchen etc. All the utensils you could need. Transport arranged for you if you pay extra and the driver is very friendly and on time, for sure worth the extra.  location is excellent and The pool is great too! we will be going back one day! thanks mi tulum for the vacation dreams :)"
It’s our first night at Arthouse so we went to check out Norid (Restaurant on Site). Our server Marco was incredible and made sure we were always taken care of. Such a great welcoming night and amazing food & drinks. Thanks Marco! PS Tuna (first) is a win
"Due to Hurricane Delta, we booked a last minute same day reservation since Cancun was evacuated. This was a wonderful place to weather the storm. My family felt secure and safe through the night. Even though, the owners had their own Hurricane preparations they went out of their way for us, including letting us use their garage to protect the rental car.  This is boutique with six apts.  Very quaint, but modern touches away from the glitzy high rises.  The rooftop terrace has amazing views of the surroundin"

"This should be a great restaurant but without doubt one of the most comical experiences I've ever had.  They had 1 option for red wine, great if you wanted a glass of vinegar, $5 in the supermarket, $45 here!  But the most incredible moment is when my main course arrived before the starter!  And, the waiter didn't seem to understand the problem!  The pasta starter wasn't bad, when it eventually turned up.  The chicken main was sent back for a second time, and on this occasion because it was rare.  Some peop"
"It must be said that it is very beautiful property beyond that it’s not worth going there. 1/It’s very far and during our 5 day stay we paid each way 20$usd to go anywhere. 2/ The stuff is not very helpful, anything you ask them, they basically ignore. Our Tv not working, the lights are broken and we can’t see the key hole even open during the day. Forget about asking them for recommendations or suggestions. 3/ we had to keep our beach towels for 5days as well as our bath towels in a hot environment like Me"

"I'm pretty sure Luna Maya has now changed its name to Tulum Bay Hotel. We stayed there recently and were very impressed.   PROS: - Great location! Right on the beach and across the road from restaurants (Mateos is great) and a few stores. - A fantastic ocean lookout and a beautiful, well thought out setting (lots of trees, hammocks, banana lounges etc). - Rooms were clean and well maintained. Lots of nice touches like towel sculptures and a bowl of water to wash your feet in. - Staff were friendly and helpf"

"When I came into Casa Macarena by a friend's advice I was expecting nothing but the best. And it surpassed my expectations,  it literally felt like home and was the perfect combination of joint areas and privacy. Not to mention the amazing staff in the premises that were just wonderful - specially Guillermo who made me feel at home since day one. He even cooked an amazing stake one day! 10/10 will recommend."
 and was impressed to see many of the recommendations people made had been acted upon. The restaurant was closed while we stayed but due to reopen soon.
The only good thing is the property is beautiful but beyond that nothing. Actually after experience it makes it not so beautiful.   Not even sure how they got a certificate of excellence. It’s unbelievable.   This is by far the worse place we’ve had ever experienced & aren’t the only ones as the only either guest we saw while there said the same things. This is off season so place isn’t even full & they forget to tell you that their website along with all others they are posted on that no shuttle to beach e
"Stayed there with my wife on a weekend getaway trip. Well located in downtown Tulum, (walking distance to Aguachiles restaurant) fantastic suites (very spacious), great staff and had free access to Tata Tulum beach club.  They provide bikes to ride to the beach, great experience!  Highly recommended!"

"Luna Maya was our top pick for our destination wedding. We contacted them about renting the entire hotel for three nights, and set the dates with Marielena, who works the front office. After we decided who would stay in which room, she emailed all of our guests to let them know the reservation/payment procedures. We then proceeded to print our invitations. A few days later our invitations arrived in the mail, and I spent the afternoon preparing them for mailing. That evening, we received an email from Marie"
 rude the personal that works and manages the place by checking the answers on this thread of reviews. It’s like this from check in to check out. Record & take photos of everything if you do to stay to cover your behind but also as proof.  They completely forgot who is paying for a service and how to give just good CUSTOMER SERVICE.  One example is at check-in the type of apt. I’m off season with property almost empty they thought putting us in a room with construction literally on same wall as the bedrooms
"I visited with a group of 6 friends, we all stayed in the same apartment that had 3 rooms, kitchen and living room which made it amazing. Few places in tulum have that space availability, it made the experience richer... filled with shared laughs and late night talks. Everything was beautiful, they served continental breakfast and offered free shuttle rides to their sister hotel tata at the beach"
" reservations! We quickly communicated the change to our friends and family, and scrambled to find another venue (and reprint invitations and purchase postage stamps!). Not only that but several of our guests who were not planning to stay at Luna Maya had already communicated with nearby hotels to discuss reservations - and now they had to scramble, too.   It wasn't the end of the world, of course, and in the end we were more than thrilled with our final wedding location. Marielena herself was a friendly pe"

I stayed at Casa Macarena for my birthday. It is a really beautiful place. The owners are really attentive to your needs. Nice little nest away from most of crowd in Tulum. The pool was never crowded neither was the roof top. Would visit again. My issues were the Wi-fi that barely worked and the breakfast (not that great in my opinion). Everything else was amazing.
…
"My stay at Casa Macarena was magnificent.  From arrival to departure the service/hospitality of this boutique hotel was was unmatched.  It is run by a kind, loving, professional family which I loved because it gave a feel of being in a private villa versus a busy hotel.  I had high standards as a New Yorker traveling solo to Tulum for my birthday and I couldn't have chose a better property!

I would definately come back again to stay.  The only problem was a loud band in the restaurant across the street one night, but had nothing to do with the hotel.

"Somewhere between the rock hard bed, the cockroaches, and the scent of raw sewage coming up through the pipes the romance was lost. The value Is good though so if you like roughing it I'd still reccomend it. However you will starve in this area if you are on a budget so it somewhat negates the value. A dinner of fish shared between 2 people at the restaurant next door will set you back 700 peso ($70). And the continental breakfast is just toast and fruit. They charge 80- 140 peso for something substantial. "
"El servicio del restaurante agua de mar es excelente y Claudia,Rodrigo y Alain se encargaron de dar un buen servicio. El lugar esta muy como y  limpio, los platillos que nos ofrecieron los recomiendo al 100%   Es un lugar al que regresaría sin duda alguna"
Recomiendo ampliamente el lugar. Cómodo y la atención de 100. El gerente Rodrigo muy amable. Por cierto el platillo riquísimo.  Clau y Alain los felicito por este gran trabajo que hacen para que todo esté excelente.   Sin duda alguna regreso pronto.
"This place is family run and everyone is so helpful! The place is just gorgeous and very secluded. You are a 20 min walk from ruins and the beach. Couldn’t ask for more in a place to stay, it is so convenient and beautiful!"

1. On 29-Sep we booked two rooms on the Tribal Tulum website for a 5 day stay from 08-Nov using the non-refundable rate (NRV). 2. On 29-Sep as the booking referred to two double rooms we asked could one of the double rooms be changed into a twin. Manager Geronimo confirmed that was not possible and if we cancelled the booking we would be charged the full cost of the two room booking. 3. Not a good start but conditions of the NRV booking were clear to us so on 30-Sep we booked a third room for the same perio
"If you want a break from the busy, hectic crowded hotel zone (cars, bikes, mopeds & taxis crowding the road) and something mroe upscale than directly in centro, this is the spot for you. Aldea Zama neighborhood (where highline tulum is located) is perfect. Quiet, relaxing. You can bike, walk moped into centro for more affordable food, atms and bars (i preferred centro over the bougie overpriced beach area. i stayed there for 2 days and was grateful I had the rest of my trip at highline).

i was surprised with this stay by my boyfriend for my birthday! absolutely loved everything about it! he knows i love the bohemian style since we live in NYC and live a pretty hectic lifestyle.

Although the hotel is new and up in coming with adding the amenities of a hot tub and a restaurant i felt like it was perfect for a getaway and connecting with nature. you do have access to plenty of shops and restaurants on the strip. our room was on the second floor of the 
" case you want to)  the beach is gorgeous, clean and quiet.  the shower was not hot nor cold and it was salty which in my opinion added to the experience of it. the service was generous and so friendly. one of the best birthdays i have experienced. i would definitely be back."

"Upon a lengthy checkin we noticed the private penthouse/pool was filthy and bugs/big spiders everywhere! When the cleaning lady finally came she acknowledged it also - everything was dirty - spiderwebs on the safe! FYI if you’re booking for the private pool it’s not worth it, Aldea zama has tons of bugs and they never turn on the pool filter (they did maybe 2 out of the 8 times I requested - making this feature worthless. The place has no charm or character either - a big box. Also it is a legitimate 40 min"
"If you want to stay at a hotel that communicates clearly about what it's doing with your credit card and security, then The Highline Tulum is not the place for you. I had a pleasant enough stay in a nice room here, however the complete ignoring of my attempts to call and email them made the final experience very unsatisfactory. Firstly, I paid the requested USD 400 security deposit a week before my booking. They then confirmed that the transaction had occurred. After I checked out, I contacted them to ask w"
" they could not get a reply from the hotel. After repeated attempts to phone, email and direct message them, I received no reply even 11 days after my first attempt. I then wrote a review on Booking . com detailing my experience, and within three hours I received a response finally. The explanation for how they handled the security deposit was very different to how it was framed when I first made my booking. There is still no confirmation number or transaction record showing my deposit being returned, nor a"

The property is very underwhelming. First double check that you're in the room that you paid for. This happened to us where they changed rooms at the last moment and also some parts of the property seemed to have individual owners and others seem to be operated like a hotel. We learned this after talking to other guests so your experience can be very inconsistent.   The pool area has an insufficient number of chairs for all the guests they have at the property. They have counters next to the pool for food &
 your garbage down to a bin area next to the property which was always overflowing with garbage. The location is difficult to find because of general insufficient signage throughout Aldea Zuma.   I would never stay here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone!

"Muchas gracias por toda su ayuda durante nuestras vacaciones. I love this place, they are an eco friendly hotel..they have solar panels and the showering water comes from cenotes..AC from 6pm-4am. Pro tip: go out during the day to explore and come back around 5pm to shower and relax.. Wifi goes on at that hour as well. Americans will hate that, but I didn’t mind. I spoke to our hosts and they told us that they like to keep it as real as possible. It’s not a luxury hotel, it’s more like really cute rooms tha"

"I stayed there 2 nights by myself .  The room was really beautiful and clean ,but since the room was in the back of the building,unfortunately I didn’t get Lot of light ...it was really dark and I had to turn on the lights even during the day ..  Also the hotel is right at a bar and at night the music is really really loud .. so if you there to rest ,no way ...

"Ce lieu est parfait pour ceux qui fuient le vacarme des villes toutistiques. Propre, bien equipé, bien entretenu, petites attentions. Les conseils de Raúl, le gerant du lieu, ont été très utiles durant notre séjour. Nous retournerons un jour."
Amazing place with a unique feel to it. We stayed two nights here and enjoyed it very much. The shared kitchen is clean and handy and is a relaxing area to hang out in. We found no problem with insects inside our room. It is very quiet and ideal for people enjoy the serenity of nature. The bed was very comfortable. I would recommend having a car while staying here as it is in the jungle and far from downtown Tulum.
"We booked via Airbnb. The place is very isolated, and designed for nature lovers. Amazing concept, little pool, and nice beds. In case people are afraid of bugs, make sure to inspect room before going to sleep. Other than that, very nice and chill place to recover from city life."
I have a really bad experience today! Please read before book because there is a lot of issues in this property. I leave my IPhone on the bed and the clean lady stole it there is video probe but the manager didn't want me to have it or help me recover it. His name is Isidro Gamboa Fuentes he was very rude and if you read other comments is not the first time this happened. I am on vacation and now I can't contact nobody please be careful.
"I booked it from Airbnb. Some tips you need to notice at first. This place is far away from the downtown, so you must have a car to get there. It locates in a place that looks like a forest, which make it hard to access. Completely dark at night, and the road would become kind of scary, so I recommend to check-in in the afternoon. The host provides dinners but you need to book in advance. There are no restaurants around.   The settings here are simple, but not shabby: you will get all the basic stuff you ne"
"The room had old furniture and the bathroom was old but clean. It was quiet with good AC.  The location isn’t too bad, is around 10-15 minutes walk to Tulum center where are most of the restaurants and bars. Overall I would say it was worth it due to the low price and cleanliness. "
"What can I say about this place, as it has both positive and negative aspects? Positive: Good location / price, size of room, safe parking, friendly staff Negative: noise from the major road used by trucks right next to it, mold in the bathroom.  All in all a decent experience, but would not stay there again."
"As the plan was to explore nearby attractions and cenotes, all we needed was a decent, reasonable place to sleep. This small hotel was a very pleasant surprise for the price! The building is located just two short blocks from main avenue. There is private, safe parking. It has gated entrance and a security guard at night. Great location if you drive! Room is very clean and bed is comfortable. Wifi is ok, but signal in not very strong, not great internet phone.  Great pizza restaurant next door, and many che"
"Situated on the far south of Tulum this is a very basic hotel although clean and with a free parking. Rooms are plain and quite gloomy, bath needs a big refurbishment. Anyway staff is very helpful and you can find tea and coffee all day long in the lounge just across the reception."
"I enjoyed staying here. It was quiet and pleasant. The bed was good and the room was clean. We didn't really see the staff all that much but I presume they're friendly.  Like in other Mexican hotels - I have to say that plastic mattress protectors are not my favourite, they don't breathe and are not ideal for sleeping on.  The shower was really hard to get the temperature right... it was either way too hot or too cold.  The room was nice though :)"

"Hey guys!!  Sono stata un 5 giorni in questo favoloso hotel a Tulum.  Le persone sono super nice, gentili, disponibili e sanno super consigliare i migliori posti di Tulum per uscire!  Si possono prendere delle biciclette per fare dei lunghi giri accanto al mare, rilassante al massimo. Super consigliato!!!!"
"Un'oasi di pace nel centro di TULUM. Tornassi indietro riprenoterei altre 100 volte questo hotel, standard molto alti, pulizia ottimale, camere super moderne, buon wifi, parcheggio di fronte, posizione centrale e infine...alloggiando li avrete l'ingresso omaggio al Cenote casa tortugas (circa 11 km da Tulum), che merita davvero in quanto è magnifico e praticamente sconosciuto."

Las habitaciones son muy cómodas, tienen aire acondicionado y la decoración súper bonita. El staff super amigable y me dieron recomendaciones super buenas de Tulum. 100% lo recomiendo!"

"Well… It's not the right word to describe this haven of tranquillity, to be honest; I will go with thoughtfulness. While the dorm rooms don’t offer anything special (with the exception of AC, for a decent price), the two private rooms/apartments are unique. Almost all furniture and decorations are handmade, always using upcycling and recycling. There’s a cool rooftop area – simple and laid back.   Let's go back to thoughtfulness... The staff is so caring of the environment that they inspire you to want to c"

Fresh, clean and crisp sheets and bedding. Hot water and power from the shower. Open plan kitchen, dining room and lounge. Leading out onto a private decked area with sun beds, chairs and a large di"
"I just returned from an incredible 12 day stay in Tulum. What attracted me to Villas Colibri was the fact that it was in Tulum but secluded from the chaos of town and also the beach YET still easily accessible.   I spent my mornings making myself breakfast and then would get a cab to go to the beach. I'd return in the evening take a dip in the pool relax and repeat the same thing the next day. It was glorious.   You are provided with a binder full of information upon arrival, which is extremely helpful. The"

Cabs are cheap anyway so spending the cash for a quick cab ride is affordable. The last day I was there it was cloudy so I did take the bike and it's a quick ride into town if this is what you want to do. Riding to the beach would be a much longer ride.   If you are staying for a long time I'd recommend getting a car and takin"

"We liked the studio with enough space for sleeping, cooking and the washroom. It is a truly quiet place to relax and enjoy the holidays. We even liked to talk to Jilian. She always gave us the required information."
"We stayed (and worked remotely) at Casa Colibri for 6 weeks and had a really great experience. Jillian was amazingly responsive and professional for anything we needed (and her dogs are adorable too). The rooms were comfortable with great beds and nice kitchenettes. Tropical birds and a nice little pool to cool off in make the accommodation complete. Regarding the one negative review, prospective guests should disregard. If a bumpy driveway or a barking neighbor dog are problems, you don't belong in Mexico."
" a walk to the central part of town, but it's pleasant enough when you take the side streets. There are several restaurants that are within a 10-minute walk/3-minute bike ride, including pizza, seafood, and Zine. There are also a couple phenomenal ""local"" food stands and 3 tiendas within 2-3 blocks. In all, we had a fantastic experience and couldn't recommend Casa Colibri highly enough!"

"My second time in Tulum. Villas Colibri was the best place I could imagine to stay at. Perfectly designed apartment, equiped with all you need. Super comfortable bed, huge windows that let the fresh air and sunbeams wave through the room. I love the neighborhood Valeta with its super sweet and so friendly Mayan inhabitants. Everyone greets you in the streets. We felt very at home. Jillian, the host of Vilas Colibri was absolutely gorgeous. Helpful, easy, relaxed and so kind. Her husband helped us finding th"

Very comfortable beds and an awesome shower. Such attention to detail and design.  I would love to stay here again."
"Un petit déjeuner exceptionnel au milieu de la jungle ! Notre guide Ursula, nous a fait découvrir ce lieu , lors de notre visite des Cenotes à velo . Le patron (Francais) et le personnel sont très sympathiques . Une pause en pleine nature, loin de l’agitation de Tulum , à découvrir !"
"We stayed at Ikal bungalows with 6 more friends.  All the apartments are fully equipped (there are 3 of them), everything you need yo have. The design is so gorgeous! all the deco details are amazing. It was such a pleasure to just close the door and forget about the rest of the world. I can't wait to go back!"
"If you want to experience a real jungle stay, then this place is it! Beautifully designed traditional Mexican palapas in the heart of the jungle yet only 15 minutes away from anywhere you want to be in Tulum, be it beach or the centre.  The host is very knowledgeable, shares a lot of advices and is a super good cook! The breakfast is delicious and home made. Some ingredients are also the fruits of the estate! Staying there is like living indoors all while being outdoors all the time.  You can use the kitche"

There's no words to describe this beach. It is simply breathtaking. You'll be amazed by the turquoise waters and the beauty surrounding the beach. There were not a lot of accommodations on the beach so make sure to bring all necessities.

The property is made up of 3 large bungalows that are all decorated beautifully with fully equipped kitchens, a private pool, and a yoga shala. The yoga shala was perfect for sharing meals, as there are tables and chairs set up there, and we also hired a yoga instructor to provide morning classes, which was a great way to start our day! It was a simple taxi to the beach where there are dozens of beach clubs who cater to the publi"

You need to experience this farm and garden hidden in the jungle. Quentin is a most gracias host and prepares a fabulous brunch. Fresh from his garden and unique additions like the flavored honey to put in your coffee. The filling meal was vegetarian and was a hit with the 3 meat-loving males in our family.
"We enjoyed our stay.  We felt very welcomed and taken care of by the warm, lovely staff, especially Alex who speaks English well.  They offered a small, continental breakfast, and the view couldn't be beat.  We stayed in #1 and #2, the best views of the entire place...and had breezes to offset the sometimes unbearable heat.

The private beach was quaint and beautiful, but I preferred to walk down to other restaurants with private beaches, which were a little more open and less rocky. This hotel was one of the more affordable places in tulum playa ($56 us per night-which was a promotion), compared to many of the neighboring hotels which range from $125-$500 per night.

You are rude, dishonest and deserve nothing good given your poor behavior and bad manners. You run a cheap place that looks and feels terrible and think that it is the ny Waldorf Astoria.

"I cannot say enough good things about Chill Kanil.  There are so many resort and hotel options in the hotel zone (along the beach) and in town. It can be overwhelming. But I am so glad we found Chill Kanil.  Located in a secluded, quiet street near the Tulum city center, the boutique hotel feels like a large bed and breakfast with about 10 rooms. There is a serene pool with ample lounging chairs and beds. Lush greenery. An adorable, friendly dog patrolling the villa. Reception desk at the front. An amazing "

I loved staying here. The staff was very helpful and welcoming. The beds were large and each have a personal fan and storage locker. For The price it was well worth it. It is also right in the heart of beach side Tulum. Lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. Lastly there is a Cenote right behind the hostel which was a life saver on hot days!

There was a pool bar and restaurant that both weren’t open in the high season. The air conditioner output is on the balcony so you can’t really sit there in peace - plus the chairs are not comfortable. It’s a two star place by American/European standards.

A nice hotel with very helpful staff! They are happy to advice you for the tours in the area and also very helpful by planning the transportation to the airport of Cancun.

The final bit is about how renting a ‘condo’ fits in with the BP resort. ‘Resort Living’ is what the wristband says. We had originally booked Quetzal Apartments by the golf club. We booked via Booking.com and it all seemed to be straightforward. On arrival, we were told a number of conflicting reasons why we could not check in to Quetzal: that the room was still being clea"
" that the apartment would not be available at all!  It turns out that there was some conflict between the owner of the apartment and BP Residences Management. The owner had not enabled repairs on the property, therefore the Management were preventing its rental.  We felt like a pawn in this interaction. We were forced to wait for around 2 – 3 hours to successfully get into an apartment. We were told we would get an upgrade to a different complex – the Anah Tulum apartments and then we were shown into the wr"

This hostel was clean and well kept.  It is about 3 or 4 blocks off the main drag and therefore pretty quiet.  I stayed in a 3 bunk bed dorm room.  It was comfortable.  Other guests were considerate.  Plenty of places to sit and relax.  Free Breakfast. Free coffee. Free Wifi which worked well.  Plenty of hot water.  I liked the place.  Big kitchen for your use if you want to cook. Restaurants nearby.
"This hostel has alot of potential - its a very nice building with a large, well equipt kitchen, sofa area and nice terrace. However it was extremely quiet and taking a closer look it definitely needed abit of painting and life putting back into it. On the roof there was a pool without water, and the toilet and shower facilities up there were pretty poor - this left only 1 bathroom on the main floor where there was a 10 bed, 2 6 bed, and an 8 bed dorm. Lucky it was quiet really!  Breakfast was very basic - w"
"A very small hotel for people who appreciate the quiet! It is at the end side of Tulum and easy to find. The rooms are clean and spacious. The hotel is exactly as advertised in the pictures. There is no front desk but the owner in advance send you a welcome email and keeps in touch with you by message so someone can receive you. I like that its very private and away from all the noise from dowtown Tulum. If you are looking for privacy, peace and quiet this is for you. I would go there again. "
"I moved to Hostel Charly's from another place in Tulum, to get away from the noise, and was very impressed with this place.  It's about 5 blocks off the main drag, in a quiet neighbourhood, a BIG place with high ceilings, 3 bathrooms (one on each floor), a quiet rooftop area with a pool that has no water in it (hmmmm...), friendly staff, and a great backpacker crowd.  I booked online for the 10-bed dorm, and when I checked in, it was full, so for the same rate, I got a bed in the 6-bed dorm, with a cool and"
" AT the hostel.  Wifi was good, bikes were available for use (free), breakfast was hearty, staff were helpful and friendly, common areas were available to hang out, both indoors and outdoors.  Met some really cool travellers here, will totally go back next time I'm in Tulum. REALLY liked being a few blocks away from the tourists on the main drag, in a quiet, hip hostel."
"Vacationed from Feb 16-23, 2018 – We usually do the all inclusive thing, this year we needed to try something else.  I don’t know if I want to share this gem with everyone!  We arrived at Casa del mar Tulum and Luis the owner was waiting for us.  The place is not easy to find as there is no sign outside but Google map brings you right there He showed us to our room and explained how everything worked.  Explained that there was a small convenience store around the corner with eggs, milk, water, basic things."
…
The hostel is a bit away from the Main Street. Therefore it's very quiet there. They have a nice terrace and kitchen. They cooked me a good breakfast. If you rent somewhere a bicycle you can store it also inside. It was also a clean place.
"We had a nice air-conditioning room with breakfast included.  The only bad note is that for the whole hostel,  around 30 beds,  there were only 2 bathrooms,  which is ridiculous! And they only cleaned them once a day!  There is a nice common area and a huge,  well-equipped kitchen. "
"I booked a bed in a girl's dorm for 3 nights and ended up staying only 1 as I didn't like this place one bit. The dorms are tiny with barely any space between the beds to move around or put your luggage.  Guys were staying in my dorm even though I specifically asked if it was a female only dorm.  Only one bathroom for all the guests in the house, no need to say it just wasn't clean (how could it with this many people using it). This is the typical kind of place where owners are there to make money rather th"
Wir waren für 1 Woche im Esencial in Tulum  untergekommen und hatten eine super Zeit!  Anreise Wir kamen gegen Nachmittag am ADO Busbahnhof an und fuhren mit dem Taxi zum Hotel. Wir wurden bereits von der Rezeption erwartet und hatten ein Garten Doppelzimmer ohne Terrasse.  Das Zimmer Ausreichend groß mit Kühlschrank und funktionierender Klimaanlage sowie einem bequemen Bett. Das Bad war angrenzend an den Raum mit einer Dusche mit gutem Wasserdruck. Generell war das Zimmer sehr schön eingerichtet und sehr s
" in living room. Common space is huge (which is weird compared to dorm size), kitchen is home kitchen rather than a hostel kitchen.  Maybe I should have slept in the living room for more comfort but there were about 3 teenagers sleeping there on the sofa and floor, weird. "

 Seite eingenommen. War gut und man konnte aus verschiedenen Angeboten wählen. Am Strand kann man sich an den benachbarten Hotels mittags einen Snack bestellen. Somit ist man auch am relaxten am Strand versorgt  Sonstiges  ein Supermarkt befindet sich 5 Minuten vom Hotel entfernt. Gerade Wasser und Snacks können gut im Kühlschrank gelagert werden.  Das Hotel verleiht keine Fahrräder. Wir hatten uns diese bei Ola Bikes bestellt (liefern mit Aufpreis auch zum Hotel). Mit dem Fahrrad haben wir die Gegend erkun
"El hostel es muy lindo, está bien ubicado, cerca de bares y de la avenida principal. Carlitos es superamable, muy buena onda y bien predispuesto! Compartimos un delicioso asado con él y nos divertimos mucho (el patio tiene asador, dato importante). La atención es inmejorable. Sin dudas volvería a lo de Carlitos. :)"

"To be 100% honest we did not book at Esencial.  We booked at another location that over booked us.  They bumped us to Esencial.  We are so glad they did!  It was breath taking.  We had a hut right on the beach.  The room was large enough for our family of 4.  Though we didn’t get to see much of Tulum being there for a wedding, we loved it there. Staff were super friendly and helpful. We would book here again.  The only thing I could recommend is maybe having a broom in the rooms to help with keeping the san"
Los dias que nos quedamos en el hostel la pasamos genial. El dueño es muy buena onda y servicial. No dejó que nos falte nada y hasta compartió con nosotros un fabuloso almuerzo. Muy recomendable este lugar! Ademas el dueño es instructor de buceo y hace salidas para bucear en los cenotes por si les gusta las actividades acuáticas.
"I would have given 5 stars if we didn’t have a little issue with our booking charges. Esencial Tulum resolved the issue, just a bit frustrating in the beginning of our stay . However this place is absolutely amazing . Great location, very quiet and peaceful. Breakfast included was a big plus for us . I definitely would recommend this place if you are planning on visiting this magical place. I fall more in love with Tulum each time I visit ❤️"
Excelente estadia!! El dueño del hostel nos brindó toda la informacion turística y nos busco desde la terminal de buses. Es muy amable el dueño!. El lugar es muy limpio y tiene todo los servicios. Esta cerca del centro y de bares.100%recomendable
"ho passato una notte in questa guest house, ma non vedevo l ora di andar via. Non facile da trovare anche perchè all'esterno è completamente buio. Avevamo fissato l' orario approsimativo di arrivo con il proprietario il giorno prima, ma ovviamente arrivando da Ek Balam il che significa 5 ore di auto, gli orario variano. suonato il campanello nessuno ci apre, siamo stati 10 minuti fuori a cercare di capire come farci aprire. IL PROPRIETARIO NON C'ERA! Fortunatamente ci hanno aperto altri ospiti. la struttura"
"The discounts they have for a multi night stay are surprising, ended up with a 20% discount. Beds are the most comfortable I have slept in. The best part is that they are located in the center of town so I didnt have to go far for my neccesites, and they have shuttle services to the airport definitly be staying here again."
"This hotel was fine, very basic room. It seemed clean. The hotel across the street was playing very loud music from 10pm-2am, which was awful if you wanted to sleep. The hotel is off the main street which is easy for getting around but again, loud and weird. The WiFi was good and there was a tv in the room. Only paid $112 USD which was a good rate."
"Hotel clean and a nice big bed. Staff very friendly. Rooms have a strange moldy smell, although the building seems quite new. Breakfast you get served in the room, (30 min late) in a fast food plastic manner. Only one spoon for two people... No table nor chairs to sit and eat. They rather would not offer breakfast."
"we were there for 5 nights.  the location was great. that was the best bed we had in mexico, and the hot shower was also very good it was very clean, and change towel every day. there is Wi-Fi in the rooms but the signal was a bit low in the upper rooms. (it might be becasue of the heavy rain)  becasue it's in the center there could be a little noise at night but it really wasn't that bad (wasn't a problem for us and we are sensitive to noise) the stuff is super helpful , very nice and would help in any way"
they said they couldn't run my cc and to send via email. It was supposed to be like a $500 charge then they charged me 5k and said it was non refundable and too late to cancel. It was no joke... about 8 hours of my time dealing with my bank and this fraud hotel. They were very professional in pulling off this fraud as they did several things to try an ensure they keep the fraudulent money.
"In all my travels over the years I’ve never had a bad experience at a hotel or resort. This hotel was very different. From jack hammers and construction starting at 6am every day right next to our villa to constant powers outages during our entire stay. Due to being a beach villa, the fan was the only means of temperature control in the room. When the power was out discomfort was high and a scared infant below us was terrified judging by the cries. This resort was stated to be 17+ years old adults only on E"
"We booked Casa Marivan in Bacalar with this property manager. The house is reasonably good but it doesnt sleep 14. Bathrooms (only 3) are very small and dont work for that many people. The ktichen is old, dirty, not effecient and lacks equipment. Towells are a disgrace.  The cleaning service is bad and the house is never clean. The guy that helps in everything lacks basic training and people skills. The pictures in the page are inaccurate.  The house has no connection to electric power and uses a generator "
"My ocean-view room at Agua Eco Design was slightly overpriced (most beach hotels in Tulum are...), but I had a relaxing, enjoyable stay nonetheless. I was on the 2nd floor of a casita, and it was flooded with ocean breezes and natural light. (Guests on the 2nd floor must climb about 20 steps and they are VERY steep.) The thatch roof, ceiling fan, and mosquito net all contributed to the laid-back, beachy vibe.  I kept the windows open because the breeze was so lovely - my favorite part!    The king bed was c"

"I was very upset to see that our room that goes directly to the beach closes on a small children's lock. We were very afraid to leave any valuable items in the room. The hotel, hiding behind the eco-friendly hotel, saves on everything, especially on your safety.  Be careful when booking this hotel, it is not worth the money. You can book a more secure hotel at the same price and with a higher level of service."
"We are looking to book however everyone seems to have massive issues with your hotel, from dirty linens to rude staff pretending there is no problem. And the water in the showers as salt water. I would like to know if the hotel has addressed the issues and is supplying clean rooms with fresh towels and fresh sheets. And if the salt water has been fixed. We stay in eco hotels in Mexico frequently and we have never experienced the “salt water” of all of the complaints, but would like to know when this is fixe"
"We chose this expensive ""boutique hotel"" relying on a high rating. But after check-in it became clear that the hotel is very overvalued.  The hotel doesn't care about the cleanliness of rooms, bed linen and towels. The hotel doesn't see problems in the presence of only salt water in the shower and doesn't write about it anywhere in the description.  When we drew the attention of the administration to problems with cleanliness and only salt water in the bathroom and asked to cancel reservation and return mon"
" has NO problems with cleanliness and there is NO SALT WATER in the shower.  In the end, Booking.com acknowledged the problems and paid us a little compensation.  We had to stay in this hotel and it was the worst time of our holiday. We had to buy more than 11 gallons (more 40 liters) of fresh water to be able to wash off the salt.  Be careful when booking this hotel: it doesn't match the 4 stars and the high price. The hotel isn't interested to solve any of your problems. Administration - LIARS."

Le lieu est magnifique malgré la plage rocheuse. Mais le personnel gâche TOUT. On est venu à 4 dans un 151m2 mais un membre du staff nous refusait l’entrée par téléphone parce que l’appartement est prévu pour 3 (un 151m2... pour 3!!) et nous demandant de partir ou de trouver une chambre pour une personne ailleurs sans remboursement possible. Un 151m2 pour 3 où on ne peut pas rajouter une 4e personne!du jamais vu au cours de toutes ces années de voyage et d’hôtels!!  Même si on est serré dans un 151m2 c’est

Au final je vous rassure on a pu y séjourner après deux heures de négociation d’un autre monde et hallucinant!! Enfin bref, un séjour gâché par cet « administrateur »"

"While this hotel is not far from the city or beach in distance, it will take you an hour to get to the there. This hotel is located down a long dirt road that makes it difficult for taxi's or delivery service to get to. We ordered food (there isn't a restaurant or room service) and the delivery driver got lost and ended up taking a long time to get dinner. We ended up making other accommodations at another hotel down by the beach. Good thing we did because the following day it took us over an hour to get to"

"Nos encantó el lugar, pudimos hacer parrillada, beber algo con vista al mar. No hay ruido, puedes hacer caminatas por la playa sin gente. Todo está muy limpio y tienes todo lo necesario para cocinar. La concierge muy atenta y amable."
Loved coming to Pancho Villa when me and my friends scaled the beach. Senora Elizabeth is an awesome bartneder that kept the drinks coming as we swung on the beach front and enjoyed the views even on the days when it rained! Stop by if you want a drink or need to cool off while walking across the beach!
"Great place, food was Good, Nice Mojitos! And they accept credit card!  The music is Good is not like other beach club with eletronic music ALL day! There is only a few beach lounger to lie on.. but the tables/chairs are Good! "
"I stayed in this hostel for just one night on the way to Cancun. I did not expect much, and chose it because it was right across the ADO terminal, accepted cancellations, etc. I was really surprised by its quality. Well, I think that most people come to Tulum area for beach resorts. I was not one of them, so stayed in the city. This hotel was wonderful. I have read one of ealier reviews (2017) with complaints on lack of plug sockets, a/c and small washrooms. Nothing was applicable to my room in 2019. There "

"Herman and Fabie welcomed us for ten days on our trip; they were friendly and welcoming (they turned out all the lights on the entire property for us one night so we could enjoy some incredible star gazing), despite the fact that our knowledge of Spanish was weak. The eco-villa is clean and very comfortable. If you're the kind of traveller who likes to get away from touristy crowds (we are), then you might be happy here.   On site, there is a pool to cool off in, if you wish, as well as a 2km walking trail."
The hostel is really noisy because of the main road just in front. And the cleaning lady don't just change sheets but also search in the closet to steals things. The restaurant is good and the pool also but this problem ruined my stays in this hostel. You can't trust people here.
"This hotel is a nice place in an affordable place and convenient location, my advice is; do not pay the extra for the breakfast, it just includes fruit. Save some money and use it to take a real breakfast in the near Tulum city."

There is a guard on the premises all night. Bikes are available if you wish to bike up the street to the supermarket. There many several stores and bars nearby.

great staff charming grounds nice little pool (not needed it was raining) great value rented bikes to cruise around good bike trail to the beach.these room were very basic  no tv (thank God) one light in main room also the bath. very clean plenty of hot water to shower with.several cenotes within an easy bike ride.
Ugh. A cute hotel spolied by staff hanging at the desk from 6:30am daily means you are up when they are. Repeated requests to the same staff did not change their behaviour.   The hotel had no internet during our multiday stay.  Hip straw and stick walls mean mosquitos.   
"Man this was an amazing place to stay.  Off the main road, but you didnt hear any traffic and the condo was in the back by the pool.  Quiet at nite.  About 90% is rented out.  But its a great place to stay."

"This is a economy hotel, and it is all what you need. If you are in this area you will not need a fancy all-inclusive hotel with luxuries that won't be used as you will be outside enjoying. The rooms are basic but kept tidy, no AC or TV but no need for these things anyway. An hotel to experience the contact with the nature, you can see birds, racoons, squirrels as it is in the middle of the jungle and have its own access to a cenote. Across the street the beach is paradisiac, access is through another hotel"
 luxury travelers and for those looking other experiences is better to look somewhere else. Breakfast is very basic but again the kitchen is open to prepare what you want. Another type of tourism and you will find another type of tourists around.

"Usually, when I am travelling, I tend to book boutique hotels, or more well-maintained four-star hotels. However, this booking was made because I wanted a low-key more eco-resort type of stay. If you are looking for a high-end, all-inclusive resort like stay, this is not the place to be. All the hotels along this strip are eco-based hotels, Nomande Tulum would be the luxe option along the strip, but this hotel, in particular, is quite a good option for those would like to have salt-showers, an open-kitchen "

I can not say I hate it because we had fun but it was quite an adventure. The pictures look much better that what is looks in real life so that is why we booked it.

"The place it's really peaceful, inside of the jungle. Waking up with the sounds of the nature was another level of satisfaction. I feelt revitalized. Pool it's really big and has a part wich it's depeer than the rest of the pool, on the common area there's some games and the paint ball camp it's really fun.  The entire place was only for us and that's something pretty cool on this quarantine times."
"Nous avons été accueillis à bras ouverts par Marta et Gian Luca, un couple bienveillant, qui sait d'emblée vous mettre à l'aise. Nous avons très bien dormi, nous avons de très bon petits dejeuners. Nous avons également profité de leur grande terrasse aménagée pour profiter le soir venu des étoiles. Nous avons beaucoup ris avec leur chat Frida qui etait trop mignonne et qui veillait aussi au bien être des convives.   Mille fois merci pour ce séjour formidable à vos cotés !!!!   Chloe & Sonny <3"
"Ever since I started coming to Tulum years ago, this has been the only place I would stay. Tulum has been changing, for better or for worse, Marta and Gianluca have been building up their place, and still remain to have the same hospitality, clean and lovely home, and most importantly, keeping the spirit of Tulum the way it always has been, behind the private entrance into the jungle, just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Tulum center it has become.   It may be tempting to stay in Tulum city for che"
"The place is central in Tulum, it offers all the basics, it’s clean and the host Josue is the nicest person in town, people is friendly here. Really recommend, for the price it’s the best you can get if you want some typical place."
"room was comfortable and had air con and free WiFi  toilet was lacking a door (curtain only), but the pool, gardens and safe front door made up for this  staff were friendly and it is close to the main road and various shops and facilities"
"Hotel muy bueno la atención del bell Angel Castillo excelente recomendaciones de lugares que conocer playas, cenotes, grutas, pueblos, restaurantes, etc y su atención como persona excelente gracias Ángel de todos los lugares que he visitado la atención de ángel la mejor"
"Posto perfetto come base per girare la zona, camere spaziose, pulizia accurata e prezzo economico! Vicinissimo ad un grande supermercato e a dieci minuti a piedi dal caotico pueblo sulla strada per la spiaggia a circa 5 km, caldamente consigliato noleggio biciclette una perfetta pista ciclabile ti porta al mare in 15 minuti."
"The room was clean and big enough, with aircondition and a fan. The beds where big and nice. The toilet/shower rom was ok, and clean. They didn´t have refrigerator on our room, as it said in their ad. There where no safe on the room and they didn`t have a restaurant, but it was only two minutes walk to the nearest one. The personal was nice and polite, but they didn`t speak english. The hotel is a little outside Tulum centrum, about 15 minutes walk."
"Stayed 10 nights in Casa Wahh in Dec  21. Its new development area, guarded entrance but many building still ongoing (not next to Wahh). Its 3-floors apartment hotels, new and clean. We had pool room with small private pool and garden. Room itself is very nice and large.  There is no major services, cleaning in room is for extra cost.  Concierge is there daily and can help with arrangements but sometimes her information was not complete or was out-date.    Location is ok if you have a car. There are few res"
"I own a condo in Grand Bahia Principe Resort which is fantastic, but the service I got from my property manager, Kiin Luxury Resort Condos, is the worst. I notified Kiin on Jan. 21 that I would be using my condo from Feb. 24 through Mar. 5, 2020.  When we arrived there were no sheets, towels, duvets, bath mats or kitchen towels in the unit.  I purchased 6 sets of sheets and towels, 4 kitchen towels, 2 bath mats, 2 duvets and covers that have had less than 60 days of use and none were available.  I had to ma"
"We stayed as a family of 4 (including a 4 year old and baby) at Condo Hotel Romaya and it could not have been a better place from which to explore Tulum. It was amazingly good value and we got better rates by contacting Diego directly than booking through a travel website.  From first contact and throughout our stay Diego was friendly, helpful and couldn’t do enough to help us. His English is great. He was brilliant with the kids too and whenever he saw us go in the pool he made sure to come and turn on the"
"Clean flats with ok design, but we experienced a smelly one. Good beds, and ok furniture, The apartments are part of a huge gated all-inclusive area. Had to buy day pass to be able to spend time at the beach or eat at the restaurants . No shops. Need car. Safe and quiet. "
"It is a nice condo complex but very poorly managed. Our condo wasn't ready, even passed the check-in hour and very dirty. We asked the management to clean for 3 days and the whole place still lacked basic hygene during the whole stay. Because we complained about not being able to use the dirty kitchen, the manager started harrasing us, ffinally forcing us to pay in the middle of the night before the day we checked out."
 when we wanted and there were swimming towels as well as bath towels. The housekeeping service was excellent and they even worked around our children's naps. The air conditioning units in the bedrooms were great and drinking water was provided. The balconies and garden had hammocks and outside seating and meant there was always somewhere to enjoy the view/sounds if Mexico. The dawn chorus is worth getting up for to enjoy from a hammock on the balcony! There can be some noise from the surrounding streets in
…
"The staff where friendly and helpful, they even upgraded us to a beautiful apartment with loads of space and an amazing view.   The beach was only a 10 minutes free ride away; with a great value snack bar, all you can eat and drink (alcohol even) for $15.  Lots to do in the resort from sailing, fishing, jungle tours, casinos and a varity of night time shows for kids and adults.  We had a great time!"
"Excelente hotel, es pequeño pero muy acogedor, todo está muy limpio, la atención de la recepción  muy buena, muy cómodo hotel ya que cuenta con cocina y no es necesario salir, tiene una alberca muy bonita, y claro que  lo recomiendo 100%."
"The place is absolutely amazing. It’s calm, quiet and has a really good vibe. The staff is also lovely and so nice. I loved it! Until me and my friends (who stayed in other rooms) got bedbug bites all over our body. At first we were like no it’s not that it’s fine. But later on we understood that that was the case. Some girls who lived there before us and during our stay checked out days earlier because they got bitten. And the hostel didn’t do anything about it other than change sheets for the next person "
"Beware, this is NOT a hotel. My flight was unexpectedly delayed in-flight and I was not able to enter the house when I arrived. My attempts to reach the property went unanswered. I called Booking.com who was not able to get a response from the property either. Desperate to not sleep on the streets of Tulum, Booking.com helped me find a hotel with a 24 hour front desk.  The following afternoon, I received a WhatsApp message from a person named Karla who tells me I'll get a refund for my reservation and that "

"I will try to be fair and give a thorough review in hope to assist others when choosing . We were a group of 4 , on arrival at night in heavy rain the road that leads to apt’s itself was poorly kept ( expected since is not paved but still hard in a small car ) The apt on arrival was good but humid due to rain . We arrived tired so when to shower to find there was not hot water .

" 2 adults having a short shower each filling time . So if u travel with 4 or more be aware you may have to finish your shower with cold water . The internet is ok but at night mostly didn’t load anything so again if  many using at same time you won’t load anything. Kitchen utensils were basic but missing bottle opener , can opener ,and wine glasses . No large pots either . There was no tv which for me was a shame as would have made it so much better . Overall was a good stay as the place is comfortable but "
…
"Me and my husband had a really unpleasant experience at “saasil” during our honeymoon.  The price is really cheap and tempting, and indeed it is a huge apartment with a private pool, but (!!!) It's really cheap for a reason- for two days we had no water!! We had to Brush our teeth and wash our face with a mineral bottle. And I didn’t mention how disgusting it was in the toilets. Also, when we still had water,  the water in the shower was salty!   We complained to the manager there, who promised to refund us"
" more than a month he returned half the amount he was supposed to, and disappeared.   This too, after endless calls and messages from us.  Recommends everyone not to go there,  We were really disappointed."

"Es un hotel pequeño pero lleno de buena vibra. Es un espacio cómodo, las recámaras tienen Ac Y baño propio. En la áreas comunes puedes leer un libro, cocinar, guardar comida y convivir Lo que más me gusto es que la dueña es mexicana y es muy atenta y amable, una joven emprendedora ❤️  Recomendado 100%"
"El hotel está muy bien equipado con cocina, microondas, y vajilla, la cama es comoda ,el baño es amplio , tiene una TV gigante y un ventanal también muy grande. Cuenta con una terraza con piscina muy bonita que me permitió hacer gym y relajarme. La atención es excelente, nos han dado consejos muy útiles y con mucha dedicación. La ubicación es buena ya se que está cerca del centro y con negocios para poder preparar una comida. Sin dudas volvería a este lugar."
"A three night stay at this wonderful property begins tonight, and I can already tell you that the proprietor is the best local guide you could hope for. The location is a short 5 minute walk from the main highway. Close enough for convenience and far enough to be quiet. Check it out and enjoy!"
"Excelente servicio y un lugar muy limpio, la experiencia y el buen trato desde la llegada hasta la partida del lugar.  Sin duda un lugar que deben visitar para compartir en familia o solo, tienen áreas comunes en excelente estado, recomendable al 100%"
"We booked a room for two nights, but soon after we arrived we decided to cancel and looked for another hotel. Cancellation was a huge problem and owner was rude on the phone (supposedly a superhost). Room was smelly (definitely mold but kinda like some bug spray too?), doesnt have some amenities listed in posting. Curtains covered in mold from floor to ceiling, couch had stains all over, all 4 towels - dirty, like they’ve been on the floor. Bed - suspicious, we didnt want to sleep in it. Some clumps of dust"
"Bravi i proprietari che ti accolgono a qualsiasi ora, sono disponibili in tutto. La zona è in sviluppo tra tulum e il mare, ed e già bella così, immagino quando il quartiere sarà terminato. Al mare ci si arriva in bici, gli appartamenti sono belli e confortevoli. Posto ideale per visitare il Messico da soli in piena indipendenza. "
" wouldn't recommend to anyone. For half price we found a family run hotel that wasnt as modern, but spotless and with exceptional service."
Avant tout je dois dire que l hôte est très gentil et disponible. Il habite dans le même immeuble si besoin. Le problème principal de se logement est son emplacement. Il se situe dans une zone commerciale en construction. Cette zone est absolument énorme!  Sans voiture oubliez cet endroit! Il n y a rien à faire et rien autour. On est isolé. L appartement est sympa. Clim qui fonctionne parfaitement. Literie parfaite. 
"Premetto che i proprietari dell'appartamento sono veramente persone disponibili e gentili e che hanno cercato di fare tutto il Possibile per farci trascorrere un buon soggiorno.  Complessivamente tuttavia la nostra esperienza non è stata positiva.  L'appartamento è ubicato in un quartiere in fase di costruzione, a metà strada (40 min a piedi) dal mare e il paese di Tulum (30 min a piedi). Il problema di questo luogo è che manca di qualunque cosa, non c'è un negozio dove comprare acqua, non c'è un bar, non c"

"Complimenti a Mary e Massi per l'appartamento, è davvero ben fatto. Abbiamo preso l'appartamento al primo piano,ha un ampio salone,una cucina,due camere e un bagno, effettivamente era anche più di quello che avevamo bisogno. L'unico ""inconveniente"" è che l'acqua che esce dai rubinetti non è potabile quindi per fare la pasta o il caffè si usava l'acqua delle bottiglie. Il centro di Tulum è abbastanza vicino, il mare è più distante ma con le biciclette che sono incluse nella prenotazione ci si può arrivare tr"
"The man at reception was extremely impatient, rude and insulting. One of the least professional and short-tempered men that I've ever encountered in the customer service business.  Aside from that, the hotel is quite far from the action and overpriced compared to options which are cheaper and better located.  The hotel has a rundown, dingy feel and for the price I'd definitely go elsewhere next time. "
"OK if you want a cheaper night in Tulum - we paid 1100 pesos for 2 nights for double room, couldn't find much cheaper. Room was big and had air con but found cockroaches in the bathroom (just after a storm, I don't know if that makes them come out?!) The rooms themselves were clean. Staff pretty miserable and couldn't be bothered. "
"From the outside it awakened the feeling of a typcial American motel along the road. It was simply some rooms, no common area, not even a restaurant and still quite pricy. Together with the fact that it was about a 5 minute Taxi ride from the central bus station of Tulum ( when asking 2 or 3 taxi drivers, none of them actually knew the hotel ) we first regreted our choice. We arrived around 7 PM and there was nobody at the lobby. After waiting a couple of minutes and ringing a bell several times we finally "
"We stayed there for one night. At 6 am, I woke up, suddenly. One of the staff members came into our shared dorm room drunk and touched me, and not in a nice way. I sat up immediately. When the guy realized I was a man, he was shocked and stuttered something along the lines of thinking I was a woman. Fortunately, my female travel companion was not in the room at that moment. Of course, we left as soon as possible."
"If you want boho chic in Tulum go here, great mix of apartment and hotel, concierge great, chic rooms and the best pool . Great public areas and just a really good feeling to it. Simple and elegant furnishings "
"Posada El Hostelito is really good value if your on a BUDGET, it's safe very clean & the staff are so helpful. The owner & his family are really helpful kind people. I had a room that had 2 king size beds , AC/fan TV, & a bathroom. They do have old rideable bikes to hire as well. It's a convenient location with laundry Cafes supermarkets all walking distance. "
"I spent two nights at Posada El Hostelito with a friend. If you don't expect a 5 stars hotel (providing you are not paying for that) I think it is good value for money. Victor, his wife and his father are trustworthy, enjoyable people, always happy to help. It could be cleaner, but it's OK anyway, we were provided with clean sheets and towels. There are no big security features, as the lockers are small and not unbreakable, but overall it feels like a safe place, as Victor or somebody else for him is always"
"I stayed there 4 nights - because my roommates were so nice. We were like a family. If it hadn't been for this acquaintance, I would have left after the first night. Actually, I stayed there only because I didn't want to walk all the way back to the city centre and because it was cheap, only 100 Pesos / night.  There was a rat in the kitchen, and 4 giant cockroaches assembled on the ceiling every evening. They didn't come in the dormitory. The two owners (father and son) are nice and helpful. But they do no"
"If you plan on staying out until 5am, this place will be fine for you. However if you're in the hostel from 9pm-5am and want to sleep, you will have festival-loud dubstep-infused-EDM pumping through your room. I'm so tired."
"The hostel is managed for young guys. They seem cool and friendly, but they're more worry about chilling and smoking pot than about caring about their guests (specially if you aren't a girl). Breakfast isn't included, they air-con didn't work and they just have too many beds per room. They didn't have hot water for a couple of days and when I complained about, the owner did not try to find any solution, he just said that they have problems with the gas company so it's not his fault (maybe's mine?). I also s"
" If you knew, clean it! Then, the next day they took the bed sheets from my bed when I was out, so when I came back to the hostel and asked about them, they said they were sorry, but they thought I had left the hostel. I said that's ok, but I hadn't, so I'd like to have my bed sheets again, and they said sorry again, but at that moment they didn't have any clean bed sheets so I had to wait. I did wait all day, and after asking several times and getting as their only answer that it wasn't their fault if the "

"We left our previous location two days early for Tulum which we were booked into another hostel but not until couple days later so we thought we will just stay here for two nights..  Wish we had access to wifi to look it up beforehand bloody hell. So the best part is having wifi in our room. Otherwise don't bother.. Two of us in a 4 bed dorm with no air con and one fan which didn't do much in the extreme heat. Bathroom was alright.  But sleeping wasn't an option, the extremely loud music was terrible and it"
"If you like dirty rooms with hair, used bed sheets, broken and disgusting toilets, as well as a noisy generators in front of your door, loud electronic music 24/7 and drunk staff (feeling to hip for the world!) for a high price - this is the place where you wanna go to!"
"This has to be the worst place i have ever stayed at. And I am not a person who needs a lot to be satisfied with accommodation. The place was pretty expensive, considering what you get. The problem was that every other place was booked out. We stayed (2 people) in a room for 4 people. The room was dark, smelled, was not clean. You could literally see the mold on the curtains. Under the bed you could see trash, when going around the hostel we noticed some people doing drugs. We could not get any sleep since "
" Also did not feel safe. No breakfast. A terrible place altogether. There was wifi, but could only be accessed from the lobby. Really made the whole Tulum experience awful."
…
My friend and I were already regretting booking two nights at this hostel after five minutes of being there. Where do I start? As soon as we walked into the room it smelled of damp and mould. There was mould on the walls and on the pillows. We were given some bedsheets which didn't smell great either. The room was a TINY space into which they had crammed two bunk beds so you could hardly move. It was incredibly stuffy and boiling hot.  The guy at reception explained that we were only allowed to use the air 
"Great location for a family of five. Clean, spacious, AC and wifi worked well. Close to the beach and downtown Tulum. It's perfect for a family that will be out and about, at beach or site seeing. Not a place you come stay at to hang out by the pool and in your room like a resort. "
"I stayed with friends in the bungalow which was off the street and thus more quiet.  The bungalow is three stories and has one single bed on the first floor (although you could fit more) two double beds on the second floor, and two single beds on the two third floor lofts.  While not directly on the beach, you can still get there by going through No Name directly across the street.  A quaint bar, and regular movie nights make Residencia Gorila Films (Casa Luna Limon's new name) a great place to stay without"
"We came and stayed here my wife and I with our children.  We loved the pool, the flowers and landscaping.  The backyard is a nice place to lay in the sun and tan, or do some remote work by the pool under a palapas or just relax.    One thing we noticed is the caretaker was friendly and welcoming.  Very honest and nice man.  There's a few long term renters who live there and they are also very friendly.  It's a good vibe.   It's a new area so there is new construction around, but it's mainly farther down the"

"Horrible place and for the money we paid it was absolutely not worth it!!! I went there with my friends and it absolutely ruined my stay in Mexico. Worst of all was the staff who lied and accused us of stealing from the owners and breaking a door to a storage, that 100% was broken before we came. At check in they didn't do any proper check probably because this way we wouldn't check every little corner of the house before we got there and they can claim us for money at the end of the stay. Awful people!"
Had a great couple nights on the front end of a trip to the beach. Easy walking and safe to access the town of tulum.  Explored the local shops and enjoyed some amazing food!  Perfect for what we needed and our hosts were lovely with great advice on the area. 
Hice la reserva en este lugar hace aproximadamente 3 meses para el 1 de enero. Ayer me llega un mensaje del anfitrión pidiendo que busque otro alojamiento porque el ya no tenía lugar. Como lo hice vía booking les solicite ayuda y solo envían respuestas automáticas. Horrible experiencia.
"My wife and I spent a week at this wonderful in-town B&B. Paola and Rick are wonderful hosts. We felt part of their family for the week including Paola's mother and their four dogs (made friends with two of them).  Our room looked out on a small pool which we used exclusively for the week; the grounds are impeccably maintained as was the room. The morning breakfast, which we had every morning under the large palapa, was the creation of Paola and her mother. Any restaurant would have a hard time keeping up w"

After 40 min on the phone trying to get in touch with them, a guy appears from nowhere calling us by name saying that he will show us the room.

"First the pros.  Great location.  Walking distance to local bars and restaurants.  Bed was comfortable.  TV had Netflix.  Cons. Many Cons.  This is an older property and shows it.  The 4:00 pm check in is not helpful.  There is no one on site to watch your bags, so you either sit there or drag your bags around town.  Our unit 302 PH looked like a dorm room.

We are an older couple in our fifties and sixties. We had come to Mexico for 2 weeks and had started and ended our holiday in Tulum. Our final hotel was in the town as we had been advised by a fried we might find the beach area boring. How wer after a noisy night with no sleep in the town we ventured to the beach area to try and find last minute accomodation for. 2 nights. It's an expensive area and our usual ear he's did not throw much up so I walked around the area and asked various small hotels what avai
" advisor and was a bit nervous as som of the reviews are pretty awful but I thin, you need to go in with your eyes wide open about what you are getting here and if you want beach access etc be prepared to pay more. Yes it was noisy up until around midnight then all was quiet, and if you stay here have a thought towards,others and don't party all night and be aware others will hear everything and I mean everything you do in your room as there is no insulation between rooms. The worst of this was the creaking"
"I honestly don’t know why hotels are permitted in this area. The main reason for hotels is for rest and sleep. Sleep isn’t possible at this hotel due to location. The music from a number of restaurants/bars on the street goes until 4 am every night. Fortunately, I used my earbuds and listened to white noise all night on my phone.  Otherwise, the staff was friendly, and the hotel was clean and safe (maybe a little run down). If you want breakfast, it’s on the roof. Get there early before the food runs out. I"
…
We paid an extortionate amount to stay here due to New years eve and lack of rooms available. There was no staff or security at the front desk. Very unsecure. Anyone can walk in off the street and the doors to the rooms are not secure. Our room had no proper curtains and our windows were facing the beach (honestly how hard can it be to put in some simple curtains!). The lock on the bathroom door was so rusty it could barely work. Very simple and bare. Concrete floor and spaces within the slats in the door. 
"I stayed here for 4 nights, it’s a great location and walking distance to everything. Lots of bars and restaurants around and awesome night life. The hotel offers free breakfast from one of the local restaurants which consisted of fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juice. Clean room and A/C worked well, rate was $36.00/night Canadian and the staff were very friendly. Only complaint I had was the neighbors dog across the street (I know it’s Mexico and barking dogs are part of it, but this thing was nuts)"
"We couldnt sleep, the área was so loud until 4 am!!! They didnt give us information about this or a chance to choose something better. Breakfast is not good. We wouldnt recommend this place at all...."
"The room was very clean and comfortable-with good quality furnishings and bedding. The air conditioning and fan were great. There was a coffee machine in the room and coffee and drinking water were provided daily. The shower was hot, with good water pressure. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast provided at a restaurant nearby was very good-a choice of juice or coffee, and eggs, fruit and toast. The internet was mediocre at best.

"I've stayed in some pretty rough places and I'm not very picky but I was pretty disappointed with this place. We were in tulum on a pretty busy week and all of the hotels with in our price range were booked. So glad we only had to endure one night here.   PROS -giant room, seriously so huge which was nice -employees were kind and helpful  CONS -location:It's a little bit out of the way. If you have a car it's not a big deal.  - water pressure: the shower dribbles water  -bugs: I know we are in Mexico and I "
 loudest noises  I wouldn't mind staying here for 20$ but we payed 50$ and it just seemed extremely over priced. Only stay here if it's your last resort

"So the room itself was nice - clean, fast wifi, air con worked (TV didn't but we never complained about it so don't know if it could have ended up working), as was the member of staff who checked us in. However, with no car and too stingy to pay for taxis, it was a little far out of town for walking. Doable but a good 30 minutes in the heat."
"Very far away from everything, at night it seem dangerous because it located at the side of a road and if you want to go to the center it hard to get a cab and it is very dark around! The rooms are clean and spacious!"
"We stayed in this hotel for one night. This hotel is far from center and next to the road to Coba with no light. Our room was huge, but there were no hot water, no window, just small window to the office next to us, So there was light all the night. There was also no wifi in the room even they say that there is. You can find better deal in Tulum."
"La sabbia è bianchissima, il colore del mare va dal turchese al blu, ma..troppo affollata, troppi chiringuitos, troppo tutto! Adatta per i ragazzi che amano incontrare coetanei e passare il tempo tra un bagno e un Margarita, da evitare se si cerca la solitudine di una spiaggia caraibica"
"My wife and I were wanting to PURCHASE a local excursion package.  If you see people on the streets of Tulum or in retail 'huts' appearing to sell excursion packages - they aren't.  They are feeders for Zuma Residence club where you will spend over 90 minutes being sold a membership.  I am not complaining about the property (although the rooms are small - no more than 4 can stay in any room on the property and have absolutely ZERO view.  My poor rating is due to their sketchy sales tactics.  They say the ""p"
" required a reservation one day in advance.).  Zuma will likely blame the contractor that 'sold' the package, but that would be expected of them.  The entire pitch is scripted and I'm sure the contractors are provided the sales training.    Unless you have a small family and don't care about a view or being near a nice beach or walking distance to restaurants and shopping skip this altogether.    Book your excursions through a reputable source - not the guys on the street.  Here's how you know... ""Packages"""
"We couldnt find the hotel in the first place. The person said they were overbooked and could help. Then she said that the account in the website was duplicated and they didnt have our reservation. Then they offered another alternative but never called us, thinking that we ""should"" communicate via whatssapp at all times. We spoke with 3 different persons and no one seemed to know what was going on. DO NOT BOOK ANY PARK LANE IN TULUM OR THE AREA! ITS A SCAM!"
I tried to cancel our reservation a few days ahead of time and they refused to refund even $1 out of $1100USD paid. On top of that they were incredibly rude and lacked any sort of manners or common courtesy. STAY AWAY.
"Such a cute little home for our seven days stay, and we didn't want to leave.  Mayela is a wonderful lady, who offers up great advice on life, Tulum, and the history of the place.  We had a great kitchen to cook in, which is fantastic when you are on a budget, we even had a coffee machine. This was a great place to relax and unwind for a week."
"Our room had an odd smell, rain dripped through the roof and there were many bugs. We've never met the owner who probably could have helped us to solve the problems. So we stood for three days in a hut with a wet bed, with bugs in it and an ugly odd smell. After these three days all our clothes were wet due to the air humidity and had the same odd smell."
Our trip to Tulum became a nightmare due to three days rain and this little hut. Since we arrived the hut had an odd smell and water sipped down from the roof to our bed and our backpacks. The floor was covered with puddles and the bowls and we put pots there to catch the water. We really would have liked to talk to the owner but there where no one except from us. In the evening we were offered an othe hut which smelled even worse and it was very dirty but seemed to be dry. Nonetheless water sipped through 
 housekeeper to get the costs of the last night refund which is a joke when you additionally pay 20US$ for a cleaning fee. And the bungalow was dirty from the beginning   We've never seen the owner and met the housekeeper who just could speak rudimentally english foraybe three times. We were so happy when we left. We had to wash ALL the clothes even those we didn't use because of the smell.

"Set a couple of blocks back from the main street and close to the bus station, these two cabins make for an unusual stay.  The palapas themselves are basic, quite small space wise and the build standard is a bit shoddy in places but as a base where you spend little time it does the job. Very relaxed staff and room wasn't cleaned, bins emptied etc in the two days. We were charged more than we thought we'd be paying but still ok in terms of value."
"The cooking staff was friendly, but that’s where it ends. I brought a group to celebrate my 40th birthday. We were looking forward to a relaxing, zen-filled vacation just 5 minutes outside of the beach clubs and restaurants in Tulum, as Playaakun advertises. Instead, we arrived to a 45 minute (not 5) pothole filled drive to the home. Our heads hit the roof of the car at least 60 times – no exaggeration. The 1.5 mile ride took 45 minutes each time we went to/from town. I was concerned about safety in the Tul"
" multiple discussions, the owners of the house (Ruta Uleviciute and Claudio Catanzaro) took zero responsibility for the lack of security and emotional stress this put on our group. I will never go back to this property. If you are considering renting Playaakun feel free to reach out to me – I’m happy to give you more specifics and answer any questions."
"El hostal está a cuadras de la Terminal de bus ADO, las habitaciones son sencillas y limpias. El personal amable, bien dispuesto, me brindo la información necesaria para moverme en la zona. La relación precio servicio es perfecta."

"I booked through Hotels.com. Afterwards, I received a confirmation email listing the address and contact info for this listing. However, when we arrived in Tulum, there was nothing located at this address. We searched several neighborhoods and were unable to find it.   As we searched, we spoke with neighboring businesses. No one had heard of this place. Several tried to call on our behalf using the contact info. No answer.  Throughout our 5-day stay, we tried to make contact with this hotel. No one ever pic"
"The photos look nice, but we came there and were shocked to see the standard of the huts for the really high price they had already charged us. There are two huts with no comfort, the bathrooms don’t have good standard. The location is not safe and there was no security. We didn’t want to stay there, explain to them the reasons, but we didn’t get that money back.."
"Nous sommes restés 10 jours à casa balam. étant les seuls occupant de casa balam il est possible que nous ayons vécu l'expérience différemment. Tout d'abord l'hôtel est excentré de tulum, vers la riviera tulum, ce qui peut être un inconvénient. des vélo sont mis a disposition gratuitement, mais cela peut faire quand même assez loin d'autant plus que les plages ne sont pas proche du centre ville de tulum (15/20min en voiture). après l'hôtel en lui même est très rustique, porte qui ferme avec un cadenas, peti"
"Das war ein Betrug. Jemand hat Hotel Namens Hacienda Isabel (o.ä.) unter dem Namen Mexican Hacienda in Booking.com eingegeben. Wahrscheinlich ohne Bookings Wissens. Wenn wir da kamen (28.12. in der Nacht), hat alles gestimmt, Adresse, Lage, die Bilder aus Internet waren das, was da auch wirklich stand. Nur Hotelsname und unsere Reservierung nicht. Böse Überraschung. Gott sei Dank, mit Booking.com haben wir die Sache (aus grösserem Teil) erledigt. Aber trotzdem - VORSICHT - dieses Hotel NICHT BUCHEN!!!"
"Smells, it's gross. Feels like you're in a jail cell because there are no windows in room. It was very disgusting and felt very unsafe. We left the next day and went to LHotelito next door for a couple more bucks. Don't put your self at risk to save a couple dollars. "
"It may look like a basic great hotel - but what is basic nowadays for our human comfort - Hotel Las Ruinas - has it - AC - King Size Bed - clean bathrooms - when in Tulum - let no one impress you on any better deal -  accessibility to a restaurant, money exchange, parking, souvenir shops, all necesities for your comfort - a laundry - bike rentals motorcycle rentals tours etc etc "
The rooms are very very basic but we did not expect any frills. However the hotel is located next door to a nightclub and we have not slept all night!!! Thank God the owners were very nice and they accepted that we stay for 2 nights instead of the 6 nights we have booked without being charged. For the same price one can find much better hotels in town.
"Difficile decidere da cosa partire. Prima cosa, non è un vero hotel ma un bungalow in un ""giardino"" privato, privo di indicazioni ed insegne e sorvegliato da cani quasi sempre liberi. L'unico accesso alla strada viene chiuso con un lucchetto di cui non si può avere la chiave custodita gelosamente da un ragazzo che dorme in un'amaca in giardino. L'altro accesso arriva direttamente sulla spiaggia dell'hotel di lusso a fianco, dal quale si deve necessariamente passare se si vuole rientrare in stanza. Ovviament"

"Mi pareja y yo visitamos  Tulum a inicios del mes de septiembre  y estaríamos por dos días. Al llegar nos recibió un hombre de nombre Gabriel , quien dijo ser el administrador,  manifestó  que la habitación reservada (con dos meses de anterioridad) no estaba disponible debido a que tenía una filtración de agua,  nos ofreció  disculpas y  expreso que al día siguiente nos ubicaría  en ella, que esa  noche solo estaba disponible una habitación en el primer piso a mano derecha, sin otra opción y sin mayor probl"

"La prima stanza che ci hanno fornito era molto spaziosa ed elegante con un design minimal, ma la doccia erogava pochissima acqua e ci hanno assegnato una stanza meno accogliente, ma con una doccia funzionante.  Prezzo della camera abbastanza contenuto, ma ho pagato per una stanza grande e ho usufruito di una più piccola. La posizione è abbastanza defilata, in una strada sterrata priva di servizi. Va bene solo per chi ha un'auto, a che perché la struttura non offre bici. la piscina è bella in foto, ma l'acqu"
"DON'T visit this hotel!  At arrival on the 8th of August the hotel offered me a better price than my original reservation via booking. We agreed to cancel the Booking reservation and I paid the new total with my creditcard at the hotel.  I noticed that the other creditcard payment via Booking was still blocked and also collected by the hotel. After notifiying the hotel manager about the double payment I was expecting an apology and of course a refund of one of my two payments.  Instead, this hotel manager C"
" Disrespectful, but above all, how stupid can you be as a manager of your hotel.  After asking them and warning several times I had to call the police to fix this situation. Calling the police was also my only option to get Carlos to come to his OWN hotel. Because at this moment (from 8:00 a.m. untill 15:00 p.m. he was still too busy and refusing to pick up his phone while we were waiting to get our money back and start enjoying our holiday.    An half hour after the police arrived we saw a man coming in wh"
"Poor customer service, the staff stole money out of our room. After we notified the owners they still charged us extra for the safety box. Dirty towels and the sheets had holes in them. Cockroaches under the beds. The owners woke us up in the middle of the night because they had forgot to give us a key for our friend who arrived a few days after us."
The room I was staying in had no lights and in 4 nights my room wasn't cleaned once. I wouldn't recommend this Hotel as there are many other options. 5min away from downtown and 15min from the beach!!
"Hotel Tulum is located in the center of Tulum with a 5 min drive to the beach! The rooms are nice and clean with high ceilings, hot water, wifi and air conditioning. The garden outside is beautiful and so is the architecture of the house.  The owners are very friendly and gives a very personal service. It feels like you are invited into their home. They were very helpful with any question we had and made very nice breakfast! Overall a super place to stay and very cheap comparing to other same quality hotels"
"The owners, mother and daughter Veronica and Veronica, are very kind and have shown me their way of life here in Tulum. They have offered me some delicious Chilean and traditional maya food in great quantities and whenever I want to eat they provide me with something. There is plenty of fruit and fresh ingredients which give a healthy family atmosphere. I have a double bed and private bathroom all for 150 pesos which is one of the cheapest hostels around. It is slightly dirty but I don't mind too much.  Ano"
"The worst place i have ever stayed! Really, i wish that night never existed. Very dirty and messy hotel in general. Talking about room, still want to cry - dirty linen with hair, sand and spots on it. Uncomfortable bed, dirty towel (just one for 2 person), no hot water, bugs in the room and the smell was so awfull, can not tell in words. So stay away from this place!!! "
"This place is a dodgy rip off with torn sheets, dirty towels and cucarachas in the shower!   We ended up here out of pure desperation as during the high season nothing else was available. We booked it online, but upon arrival, we were told that due to an overbooking our room was no longer available. Our only other option was to stay in a room for triple the price. We had no other option but to agree.The room was absolutely not worth it!  5 min later I witnessed the receptionist telling the same filthy lie t"
"They asked to pay the whole amount as we arrived and they informed us that no complain was admitted (regarding sheets, water missing, animals in the room...). Quite strange. Towels were missing and finally they gave us towels that smelled bad and had spots. It was quite clear that they were already used. The sheets were dirty and there was sand in my bed. We found a roach (cucaracha!) in our room. I know they are not dangerous but I prefer not to see them sneaking under my bed.  What else? Drain didn't work"
"This is one of the dirtiest hotel I've stayed in. Unfortunately we arrived in Tulum without a reservation during high season and ended up at this place. The only room they had left was something more of a closet with a broken door which had to be locked with a chain and padlock. There were cigarette buts and hair laying around in the room. The sheets were dirty and since it's right next to the highway and had no fan or AC it was really noisy. The shared bathroom had no electricity, toilet paper or trashbin "
"Nothing to add to the title. I cannot find any reasons why one should stay at this hotel. Stinky and mouldy rooms, dirty sheets and pillows, rude people at the reception. Our fault was to get to Tulum without reservation but at this conditions fat better to sleep on the shore!"
In hindsight we would have taken our time to find somewhere else. The place needs a decent clean up and the initial service we got was average. Our room was adequate with plenty of faults and the club out the back ensured we got a bad nights sleep.
"Pésima experiencia   Llegamos en tiempo y forma y no había nadie que tuvieron que salir a una emergencia   Al día siguiente al bañarnos sorpresa el agua es salada! No es agua potable! Imposible bañarse ahí 🤨   Además el cuarto muy sucio... no había nadie ni ni día ni noche cuando según hay j. Encargado! Pero como es domingo pues descansan y entonces pues no lo renten!!!  Llegamos el lunes en la noche y no limpiaron  el cuarto y horas en recepción y ninguna respuesta!  Pésimo servicio, limpieza súper pobre, "
"We only stayed here for two nights after reading much better reviews on Expedias website.   There was some confusion at check in as I had not been contacted to advise on how to check in as reception is not all day, though once I had wifi I was able to call the hotel and they instructed me in.   The location is out of the way its within residential areas, though if you have a car hire you'd be fine. We didn't but on our journey to town we caught a taxi and took their what's app number and he would come to co"
 a wardrobe area and little seating area. The bed was huge and the bathroom (though our door didn't close fully) was good with a very powerful and warm shower.  All in all I would recommend to anyone just to be aware of the location.
"This place could be great but lack some care Staff is stressing, noone at front desk when we got there first Phone number not in function Cancellation difficult if mot impossible Wish they shake up and make it great"
"Staff was rude, DRUNK, and aggresive. The property was dark and unkept. As a solo female traveller i felt slightly unsafe.  After ringing the bell for 5 minutes finally a man arrived, he smelled and acted drunk. He claimed to not have received my reservation for a dorm bed, and claimed that he had no more dorms left so put me in a private room. The room was barely a basic level of clean, the towel did not look clean at all. The rest of the property was very dark and unkept. I was told to never go by the mai"
" available and another person said it was not available. Lots of confusing information was being thrown around and they were quoting different prices each time, the entire time they are being rude and demanding and impatient. I managed to negotiate with the lady a price to stay in the private room. Then the man, who was now even more drunk than before, got angry at me because I allegedly agreed to pay a much higher price beforehand (i never did). He was slurring his words and cursed at me. At no point durin"
"i made a reservation and already paid the hostel, when i arrived there was no one there. in the morning i went there and a man informed me that the hostel was closed since 2 month. when i contacted the owner he didnt respond."
"We stayed 2 times in this hotel. The first stop was somewhat ok. They don’t provide any normal blankets, the towels and sheets are very old and worn out with old stains on it. The second time was a complete disaster. The room was filthy, the floors were completely dirty. The bathroom was so dirty and humid that my husband did not want to take a shower in it. The toilet bowl was not cleaned. It was only one night so we had to deal with it. Please avoid this place."
"I was very happy to stay at Casa Babel, they had just opened a few days ago and were very friendly. Amenities are what you need for your stay, water pressure is great, WiFi works, the bar is cool and small pool great to hang out around! My favorite point: pet friendly! Both my cat and my dog were nicely welcome."

"We stayed at Casa Babel for 4 nights, from the moment we arrived it was terrible.  Our room had ants, when we addressed the problem to staff we were told there was nothing could be done..  Our linen was dirty, no hot water (which wasn’t a major problem for us as it was hot)  But several times there was no water at all. Couldn’t even brush our teeth, once again staff not helpful at all and was told “oh well that’s México” which is total crap as we have stayed in many hostels around Mexico and have never come"
 wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.   
"Un buon appartamento pulito vicino la zona con negozi, bar e ristoranti. C'è tutto quello che serve, buon rapporto qualità/prezzo Il proprietario è stato gentile, disponibile, educatissimo. Io e la mia compagna arrivati a Cancun ci siamo subito diretti a Tulum, qui ci siamo fermati solo una notte, il giorno seguente visita alle rovine maia e poi in partenza per Merida"
"It is the worst room i have ever been. The area is dangerous. We are afraid to come back late at night. The room, bathroom and sheets  had an awful smell. That's why we were the omly residents in the whole building! We visited Tulum only for two days and unfortunatelly didn't have the time to find something else. I think that soon this place will close... Stay only at the beach area and you will definately enjoy your trip to lovely Tulum!"
"Our entire 4 day stay without a working toilet!  Had to go to restaurants nearby for the bathroom.  The noisiest place you will ever stay,  We have two rooms and the same problems in both rooms.  The owner failed to mention there is still construction on this building and the building next door.  The work starts at 7am and goes til almost 9pm.  Then you have the barking dogs all night.  To boot, the toilet hasn't worked since we checked in.  I've asked 3 times to have it fixed to no avail.  Then you have a "
" shower floor which was stepped on and punctured a foot.  Not fine.  The water pressure is non existent so we have been showering at the hotel a some guy we met on the beach is staying.   STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.  There are way better places for the money.  Check the other reviewers who gave this place a good rating, they are not real reviews."
"Amazing beach!!! Quiet and relaxing scenery. Crystal clear blue water, warm too. Great margaritas. Pricey chairs and massage service (the advertised price is for a regular massage) but great customer service, they accept card for this. Bar doesn't accept card. They also provide glamping (I didn't do this). "
"Las palmas glamping.   The location is super nice.   The stretch of beach right outside is nice and sandy and not too crowded (further down there is a short stretch with rocks, where you can't access the beach directly). That about it though.  For me it was amazing being able to wake up and walk directly to the beach without thinking about packing a bag and prepare for a day at the beach. That luxury makes up for a lot in my book.  What i do think you have to consider before choosing this place is:  - there"
" This also means that there is no wifi until 18pm. I have been sleeping with earplugs and for me it was actually enough to get a good night sleep.  The bathrooms are also dark during day time, almost no light enters when you close the toilet door.   - last night we came home around 3 in the night and the port to the camping was closed. We have at no time been informed that there will be limited access to the camp after a certain hour. Vi had to pass through another hotel and walk along the dark beach at nig"

"Wir waren 2 Tage auf Rundreise in Tulum und haben diesen tollen Geheimtipp entdeckt. Die Zimmer sind super geräumig und haben eine eigne Küche mit großem Kühlschrank, Kaffee und Kochuntensilien. Außerdem bieten die Zimmer eine sauberes Bad. Auf dem Dach findet sich eine sehr gemütlich Dachterrasse. Das Stadtzentrum mit seinen vielen Kaffees und Bars ist keine 10 Minuten zu Fuß entfernt. "
Llegamos al hotel y estuvo todo bien pero luego de 30 minutos empezamos a escuchar que picaban y a ver mucho polvo... habían tenido un imprevisto y rompieron toda la entrada del hotel hasta la cloaca... todo el día escuchamos ruido y tuvimos que soportar todo el polvo... y el hotel no tuvo ni medio gesto por los problemas ocasionados... El baño estaba sucio... la ducha con miles de círculos en el vidrio donde se apoya el shampoo de viejos ya usados... mugre en el piso de la bañadera... Cuando pedimos shampo
 habitación es linda!!!  No nos dieron shampoo pero si nos dieron agua...

"the worst hotel that i had stayed a lot of mosquito ,2 roaches in the room , dark room . when i complained he acted as he didn't understand me . Never ever again even they give me a complimentary stay."
"Me and a friend booked this place because it was the cheapest available on the beach and it made our entire trip a nightmare.  I don't even think it's a real hotel - the people that work there speak broken English and Carlos, the kid who runs the place lives above the open-air lobby.  They use a 3rd-party cleaning service and the owner is never there. Carlos gave us an upper room on the side next to a property that was under construction and there was a platform along side our room that someone easily used "
" next door ourselves it was useless because they couldn't speak English.  Given we were leaving the next day and had other plans it was useless to call the cops and we got the hell out of there and stayed in the city that night and moved on - all the way to Merida to get an expedited Passport.  Carlos has an honest face and speaks very good English but only when he needs to, otherwise suddenly his English isn't very good when there's a problem. Anyway - this is the type of place you'll be staying in if you "
"They sell it under different names over Airbnb. Very basic and very small cabanas. The ""double"" bed was too small for a 1,85m guy.   We paid 150$ per night. It was worth 10$!   Positive: beautiful view from the balcony and nice beach.  "
"Absolutely disgusting!  Filthy dirty, smelled like urine a JOKE of a hotel/cabana.  The desk clerk/owner couldn't find any keys for the room; it's horrible that they are even in business.  Very shady and scary - wouldn't spend a night there.  We immediately called a different hotel and left El Caracol.  Hotels.com better make sure do drop this property!  NOT a double bed.  I've stayed in some crappy places over our 25 years of traveling the Yucatan coastline and this is by far the worst experience we've eve"
"To start, bug infested and disgusting. The floor was dirty, bathroom was dirty and we never had fresh towels or enough toilet paper. Didn't have wifi (like they advertise) and poor customer service. We found a new hotel the next day and got out of there."
"To keep it short and simple, the staff was horribly rude, the rooms were DISGUSTING and they had a bug problem. There was no wifi despite their claims, and there were cockroaches everywhere. When is rained, our room leaked. We never had enough towels or toilet paper and nobody was ever around to help us. This was the grossest hotel ive ever stayed at, hands down. My hotel in Haiti was nicer, no joke."
"Ok... Went to Tulum, had to stay a few nights, had no reservations, found this place. For what you're payin, it's not that bad. 180.00 for a beach front cabana w/AC (at night) the views are amazing and if ya really feel the need, bring some clean sheets and pillow cases... Maybe we got lucky cause ours were fine. No weird smells or anything like I read in another review. Beach front on a budget.... Nothin more... nuthin less."
We were attracted by the cheap rate that he had posted on the sandwich board outside. And the initial excitement over the amazing view quickly dissolved when we noticed a strange smell from the septic tank was filtering into the room. We couldn't get rid of it for the duration of our stay - It lasted the whole time we were there and made it very challenging to even sleep but we had no choice as we had paid upfront. The manager was never there to help out with any questions.  We had to ask for toilet paper a
 place.
…
Stayed here when we got into tulum without a hotel reserved for first night. The balcony view of the beach was the only redeeming thing about this place. Pretty much anything else that could be wrong with a hotel room was.   There were several dead Mosquitos on our bed sheets and pillows when we arrived. Holes and stains in mosquito net. Weird red stains on pillows. I pray it was just chili sauce. There was a spider web in the light above the bed.We ran to the supermarket - bought two cans of bug spray- and
 their property at all.    I'd tell everyone to steer clear unless you get a severe discount on a beach front room like we did - and don't mind dirt/squalor.  
"I booked a stay at Mistiq for me and three other friends for July 9th-July 12th. Upon arrival, the receptionist was very kind and welcoming. As we were checking in, we overheard another guest mentioning that there is no electricity and had to leave because she needed to work on her computer. We had to pry for more information from the receptionist and learned that they did not have AC OR RUNNING WATER. We were already tired from our day of traveling and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and felt "
" after midnight to a hotel with both. After going back and forth with Mistiq they attempted at winning us back with dinner vouchers. What a joke. Finally got a refund/will never step foot on Mistiq again. Also note, they are far from all of the restaurants and bars. Not a good location at all."

"The good: It is a small and pretty property, the staff was nice and helpful (particularly Eric). Complimentary breakfast was decent, eggs, bacon, toast, and fruit salad with tea or coffee. and Iloved the fact that there was no TV in the room. The bad: at that price range, in that area, you expect more than what was offered. I did not get the room that was booked as the beautiful crochet headboard was missing, the room did not have a safe and it had to be installed on request. The tap water was a tad bit sal"
 from the popular restaurants.
…
"Dishonest people. first, they give you a price and then when you leave, they ask you to pay extra for the cleaning service and electricity even if in the contract it says that it's included. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
From the bathroom to the room and the kitchen - everything is in very bad shape. It's not dirty but definitely not as clean as it should be. The only thing that works is the pretty fast WiFi. Location is also a plus.
"i read the terrible reviews so i felt compelled to write about my great experience staying at una noche mas for several days.  first off, this is mexico.  and this is a mexican owned hostel.  and it's also the cheapest accomodations in pricey tulum.  given that, if you're high maintenance, this isn't the place for you.  if you're an easy going backpacker, this is more your cup of tea.  my expectations/standards are based on my 2+ years of travel through panama, costa rica, nicaragua and mexico.  i've stayed"
"The price is pretty low but you can definitely do better in the pueblo for the money with some shopping around.  The place isn't terrible and we've certainly stayed in worse but it's just alot of little things are below standard. Probably the worst thing about it was that it is an especially noisy place. On the positive side it was a clean place, gotta give it that."
"We arived late in tulum. A Girl was advertising at the ADO-station do we fell for it.  The staff was friendly at first sight. But after checking in they went back to there student-drinking business.  So after checking in we went up to make up out beds in the main. After we tried to get some sleep. Before turning off the light i saw a bed bug walking arround on the bed next to me, and after some Hood looking also in my bed.  We immediatly packed our stuff and head downstairs to tell the staff.

 sleep is in my tent on the beach.    so onto my experience at una noche mas - i camped on the rooftop which is a mix of storage/laundry drying/sometimes a hangout.  i don't recommend it during the wet season which is what i did.  but i only had 1 day with torrential downpours where i literally had a river run through my tent and the other nights were warm and breezy enough that i stayed several more nights.  ceasar let me keep my valuables in the lockers in the women's dorm. - the common bathrooms were cle

"Don't try to find the HAH Hostel in Tulum - they have no place and their pin on the Google map is just misleading. Nobody around has heard about them in this place... Don't try to call them looking for the property - I tried, they just had insult me so, I went elsewhere... No place for this place in Tulum :/"
"A decent place to stay, it's a little warn down and needs a little love and a bit of a clean in places but it's a good little stop over if you want to spend a night or 2 in Tulum, it's only a 30 second walk from the bus station and everything else is on your doorstep!  You can hire bikes at reception for 80 pesos for a day!  At 300 per night it was a decent deal for a private room and bathroom! "
"Arrived in Tulum earlier than expected on the ADO bus (4.30am). Hostel is next to the bus station which is convenient. Very comfy bed and very clean rooms. We paid 350 for a private room with bathroom.   Negatives:  No towels were available as ""this is a hostel"".  After checking out we were told to leave the property and were not allowed to use the wifi, a bit strange. "
Informal hostel.  Big kitchen available for your use.  Pool table.  I used the tent option which I enjoyed.  It even rained pretty hard the first night but my tent kept me dry.  Air bed in the tent was comfy. They have other options besides the tents. People are friendly.  Kind of a family atmosphere.  Wifi was good.  Hot water not always available but the cold water isn't freezing.  It is about 3 blocks off the main drag so quiet by comparison.  Breakfast included and free coffee. I don't think you can bea

"we stumbled into this place to get out of the rain (its super close to the bus station) and ended up staying for lack of a better idea. our mattress was comfortable, but filthy, the sheets didnt fit the bed. there was a stand alone fan which was excellent in cooling our room the bathroom was also filthy - pubic hairs in/around the toilet, showers not clean, bathrooms not cleaned in the 24hrs we were there kitchen looked well enough equipped ok for the night, but i wouldn't (and didn't) stay longer"

"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights. We paid 300 pesos per night for a private room with a bathroom and a ceiling fan.  We stayed on the 3 floor in room number 30 and had to keep the door open most of the time just to keep the air flowing as it does get very hot (it is worse in lower floors).  Staff members were always at the reception if we needed anything and it felt safe.  Location is also very good, and is close to everything you need.   mosquitoes are abundant and are a pain in the butt so come prep"
" decorated and very warm home feel (take advantage of this!). The pool is a great addition that I wasn't expecting, and they can rent you bikes to move around the small and beautiful town/almost city of Tulum. The hammocks upstairs are delicious and I hope can be preserved since they're delicate and fragile. The pool table in the living room is also the best little surprise ever! Not to mention the fact that the big led screen in front of it is smart and if you know how to use it you have infinite apps [Net"
"Although this hostel is very cheap and the owner is very nice, it's one of the worst hostels I've seen. In general everything looks very dirty and the shower is one drop at the time, so hair washing for a girl is almost an imposible mission. Fortunately, I only needed to crash for a few hours till my bus departed at midnight, but I don't think anyone can stay there more than a day."
"I was just looking for a place to stay for one night,and walking on the main drag in tulum you could here the reggae and other funky music playing on the third floor rooftop terrace/bar, so I decided to check it out and it's definitely worth the 190MEX. I arrived a little early (1pm) and the super helpful guy at the front desk let me stash my pack until check in at 3.(even after I destroyed his mop job with my dirty pennyboard wheels😂!Sorry bout that!!) I would recommend this place for its laid back atmosph"
"Ci siamo fermati 9 notti, l'accoglienza è stata superlativa, lo staff disponibilissimo. L'ostello dispone di camere da 6/8 posti in letti a castello con bagni condivisi e dotate di ventilatori e di camere doppie con ventilatore, condizionatore e bagno privato. La colazione è un po' scarna, ma il cucinino è dotato di tutta l'attrezzatura necessaria e sufficiente per prepararsi qualcosa da soli, compresi pranzo e cena. Gli spazi comuni sono molto ampi e al piano superiore c'è una grande terrazza, in parte cop"
"El lugar es sucio, improvisado, a las personas que trabajan acá (a excepción de la chica que administra) no les importa su trabajo, ni dar información ni ayudarte. Está lejos de todo. Solo dos baños, siempre sucios. No volvería para nada."
"300 pesos for a room with a fan, 400 more for air condition, but be sure to pick one of the rooms with an outside view, as the others will have venilation (and mould) problems. However, the (very friendly) staff does everything to keep the place clean. ADO and nighttime stores just a few steps away, good food options right at your doorstep. And be sure to take a cab or a bike to the stunning beach."
"Great location in the middle of town, cheapest accomidation in the city. 6-8 beds per room, few outlets that are near the ceiling, paper thin sheets, lumpy pillows, friendly staff. The tiny upstairs shared kitchen is the only common area, not very comfortable for socializing. They do bike rentals for 60 pesos as well. If you just need a place to sleep, this is it, if you want more of a social life, lounge, reliable wifi, look elsewhere. For the ultra cheap, they allow you to camp on the roof for half the co"
"Benefits: Hostel was based in a central location. Bikes could be hired from this hostel for 100 pesos. Lockers are provided in the bedroom - You just have to bring your own lock. Power sockets are available by bed.   Beware: * We booked for a 10 bedroom dorm but was placed in a dorm which connected to another dorm of 20 beds altogether, all sharing one bathroom set (toilet and shower).  * Hostel advertised hot water however water was cold. * This is a party hostel whereby the music plays from the rooftop an"
"ho soggiornato qui durante la ""semana santa"", l'ostello era pieno, quindi per un totale di 18 persone più il personale con un unico bagno!! manca un pò di cura esterna e la colazione variabile, un giorno buona il giorno dopo scadente."
I have been to this hotel twice. It is local run and so cheap and clean. It is not listed anywhere and is just great. A short walk from the ADO bus station. There is everything you need within 500 m. There is always spmeone at the front dppr so you knpw it is safe.
Okay so we had a room with basically no walls. The ceiling was made of plastic and room barely fit the bed. Our stay started with a one hour wait for the owner to even get a key to the room! We did not want to leave our baggage unattended. This is not a hostel for anyone with ears since the walls are non-existent and therefore extremely noisy.
"I’ve stayed in a lot of hostels, and this one gets the title of The Worst. There is zero security (not even keys to the room), it is not clean, our room was meant to have 12 people but had 23 (including a mattress laid on the ground), and the rooftop bar played incredibly loud music until 4 a.m., so no sleep was possible. We originally booked two nights here but left after one because of how absolutely terrible it was. Do not stay here."
"The location is nice , on the beach. They charge you 15% for service even if it is not great( the lady speaks 0 English). There will be an extra fee also if you pay by card ...like a punishment! So be prepared to pay some extra money besides the already big prices they practice. "
"I paid for six nights, but could only stay four. Part of that was not the hostel's fault--someone staying in my shared room had contracted dengue fever in Cuba, and I didn't want to risk getting it. That said, the hostel staff did nothing to alert or warn guests, even those like me who had already paid in full. I didn't expect a refund, but a ""hey, this is something you should know about and these are the steps we are taking to prevent transmission"" would have been nice.  Anyways, that's unlikely to affect "
"2 night stay and was charged $176. Disgusting accommodations, dirty towels, no cleaning service, loud, and no discount for even eating at the restaurant and being a guest. The staff is super nice but this place feels like a Mexican prison at a 4 star price."
Only stay at this place if you like noise!  There is a live DJ all day from 9am to 22hrs or later blaring music non-stop from the beach bar.  For accomodation you have a choice of camping or beach cabins.  The cabins are basic to the max - and way over-priced for what you get.   The ground floor cabins consist of a mattress in the middle of sand so you might as well camp for a third of the price!   The upstairs cabins have a wooden floor at least....but not much else.  The mattresses are old and sagging and
Staff are amazingly nice. Nice breakfast when booked with booking.com.  Large room and kitchenette.. but way too muggy and warm to not have a/c. And between 60-70 dollars for it just isnt really worth it. Nice to be close to the supermarket and if you rent a bike its a 3-4km bikeride to the beach or ruins.  
"We had such a nice time in Tulum! This condo is in Aldea Zama, a very trendy and safe area. About. 10 minute and enjoyable bike ride to the beach. Lots of great shops and restaurants and cafes in the area. Quinto Sol felt very safe and clean. Definitely recommend."
"AVOID AT ALL COST - WORST PLACE EVER.  RENTED THIS PLACE FROM MIKITITO RENTALS. RATING: 0/100 Where sould I start... First, the electricity would work ON and OFF which means that in the middle of the night, the AC stops and that would happen serval times a day. Same for everything else including internet and the fridge... So forget about working remotely there or simply staying there a few days. When I mentioned that to the property manager she said that I was lying. When the A/C would suddendly start worki"
"we stayed in cabana 4, I'm actually writing this review from the hammock on the front porch.  totally worth the $80 dollars, no ac and the bed is small but you are on one of the best stretches of beach.  If you are a pretty self sufficient traveler this is the place for you.  word of warning, don't take their loaner bike unless you are ready to make repairs on the go.  Alberto is one of the friendliest guys in mexico, we expect to see turtles nesting in front of our cabana tonight.... seriously awesome."
"Hostal simples e limpo.  Próximo à estação de ônibus (15 min caminhando), aos restaurantes e à rua principal onde se pegam as vans para as Ruinas e Cenotes. Conseguimos um quarto para quatro pessoas, com um banheiro externo exclusivo Pessoas na recepção bem simpáticas."
"Hostal muy bien ubicado, a un paso de la calle principal, con tiendas y restaurantes. El patio es hermoso y agradable.   Camas cómodas y las atenciones de Roberto y el equipo excepcionales.   Me encantó hospedarme allí."
"Piccolo hostal nel pueblo di Tulum, solo 3 stanze, dove affittare un letto, tutte le stanze hanno il bagno privato, connessione wi-fi gratuita, la pulizia è impeccabile sia nelle stanze che nelle parti comuni. La zona è stupenda, si affaccia su di un piccolo parco, proprio davanti si ferma il collettivo per la spiaggia (passa ogni 10 minuti), proprio di fronte troverete La Parillada, il miglior ristorante di carne di Tulum, 3 minuti a piedi siete nel centro, 5 minuti alla stazione dei bus ADO."
"When I was checking out from this hostel, Roberto the son demanded that I paid him 300 pesos (US$15!) for the diminutive pillow case that I did not take. I am sure there was no this item on my bed initially, when I arrived here yesterday in the afternoon. All my efforts to convince Roberto that this is not my fault were ignored. Next time, said Roberto, check your bed more attentively. When I answered that there will be no next time, Roberto accused me on the aggressiveness and told that he’s going to call "
"El lugar se encuentra centricamente, alado hay una farmacia con servicio medico y del otro costado una cafetería.  Cuenta con aire acondicionado, y la atención por parte de los encargados fue buena y amable, como nuestro autobús salía un par de horas después del check out, la encargada nos guardó nuestras maletas. En el baño, limpio solamente que no tenía cortina la ventana, tuvimos que improvisar con la toalla de lo contrario todos nos verían desde afuera. Al estar rodeado de la vida nocturna de Tulúm, hay"
I took my kids (9 and 10) on their first paddle boarding adventure. The guy that was manning the school for the day was awesome. He was friendly and helpful and got us in the water with some instructions as we were determined to try it ourselves alone. A freak storm came in and whisked us out to sea a bit and he was right there with a friend to help us back in...I don't know what we would have done with out him! His paying attention to us saved us. The sea is usually very calm and so peaceful-this was a rar
 futuro en mi visita a Tulúm.
" ""locals"" pricing. Its expensive to be an expat these days!"
We found this charming place while walking to the beach and fell in love with the comfort and decor.   The staff is European and very knowledgeable about where and when to go sightseeing.  The back of the house leads to a secret lagoon with a beautiful cenote.  We loved the place so much we stayed an extra week.
…
"Very nice stay at Nero di Sole. Aircon room was reasonable for the  area (550 pesos), cleaned daily, very nice friendly staff and perfect location on the main road, 5 mins walk from the bus station. The aircon could have been more effective though!"
"Noisy all night, no upkeep at all, disgusting kitchen, ripped sheets, open electrical wires, we planned on a week, left after one night and our staying in a clean, organized quiet hostel two blocks away from this one that is the same price."
"Este hotel es una pura estafa. Se rompió el boiler a la 1 de la manana mientras dormíamos, dejando nuestra habitación inundada y llena de humo. No solo nos asustamos muchísimo, sino que nos quedamos a la 1 de la manyana fuera de la habitación buscando al personal desesperadamente. Tras más de 10 intentos de llamar por teléfono fallidos, llega la duenya en un estado inaceptable y no nos da ninguna solución, montanto una escena de película, sin entender ni poder hablar una palabra. Tuvimos que coger maletas y"
"They will make you feel unwanted there as often as possible during your stay. They did it so often, it must be on purpose given the place is a freaking hostel. I felt really uncomfortable!! The price and place itself is okay-ish."
The hostel doesn't look like the pictures AT ALL. It is quite dirty and no privacy at all as there are no windows (so you hear everything from the common area) and as half of the hostel goes through your dorm room while you are sleeping to have a shower.   There were also no lockers available.   The atmosphere is nice and the location too but don't go there if you want any sleep
"Nice people,nice place always with shadow and chill.the dorms are spacey and and every day was cleaned by a really nice lady.Charly the owner of the hostel is always around and more than willing to give you the best up to date information about everything!if you want some relaxing days in Tulum la cigana is the place! "
"El lugar es muy lindo y tranquilo, alejado de todo, espacios con diseños muy agradables y las camas son muy cómodas. La cocima está muy bien equipada y todo el personal muy atento y cordial.  Tiene un cenote (artificial), una pequeña poza y varias áreas comunes bastante agradables.  Sin embargo tuvimos problema con el aire acondicionado ya que utilizan celdas eléctricas y no es suficiente.  Ese detalle, que las albercas no se veían tan limpias y que el camino de acceso no es tan sencillo serían los únicos p"
"Beds are uncomfortable, the place is noisy and dirty, and the owner's cats get into rooms are beds (I ain't got nothing against cats in general, but they're dirty and one might be allergic). They try to give a cool or bohemian atmosphere to the hostel but is all fake and once you pay they don't care about you anymore. Breakfast is so bad, just the minimum to say they give breakfast included, but not any ""love"" in it. Since I was in Tulum during the high season, and it's really hard to find accomodation then"
"My group rented out the entire hotel (17 people) and it was perfect. It clean, comfortable, spacious and in a prime location for eating, drinking, parties and to just chill. It had a great outdoor rooftop common area where we could all hang out and eat in the little amount of time we spent at the hotel. Jaime (on-site) was super helpful when we needed and Anj (concierge) was very helpful in pre-trip arrangements and helping to ensure everything ran smoothly while in Tulum. Would definitely stay here again w"
" stay after they came straight form Cancún airport and they found that they had made overbooking with their beds. The worst part is that I also saw the owner, a guy from Mexico City, speaking and treating really bad to his workers, really bad, a huge lack of respect, like blackmailing them with their jobs. I THINK TRAVELERS SHOULDN'T SUPPORT THIS KIND OF BUSINESS."
…
"Nell'hotel Blazul sono stata tra i primi clienti e devo dire che ha un servizio ottimo, la receptionist aiuta con le informazioni di qualsiasi tipo e le camere hanno dei colori molto rilassanti, hanno tutto eccetto la televisione, che si abbinano perfettamente al mare che sta a pochi minuti di distanza, anche per  mangiare  ci si arriva comodamente  a piedi. E' vicino al centro e alla strada principale con negozi e bar. Sicuramente ci tornerò."
"Do not stay here. Well you couldn't even if you tried. Their management is a group of con men. We booked the Mojave 5 months fully paid and when we showed up to the door they informed there were no rooms, but they had rooms at their sister property the Amansala Resort 20 minutes away. It's pretty clear they are running a scam to get more people to stay 20 minutes away at Amansala. They are using the Mojave as a way to lure people into a trap, forcing them to stay at Amansala out of necessity when they are t"
"Construction zone! Dusty and noisy. Dining area filled with smokers! No area set aside for non-smokers! Smoke enters the bedrooms through the loosely fitted bamboo poles which serve as makeshift walls. Dining tables are right beside the sleeping quarters. Bright lights and noises were heard from guests throughout the night, which prevented me from getting a good night's rest. I couldn't wait to get out of there and look for a quiet hostel where I could at least breathe clean air in my bedroom! Not recommend"
 ruining their trip. They're an absolute disgrace.
"I stayed a couple of days without showers, there were dead cockroaches and many other running in the common area near the refigerador, bicycles for rent in very poor condition, very noisy at night. The manager does not know how to run a hostel coz volunteers are out of control.The only good thing were the pizzas but next door the service was much better. In 14 years traveling woldwide i never stayed in one hostel like this. not a good choice..."
…
"DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL, IT IS A SCAM. I’m not sure this place is even a real hotel. Came for a wedding and had 3 groups with booked rooms for at least 3 months in advance. They sent us emails asking if we wanted to “upgrade” to amansala which is no where near Mojave, So we said no. We arrived to the hotel to learn they don’t have a room for any of our reservations. 1 couple agreed to move to amansala and are now staying so far away from the action and their “upgrade” was a lie - Amansala is not a nice hotel"
"The first thing I would say about this hostel is that on the hostel bookers sight it appears to be on the beach, it isn't!!! Be aware that this hostel is in town.   Having said this the location is ok, next to a pretty cool cafe and mojito bar, although both are expensive.   Overall I was pretty disappointed with experience, my partner and I booked a private room which turned out to be opposite the hostel not in the hostel, it wasn't very clean, which is the biggest disappointment. It also has no hot water,"
" this again - DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL, IT IS A SCAM"
"stylisches zimmer mit ausreichend platz für zwei. an schlaf ist allerdings nicht vor morgens früh zu denken. es ist lauter als auf jeder baustelle. zudem kommt das wasser nur tröpfchenweise aus der dusche. dafür ist es einfach zu teuer! ich empfehle eine unterkunft ausserhalb der partymeile. wir haben leider für vier nächte gebucht, sind trotzdem nach der ersten nacht wieder ausgezogen.."
"Durch die guten Bewertungen bisher sowie einen Mangel an Alternativen, haben wir vier Nächte im Nest verbracht. Das Zimmer ist ausreichend groß für zwei Personen, das Bett ist wirklich bequem und auf dem Balkon gibt es eine Hängematte, soweit so gut.  Beim Frühstück hat meine eine Auswahl an einigen leckeren Gerichten, außerdem ist der House Manager William sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Leider stimmen die Details nicht, denn für über 100 Euro die Nacht ist es auch nicht gerade eine low-Budget Unterkunft"

Die Lautstärke  der Bars ist abends/nachts wirklich extrem, die Musik geht bis spät in die Nacht und das Zimmer ist schlecht isoliert, Ruhe findet man hier nicht, auch wenn netterweise schon Oropax zur Verfügung gestellt werden.  Insgesamt zu wenig Leistung für einen einigermaßen stolzen Preis."

"Located above popular cafe, Kibok on trendy Centaur Sur street in Tulum. William was a great host, was communicating with us the day before we turned up and was waiting for us when we got out of our cab from Chetumal.  Cafe downstairs is amazing and a great bonus with breakfast (hot dish and 1x coffee) included there!  Rooms are even more amazing than the pictures! The whole place is like a giant treehouse with a hammock on the very top to watch the sunset!  Lots of nightlife, which might not be so good if "
Great place to stay in the center of Tulum! They clean your room on request and you can get towels any time. They offer free water and coffee. The tv in the rooms was just reinstalled and the personnel is very helpful! 
"I cannot remember our guides name, but he was great! Very enjoyable! We got to swim and visit 3 cenotes, 20 minutes each. Bats were flying over head, it was awesome! I believe we paid $1100 pesos. There is supposed to be a Mayan ritual but we didn't get that, maybe because it was supposed to cost $1200 for two people. Great experience none the less."
"I recently had five nights booked at this hotel.  I spent the first night with a fan that barely worked, no hot water and no WiFi. The room is not as advertised in terms of it’s amenities and it does not look like it does in the photos. Adding to this, there was the constant smell of raw sewage that never seemed to dissipate and constant noise from construction and the road. One positive is that it is very conveniently located.   Making this stay worse, I discovered that a hurricane was projected to hit the"
"Es un lugar increíble en la Selva, súper agradable conocer a los guías son amables te explican muy bien! Y lo más importante admiras lo hermoso que es la naturaleza de ese lugar, recomiendo lleven repelente! Y alguna botana, agua para hidratarse! Y listos para emprender a la aventura🙂👍🏻"
it was peaceful and perfect for a couple! Excellent time for the adults to get away. Hotel was clean and the staff worked hard to ensure everyone enjoyed themselves. This place is very nice. I highly recommend this place.
"Our stay at Casa Aquamarine was amazing! The house is settled in a pristine beach, it has a beautiful view of the bay and the sand is literally steps from the pool area.  The house itself is very confortable, very well kept, modern, super clean, and in very good taste.  The keepers, Manuela and Salvador were very helpful and always ready to help us in any way we needed.  The house has kayaks easy to use and you can snorkel a few meters from the beach in front of the house.  It is the third time we stayed at"
" four days of my stay because it is a “non refundable booking” I think the circumstances call for one.   Avoid it at all costs, anywhere else you look in town will be nicer."
"We loved staying in our beautiful cabin - it was peaceful (the stars are so bright and you can hear birds and little lizards) and it had a comfortable bed, cushy towels, nice lighting... everything we needed.   The service was better than we expected (daily cleaning) and the staff were always available and super helpful and friendly - just down the driveway at Mamasan. Mamasan is a definitely worth visiting for food and drinks as well. On our first night we had the whole baked fish and arugula salad - it ri"
"We stayed at this hosts sister property called Casa Canciones. I cannot find it listed here on the site.  It was an amazing studio / 1 bedroom space with patio, hammocks and wonderful staff.  Absolutely incredible!"
" details:   - We had a rental car and there was parking for us and a few other guests along the driveway. It's a bit tight for space, but totally doable :)   - We rented bikes from in town (Ola Bikes) and biked around a lot! It can take a bit to get used to (lots of traffic/taxis/pedestrians/cyclists along the one, narrow road that goes along the beach) but it's a great way to get around to different restaurants, shops and the beach so you don't have to worry about parking.   - It takes about 35 minutes to "
"My 7-day holiday could not have been better. My friend and I refer to ourselves as adventurous individuals, therefore, we always need to distract ourselves in an activity. Casa Aquamarine offers not only peace, but also exceptional water activities right in front of the villa. With a beautiful view from the reef of the bay and crystal coral waters, this villa offers isolation from the city and divergence into nature's embrace. Regarding the villa itself, we enjoyed the spacious and clean rooms, and especial"

" hypnotizing sound of gentle waves.  Of course, if one wants to reconnect with the world, the WiFi works perfectly at all times. The housekeepers always greet you with a smile upon their faces and are very helpful, making you feel at home. The ambiance of the bay is quiet and tranquil. Casa Aquamarine definitely offers you paradise before your eyes. An amazing experience and definitely recommended."
Nos hemos quedado en Hacienda Caracol por 1 semana y ha sido increíble. La atención de Tino y Rolando en la cocina fue increíble.  Además la limpieza y el lugar siempre impecable para no tener que preocuparnos por nada. El lugar tuvo todo lo necesario para que un grupo de veinte personas pueda trabajar sin inconvenientes durante toda la estadía.  Gracias!
"I would definitely recommend the Stella Maris Hotel in Tulum. The staff was very friendly, the location was convient and the breakfast was good. It’s possible to rent bicycles from the hotel, so that’s easy for getting around town and for going to the beach."
Basic room large but no frills. White linen and towels.Inconsistant service. I had no water in my room the first day. Next day I did. Breakfast is luke warm coffee and terrible toast. The people beside me got fruit but I did not. Good wifi good shower ok pool but swim in cenotes or the beach. Lastly I was charged 500 pesos damage deposit. This has never happened in any other place Ive stayed at. All of Tulum is expensive by Mexican standards. Try Bacalar instead.
"Good: Location : It locations allows you to vist arquelogical zone in 10 min, restaurants and crafts walking 5 min , also if you like Cenotes to swim there are some near. Room: we take room #1 , it a large room with 2 queen size bed and also a compleate bathroom , hot/cold water any time.  Installations: there a small pool to refresh after a hot tour days,  You can observe that installations are in constant renewal. Price include a plain breakefast, scrammbble eggs  fruit and coffe, I you need more sustanci"
" in al lonely and dark street in order to take care your car. Tulum has the expensive rate per night that I have seen in Riviera maya , may be in low season the price would be better in quality-price relation. to come back to Stella, maybe not immediatly , but I can recomender it"

"It was very clean and great option if you do not want to stay at a hotel. Communication with the staff was difficult. It was far from any tourist attractions. I would prefer to stay where it is close to amenities and English speaking folks - only because I do not speak Spanish. If you speak Spanish, this would be a great place for you and your family!"
"We wanted a budget option without staying at a hostel. We also value quiet and managed to find both at Soles Mayas -- along with wifi and a pristine pool. There are even bicycles for use by guests. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. Do know that it is difficult to find and our GPS was not reliable. Parking was on the street, but we felt safe at all times. Staff is amazing although most do not speak English."
"El Stewart Hotel est très propre, complètement neuf. Les employés sont gentils et serviables. Le décor extérieur est joli et la piscine très appréciée. Cet hôtel se situe dans un nouveau développement, pas trop loin du centre-ville : les rues pour s'y rendre sont donc en terre battue.  Le prix des chambres devait inclure la TV et le WI-FI et les deux ne fonctionnaient pas... très dommage lorsqu'on paie pour ces services, c'est de la fausse représentation.

"Spent two nights here and we were very satisfied. Brand new with lots of amenities: mini fridge, hot water, cold ac, swimming pool. Clean, private cabanas. The owner is really friendly and helpful. Two minor complaints: it's tucked away on a side road which makes it somewhat hard to find, and no coffee! Eventually he plans on opening the restaurant but in the meantime bring your own instant coffee."
"Please be aware, this place is NOT central to anything. It’s a 90 minute walk to the beach, or a $25 USD cab…not kidding. You have to walk 45 minutes to any sort of super market.  There is an OXXO close by to buy beer and cigarettes, that’s about it.  Room are ok, but all dishes had to be rewashed before using as it was apparent that the last guests quickly rinsed in dirty water.  We also only had one working toilet and informed the host about this the next/first morning. He said he would fix it, which neve"

We stayed there for four nights in the room without the pool. Room was clean, spacious, well equipped. It has everything you need for quick vacations. The people working there are so nice, I wish every hotel had a same vibes.

"Estuvimos 3 noches en diciembre, y nos encantó! Valoramos mucho estar en plena naturaleza, alejados del ruido y el tráfico, pero a la vez a una distancia corta en coche del centro de Tulum. Es un alojamiento alternativo para amantes de la naturaleza y la tranquilidad. Sus instalaciones son excelentes y muy cómodas, todo hecho con mucho gusto y detalle. El desayuno muy rico y sano, nos gustó mucho! Los propietarios son personas realmente encantadoras, nos trataron con mucho cariño y se preocuparon por que no"
"La mejor opción para mantenerse cerca del núcleo de la Rivera Maya pero alejado a la vez de ruido, trafico y masificación.  Rodeado de naturaleza, es una maravilla la paz que se respira por las noches, y ese desayuno entre arboles y pájaros recibiendo el día.  El trato de los propietarios es exquisito, en educación y afecto, y su interés por hacerte sentir cómodo es sensacional. Repetiría."

Abbiamo fatto fatica a trovarlo quando siamo arrivati a tulum ma Marco, il titolare, ci ha pazientemente spiegato come arrivare. Lui, insieme a sua moglie Carmen ci hanno fatto sentire a casa. Sono stati molto disponibili e gentili. Sono due persone davvero dolci. La location é effettivamente suggestiva ma è un pochino fuori mano per cui è necessario essere auto muniti per muoversi liberamente. Ottima la colazione ser"
This motel isn’t anything extraordinary but it’s always clean and comfy to stay. I love their AC which is quiet and powerful (Some of the other motels I stayed in Tulum have really loud AC and they take forever to get cool and I hate it). I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a quiet and powerful AC! 
The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The room is very simple. We had some food with us and would of liked to have a small fridge in the room (as described in our reservation) but there wasn't any. There is not a lot of parking space and it's not easy to park. In general it's a clean and comfortable hotel.
THIS HOSTEL IS A DISGRACE. It's changed hands since going online apparently and has fallen into complete disrepair. The pool is a swamp. The air con doesn't exist. The room is a sauna. And filthy. The staff are rude. The breakfast doesn't exist. The wifi doesn't work. The owner is a crack head. DO NOT STAY HERE.

The tv only has Spanish channels . I think it was overpriced . Better value and better location hotels available . The staff were ok , not bad . But to be honest this hotel is a little sterile . "
Very good place to stay.  The rooms are very clean . Everyone was super nice.  It is located at the south end of the main towns Main Street so everything you need is within walking distance but you don't have the noise or hustle of being right down town. You can rent bikes or scooters and cars for getting around. The main beach isn't that close but easy to get to. Parking a car is easy up town but can be difficult down at the beach.  Thank you 
"Akadia has a chilled vibe and plenty of facilities. The hostel has lots of open space, hammocks to chill in and a kitchen. There's also space for people who want to camp too. The beds in the dorms are completely enclosed in material except for a small hole with a curtain to get in so you have more darkness and privacy than in most hostels. While I was there they were in the process of making improvements to the hostel which should be great once complete. The girl at reception in the mornings was especially "
"Huge condo, but...  Here are the pros and cons  PROS:    very big rooms internet is decent quiet nice court yard  CONS:    Light bulbs burnt in the kitchen, asked to replace and told they would be - but weren't changed.  When we cook at about 7pm, it's dark outside and it is also dark in the kitchen.  I understand that ants are part of warm countries, but having them coming out on the counter kitchen is not appetizing when you are cooking  For a luxury condo, we were expecting to have salt & pepper in the k"
Very clean lovely staff and wifi did work in my room perfect.  Negatives shower light flow either scolding hot or cold.   Hotel quite noisy near main roads.  Dog barking opposite very early morning and night.   A generator opposite gave ambient noise all night if you turned AC off which also quite loud.   Miles from beach and a good few blocks on fairly dark street to main hub.   It is value for money as cheap very clean and man on front desk adorable.   About 5 miles or more from beach not walkable.
"Thought the room was spacious, the bathroom too. I can't remember if we had a shower problem, if we did, it probably wasn't bad enough to be remembered. The WiFi signal was weak, our room was close to the reception so it wasn't terrible. It didn't bother us too much as we were too busy exploring Tulum. There is no restaurant at the hotel, there is however a small coffee and tea bar that you can swing by. We had a rental car, and for some reason we had to park in front of the hotel (really close to Tulum Ave"
Everything about this hostel is great! I went straight back there during my second visit to Tulum! The staff are great! The layout is really funky and the artwork is breathtaking to say the least... and it has a huuuge garden/patio area.. The location is perfect! Right in the heart of the town. And it's a really good price for Tulum... I now have so many lovely memories of this quirky original hostal! If you're a music lover i recommend it 100% they're all incredible musicians... viva akadianos!
" again, for a luxury condo, we would expect that we would have scissors, knives, can openers, garbage cans without rust on them.  Also, a TV in each room would be nice :-) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Maybe we had too big expectations since we thought we were going to be in a 'luxury' condo and it was just 'ok'.  Small little things as mentioned above would have help to have a better experience."
" tugged behind the main street that was super cheap but super tasty, something like 5 pesos each, the Mexican guy that was making the tacos had blue, blue eyes (which is unusual in this part of Mexico).  We also found a white 'tent' right on Tulum Avenue where an Arts and Crafts festival was going on, it was set to end on Dec 20th or 21st of 2015, there, we got lots unique souvenirs for a good price. They had things coming from all corners of Mexico, it was somewhere in between the ruins and our hotel right"
"I have never given a 1/5 review before, so consider myself to be a fair, level-headed reviewer - but this place took the biscuit.   First I arrived and it didn't even seem like a hostel, just an open courtyard and a horrible looking place. Also there seemed to be a 6 year old manning the reception area. On approach the child ran off and a guy appeared from around the corner so I gave him my details - he then disappeared. A second guy arrived (I assume they both work there, but who knows) to tell me that the"

A few minutes later a 3rd chap arrived and led me to the upstairs dorm (which is horrid btw) and showed me 2 free mattresses. He disappeared and left me to carry a bloody mattress downstairs, a felt like a right idiot. So eventually I put my mattress on the bed and had a look around the room....then one of the other backpackers in my room confirmed what I suspected - this was a female only dorm (Im not f"

"The rooms themselves are nice, but the hotel is located a bit of a walk from most of the shops and restaurants in Tulum and quite far from the beach. It would be fine to get around if you rented a bike though. The shower was terrible though - only a trickle of water and cold, my friend and I were rinsing our hair in the sink. Also, you need to walk outside to get wifi and it's kind of spotty - I had to move around a lot to keep a signal. The staff were friendly and helpful though, and there was ample parkin"

"Akadia Hostel is a really nice place with a great vibe. The staff are friendly and always willing to help you, they make you feel like home. Beds are confortable,  rooms and bathrooms are clean. One of the best things is that they have a big backyard with and amazing swimming pool, hammocks zone to chill out and relax and cool paintings on the walls. Mexican food for breakfast is delicious. I hardly recommend to stay in Akadia if you come to Tulum."
"Was on business and stayed for 5 days. Had all I wanted with ac, fridge and wi-fi working well and large comfortable rooms. Sorry I did not use the inviting pool but too busy. 2 minutes out of town so very quiet. Will stay again "
"The Management here were very accommodating and helpful. The location was a little out of town but within walking distance and it had all amenities e.g AC, towels, swimming pool. The apartments were nice, modern and large.  There are 2 dogs that live with the owners that are VERY friendly, not ideal if allergic though as they are around 24/7."
"My friend and I stayed here for 2 nights. We liked the location, it was clean and spacious, the front desk was nice and there was free parking (we rented a car for 2 days). Three things we did not like: 1) the shower was probably the worst we had (just a trickle the first night and barely more on the second) 2) we put the do not disturb sign out during our day out as we didn't want our room cleaned for the one full day we were there and they went in an cleaned it anyway 3) wifi didn't reach the room (had to"
"I stated in the cabanas, falling asleep with the sound of the ocean has no price. I have no complains, I had everything I needed, there is a shower, bathrooms and they provide clean water at no extra cost. It is close to restaurants and next to the beach. If you want to experience nature at is best, go here."
"I'm a pretty easy-going traveler, and if the place is clean, I'm usually happy. Booked a room online for 3 nights. It took 3 phone calls, one email and one Facebook message for them to confirm the reservation. Then we got there and it literally smelled like poop. There was some kind of problem with a drain. It was bad. They also advertise their swimming pool but the water was green and filthy. The room wasn't ready and it took about two extra hours before we could leave our stuff. Then they couldn't find th"
This is without a doubt one of my favorite places in the Tulum area. Everytime i come To Tulum i always stay at the Blueberry Condos. Me and my girl friend live in New York City and go there twice a year. We love it.   Look its not at the beach or in the center of town but thats a good thing because the center of town can be loud with traffic and construction. Staying by the beach can be extremely expensive and the wifi will suck and the AC can only be used certain hours a day. Yes its secluded but if you d
"Maya Luum is what it is.....We did not stay here but used their beach many times. Great beach, secluded if you want to go nude. The cost is only 50 pesos with some bar service available. Very few people around but a great staff to move chairs etc. if you like. I will spend more time there next year because they are super friendly....."
"To the left of this hotel: $300/night rooms. To the right: $300/night rooms. Camping Maya Luum: $10/night. This was such an incredible find, I've spent the majority of my vacation here. I did take a 1 day break to sleep in a real bed and use a good shower, but then I headed right back.  You will literally sleep in a tent with a view of the beach. The Sea breeze will be more than sufficient air conditioning (I wore light long sleeves/pants to sleep, and the temperature can be moderated by adjusting the openi"
" gross. When I turned the water on, dirty water overflowed from the drain everywhere - in the shower, on my feet and on my stuff. After that we just left. It took about 45 minutes to do the check-out because no one was really helping us at the desk... just run away from that place! GROSS!"
"Staff is friendly helpful and give good service. Good price for quality. Food 4 stars. Could use another pool with no activities so you cab have a relaxing swim and place to lay and enjoy.  Its a hassel to get cabanas, bu theres plenty of comfortable lounges."
" of town can be noisy, have traffic or construction near them. So the Blueberry is great because its hidden and very quiet. And you are only 5min taxi cab to the beach. 25min by bike. its so quiet sometimes during the day you can sit by the pool and get lost in your own thoughts. The pool is cleaned daily and has an area for diving - so if you have a waterproof camera it makes the fun endless. The condo is gorgeous and very spacious. The kitchen is very nice and well equipped - as i love to cook. Bathrooms,"
This place exceeded my expectations. 3 families consisting of 6 adults and 14 “kids” ranging in age 12-21. Food was so good.  Service was excellent. Kudos to Ms Irene(chef) Jose Kim Limberg and the cleaning crew daily. Best place ever. 
" water is a great temperature and there are basically zero rocks. The beach is essentially private, shielded by rock outcroppings and only accessible via 3-5 resorts. The majority of the beach belongs to Maya Luum but if they're feeling charitable, they let the visitors from the neighboring resorts wander onto their part of the beach (I'll repeat this: the $10 place has a beach x10 nicer than the $300 ones).  Accommodations are sparse. Bring a flashlight and all your own toiletries, towels, etc. They have S"

Got a fantastic price for this all inclusive resort so we decided to go for a week's visit.  Check-in was immediate and extremely simple.  We had a cocktail in our hand 30 minutes after arrival.  Room had a slight musty scent from humidity but there was an incense burner in the room which took care of that in short time.  Plugs in wall had two USB ports for charging as well as numerous plugs throughout room.  We had a junior suite so we had a private swimming moat directly out our back patio door.  King siz
"Family with 14 adults (ages 19 - >60) and 5 children ages 2 - 13 stayed here in July.  We opted for the chef.  The main house was great and we realized that we used the living room maybe 3 times during the week.  This was due to the awesome outdoor area.  There are large outdoor couches around the pool, chairs on the beach with good tree shade, hammocks on the beach, and our favorite place:  the large palapa with a large table and plenty of chairs.  Most of us spent the majority of the time in the palapa, a"

If you truly want to have an off-the-grid amazing relaxed vacation, this is the real deal.  You may either visit here for the day ($5USD) or you may bring your own tent or stay in a cabana.  We have come to this place many times because of its relaxed back-to-nature vibe.  There is limited electricity and water, but you are "

Not a huge night partier so listened to live music but did not attend late night events so cannot comment.  Few mentions.

Mateo's is a short walk for excellent food and there is always live music in the evenings along the Bocapaila strip.  If you must have a blowdryer, this is not the place for you.  But if you wish to relax with Corona, listen to the waves and get back to mother earth, you must visit."

"We had four families for a total of 19 guests (8 adults; and 11 children ranging from 4-16 years old).  There was more than enough space for us all, and we even had a couple of rooms unoccupied.  The set up is 4 bedrooms in the main house; one bedroom attached to the main house but only accessed through outside; and four garden casitas.  This served our needs very well but depending on the make-up of your group it might not be suitable for all.  If you have a lot of very young children to have their own roo"
"The wait staff was amazing and so was the burgers and drinks. However I give it zero stars for the treatment we got when leaving this establishment, not from the wait staff but from their security. When walking in a security guy walked up to us and said there was no public beach access. My husband and I told him we were there for lunch and drinks. Fast forward a few hours later as we are leaving the same guy blocks my way asking if he can help me. He proceeds to rudely say ""There's no free beach access."" We"
 responded by yelling out to his colleagues to call the police. The manager came to see what was happening and my husband demanded we get an apology from his Colleague that had singled us out. This experience was upsetting because not only did we eat and drink there but we also paid for parking and even rented beach towels at the same establishment. But more so at the fact that he stopped us and no one else which made us feel targeted. This was our second time in TULUM and it has was the first time we had a

The chef made an amazing job and was very skillful in preparing different options to meet our needs, since some of us had a few eating restrictions.

"The place and the beach are really nice, but de music es very very loud! From 11 am to 10 pm the place is done for partys, not for chilling.  you cant talk with your friends or enjoy the sound of the sea !"
Great condo with excellent owners we spent the winter there last winter and had the time of our life. The pool is awesome and they have the greatest bartender down at the poolside bar. We have been there several times and will be back very soon! Shannon and Jim the owners are great people and will take care of you!

Beautiful place -quite new with friendly staff and great concept.  Lovely grounds and plenty to do near by.  You do need a car to make the most of the location.  Rough road but worth it!  Will return! Great trip.
If it was not for this hotel I would have hate my last 2 days of vacation in Mexico. I would not recommend Tulum but I strongly recommend this place. It is an oasis in the jungle and the place for breakfast has a wonderful view on the cenote towards the raising sun. The road to go there is a bit rough but the hotel deserves the effort. The cabins have the roof made with leaves but with our big surprise are resistant to big storms!!! Wonderful!!

There is room for a few car inside the wall as well. The property is about 7 minutes outside of the main tourist area along the highway, and as a smaller woman, I"

Loved the hammock on the patio and taking a dip in the pool. The only drawback to this spot is that it's quite a distance from the beach. But if you have a car or can afford taxis, it's not a big deal and worth it to have somewhere calm, safe and affordable to lay your head at the end of the day. Really enjoyed my stay!"

BE WARNED this place is not as advertised! They advertise themselves as a hotel but it is really a hostel. The building has no front door or a receptionist/security so pretty much anyone can walk in at any time. The shared kitchen was in a disgusting state for the duration of our stay with an extremely foul smell coming from the fridge. The sheets for the bed had nasty stains on them -- I've attached 3 photos for 3 separate sets of sheets. On top of that our room was right next to the generator which would

We even agreed to pay a penalty since technically the place has a no cancellation policy though I'd argue that given all the issues we faced we shouldn't have had to pay anything extra.

 air within your rooms. The charming quarters each face into a jungled courtyard. I found it to be both private and easily social at the same time. It is located in an ideal spot. It is a 5 minute walk from the bus terminal and  Avenida Tulum- the main street in town. There is an excellent taqueria nearby: Sabor del Mar-get your fish tacos here! There were so many great places to eat nearby! The Rincon ? (red taqueria at the corner) the Carbonchito- evening joint with tables on a patio and hombres shuffling
Staff were not friendly at all (specially the young guy). The hostel was really noisy during the night (after 11 pm) and staff did not do anything to solve this issue. Humidity inside of the room (I was in a double one) was extremely high leading to a disgusting smell and an uncomfortable sensation. The toilet in these rooms is not close with an obvious lack of privacy (your roommate will hear and smell everything from you...).

When checkin they asked that we could pay the first night in cash, ATM is not that far but when retrieving money from the ATM there will be 12% charged. The prive for the first night was 550 dollar for the cabanas with ocean view so we stayed here 1 night and the next nights where in a room behind this one. They charged 410 dollar a night. After one night there where parties every day until 10:30pm we didn’t know nothing "

"If you are traveling to Tulum, it is a must go to Arianes place. She offers a beautiful garden with 4 very different accommodations, every one is unique. She is a real survivalist and very artistic and everything that she creates she does it with lots of love and creativity! You definitely will feel inspired and free in her environment!!  This time we could live in her new creation: The Casa Tapanco. It is a beautiful house with very high ceiling, a lot of space and a superb loft bed with a mosquito net wit"
"I didn't love this place, but it was nice.  The social area is small and not very comfortable.  There's no where to go if you're a shy person, so you're basically forced to leave or lay in bed.  Kinda has a hippy stoner yoga vibe."
" the lights of.   Breakfast and food isn’t worth the money, you better can have breakfast and lunch in other places.  Be sure to reserve you beach bed not once but twice because they have given in away two times to guest from outside the hotel, very strange when you pay this amount of money for a two star hotel.   There’s no isolation so you can hear neighbours talk until early in de morning, maybe that’s why the rooms have a speaker with ocean sound or jungle sound. The bathroom is ok but the water smells "
" talks spanish, english and german it might be also a relief for once, depending what language you prefer. You definitely will feel at home at her place, if we could we would visit her every year!!  We highly recommend her place and as Tulum is growing and growing there you still find a real oasis with heart and soul. To us Ariane became a very good friend and we are more than thankful that we met her."
"I arrived late in the evening and they gave my double bedroom to someone else as they claimed Booking.com had issues that day (I believe them as I had a few issues already with the website in my 2 months journey so far...), so they set me up in a dorm alone with my own bathroom. It was a little disappointing to have a bunk bed instead of a double, especially after 12 hours on a bus; but the bed was excellent, best mattress in months! the room was cleaned daily and the staff was incredibly helpful.

"Aerolito is a walled compound very near to downtown Tulum.  It has a jungle vibe with wonderful vegetation.  There are three suites, with another under construction, and Ariane (the owner)'s quarters.  She serves a wonderful large breakfast each morning.  The property is rustic and charming.  I would recommend it to young people on a budget, adventurers, eco-naturists, and explorers.  Some nights there might be noise, but that is because you are in a town.  There are wonderful, inexpensive restaurants in to"

"We booked the hotel for a special occasion with my friends.  1) They sent an email a few days before arrival informing us that they don't accept credit cards, which is absurd because they are not cheap 2) they informed us that we could pay through paypal when we asked for other options, BUT we were charged the processing fee (hotel never mentioned this) 3) They were remodeling the hotel during our stay and were painting walls, doors, furniture just hours before check-in.

"I stayed there for only two nights and overall enjoyed all the experience there. This is a new place in Tulum. The hostel is run by a mother and a son. Dorms are reasonably priced. Good, simple breakfast. Free wifi. Clean place."
" AND they charges us the fee again 5) They have very bad water pressure and water is not sweet water  WORST PART: And now I am getting messages from the staff threatening me because of sharing my review and opinion of my experience with them and in their hotel.....   I would avoid this place, there are way better places to stay in Tulum. The only thing this place has going for it, is that it is straight on the beach."

"We stayed in aerolito for 4 nights in the ""Casa Alux"".  Aerolito is just a short walk (maybe 6 mins) from the main street with many great restaurants and the ADO station, which was important to us. Despite some of the other reviews, we found Ariane to be absolutely lovely and helpful. She was always chatting with us and trying to help us out. She even suggested us a tour with her friend, which was customised to our interests. It was expensive but worth it for the experience. We had a cooked breakfast every "

We booked like three months ago for a Bachelorette Party, and the girls that arrived one day before stay there for on night, the next morning they went out for a trip very early, when day came back they had a big surprise:  they decided to paint all the hotel and dismount doors, windows and furniture without even consider the smell and discomfort for the guests.

"Great place for families!! Fantastic staff, we absolutely fell in love with them. Community kitchen was a plus, especially when you get to share it with fantastic people from all around the world. The cenote was great, we swam, kayaked, and went snorkeling there."
"The nine or so kilometers of the Tulum strip is wonderfully devoid of corporate hotels and restaurants, but offers a very considerable range of options from basic and grungy (Camp Chavez) to elite and perfectionist (Encantada). My partner and I were not going to consider anything over $100 a night, let alone the $400+ options, and wouldn't have wanted an insular or elite setting anyhow. We spent one pleasant night at Kiras, which was very friendly but a bit pricey and not totally exciting. We then moved ont"
"I very much enjoyed my stay at Calm Cabins. Dora was a gracious host. The accommodation was clean and basic--exactly what one should expect for the price. The negative reviews are silly and seem to come from inexperienced travelers that think they're going to find luxury accommodations at bargain basement prices.  As you can see from the map, the location is just a block or so off the main drag, so convenient if you're using public transportation. I've rented a car both times I visited Tulum and was glad I "
" easy nonetheless). The shared spaces are simple and rustic, but nice, and usually full of life. The limited electricity and wifi (evenings only) was ideal for us, as we wanted some access but a good excuse to ignore our phones throughout the day. It reinforced the beautiful simplicity of the place. The cenote in the back was clean and refreshing, fun both for swimming and for kayaking (kayaks are included). Leo was an extremely friendly and thoughtful host, and we enjoyed sitting with the whole crew for a "
"Me and my Italian friend Gavina stayed in the Cabins in town. It was few years back, and this lovely couple, Dora and Pierre did their best to accommodate us on the best level. The place is calm, full of plants and has such a great ambient.

"Incredible! Italian family superb! We've been like at home, they were waiting for us because we've arrived around 21:30 h, they offered us beberage for wellcome (some drinks) but we were so tired, on the day after, they prepared for us a splendid breakfast with fresh fruit, toast italian coffee, juices, even some eggs if we desired.

"We contacted the couple that owns this place to find a room, based on the reviews. When we spoke to them, we were told that the hostel was full, but they have a second location just out of town. These shacks are located 1km away from town in a noisy neighborhood. There is no AC, two outlets in the entire hut (one of which must be used for the fan if you don't want to sweat all night), the bed was filthy, the windows don't lock and are falling off the hinges. All night we heard gunshots and people screaming "
"I have been to many different budget places in Tulum, but this one was by far the most special and most friendly! It’s magical!  The few cabanas are very cute and clean. The whole place is very well taken care of. You are staying next to your own personal cenote to take your morning swim in ! Then, if you want, you get the most amazing breakfast omelette made by the super friendly crew. You meet all kinds of nice people while cooking together at the community kitchen …. You are 2 minutes from the beach … I "
"We just visited this cabanas and with all my heart it's the best most relaxing and friendly place on earth.   It is the place for those who truly wants to run away from all the worries, work, internet, and just be with the nature. Andrea, Leo, and Diego are so friendly and helpful. They make you feel like you all are one family.  Yes, the cabañas are simple but has all you need to feel real jungle lifestyle. Most important just I front the cabanas is the most beautiful bit of all the beach in Tulum. Very li"
"Casa Rosina is a new, pristine casa. Italian owners were very friendly and hosbitable. They offered us a ride to the city and delicious pastries. Room was very clean (note there is only fan) and wifi worked well. Breakfast was good (granola ++++).   Con about Casa Rosina is it's location - it is in the middle of nowhere. There is no proper roads to Casa Rosina yet. You have to either use  taxi and tell the driver where to drive, or cycle in daylight (Casa rosina has free good cycles to use). This was a majo"
 this one is nothing but trouble.
"At the end of the zona hotelera, Xbalamque offers low budget cosy cabanas with a nice bed and mosquitos net. Shared kitchen (without mosquitos net) where you can assist to robberies from raccoones. I love those animals! Wifi and electricity from 5pm to 2am only. Shared bathrooms and showers. 50m from the beach-probably one of the best in the area. Nice cenote in the back. "
…
"We are Tulum junkies and had spent a little time at Xbalamque a couple of years ago when staying across the road. So this year when it came time to book, we decidied on Xbalamque knowing it would be near our favorite stretch of beach and would be more economical during the high tourist season for the week we intended to be there.  This is not the kind of place for the picky traveler who wants the comforts of home... it's not quite camping style, but close. It's well maintained and very clean most of the tim"

We had a lot of rain during our stay. The cenote was greener and murkier than a few years ago, but that could be due to the unusual amount of rain they've been getting. It was still refreshing after our swims in the ocean just across the street through a brief passage.   I might avoid the cabana on the south end (side where kitch"

She has 2 places, one that she lives at with cabins and then another a few blocks away where we stayed! We were the only ones staying there in a nice cabin out back with a beautiful garden and little kitchen, there is also a pool but when we stayed it was off season so it was empty!

"My friend and I paid higher rates to stay here during the high season. This place is not worth the money they are asking for it.  We never actually met ""Dora"".  We met Irma.  The place looked nothing like the photos.  It's not even a cabin.  There were lizards and bugs all in the room.  There is no air conditioning and the place is advertised as having plenty of fans.  It had 1 ceiling fan that did not keep the room cool.  It was so miserable in there, we couldn't sleep.  The only thing decent about this st"

First of all, the locals were EXCEPTIONALLY nice and friendly. Helps to speak some Spanish but our drivers were able to get us where we needed.    Now on la calma... wow.

"Calm Cabins is just off the main drag, close to the bus station, and fairly basic.  We spent 6 nights there. Our room was clean and comfortable, spacious and well-fitted. The owner-host, Dora, serves breakfast in the open area in the compound; wholesome, filling and different every day.  Dora is a gem: she knows the area well and will give any help you request.  Go chill there."
" Just a simple camping fan would have been a major plus. We spoke with David about this.  Being completely off-grid, the technology is just not there for energy efficient fans... yet.  He discussed this in detail about bringing in Tesla batteries but that is in the future.  Great place, great food, great times. "
"To be sincere I didn't like the experience: I think it was dirty the tent, the toilet and overall over the place. The place needs to renovate and freshen up. It's expensive and the towels is not included in the price. It's called ""glamping"", in others words ""glamorous camping"" and I didn't feel that at all....  To charge your phone from your tent is available from 07 pm to 12 pm. Also the wi-fi is available at that time.  I could also hear the personal arguing with each other several times which also made i"

"La Calma is a sweet and quiet jungle retreat. In the commune area off the Dos Ojos access road, the location is convenient to Sian Kaan Biosphere, Tulum, Akumal, and surrounding areas. The accommodations are simple and clean. The food is all scratch-made and nutritious... and can be catered to fit the needs a given crowd. The staff of four is all Czech, and I personally liked all of them. Please note this retreat is totally off the grid in terms of entertainment (and that is a good thing)... no WiFi, land l"
"We spent a night here with our campervan & had a great time! Galia was a super host, a very warm and welcoming person and we had great chats with her over breakfast. The kitchen is well stocked and the bathrooms clean - we particularly loved the showers. You can rent kayaks and go out on the cenote which is cool. If you get too hot they will also rent you a fan for the night time. If you like a laid back vibe in the middle of nature - this is for you. It’s somewhere very different to stay in tulum and a coo"

There are a few hammocks and seats for relaxing there, as well as the main dining table and serving table. The yoga palapa is fabulous... in the jungle. The Dos Ojos cenote is an easy walk away, and the larger ""second eye"" is huge and a joy to explore with a mask and snorkel."
"Whenever I go to Tulum, this is the only place I stay. It is simply magical. I love the people and the vibe. The cenote in the back is literally the ultimate swimming hole, crystal clear and refreshing. No matter how rough the ocean is, or how much seaweed there is, I always have a perfect place to swim. The campground is located past all of the development and noise, and is a true enclave of peace. At night, all I hear is the sound of the wind in the palms, and the distant roar of the ocean. The stars blaz"

Food was Delicious, made fresh everyday, and healthy.  Drivers were friendly and so accommodating ! Staff at La Calma were by far, some of the best I have ever dealt with. If you love animals, you will fall in love with them here!  A solar powered fan, on those occasional, VERY hot nights would have been nice, was t"

We stayed at another location and visited the Cenote. We got there very early in the morning. Martin let us in and provided life vests. The water was refreshing and the price reasonable. It would have been nice if there was a stable dock with steps as it was difficult for one of our older friend to safely get into the water.
"We came here on our  Tulum adventure and I just can't say enough . This place is close but hidden , you can walk 15 minutes to an amazing cenote , the rooms are gorgeous and big , we had our meals cooked for us and they were so good , all fresh , local , tasty . We had yoga in the palapa looking the jungle and hearing the birds, catching glimpses of other animals , we had massages. It was good after a day of adventure to come here and just relax .No wifi or cell service which I see it as good, time to talk "
"Galia, the owner, is a really gentle and nice person, interesting and outgoingly hospitable. Her manager, Martin, was also nice and helpful.  Galia gave us a tour and was very available for anything we needed.

"We absolutely loved our time at La Calma over New Years 2015/2016. The rooms were very cute, the setting beautiful, and the team couldn't have been better. David's recommendations of what to see and do each day were spot on - we discovered some exceptionally beautiful spots from his advice. Lucy and Svatka were really lovely too - so warm and welcoming and the food they whipped up each morning and evening was delicious, fresh, and healthy with a Mexican flair. I highly recommend booking La Calma! Go for the"
" swimming.  The cost seemed a little high for what it is, but I think the management is sincere, cares for guests and the environment, and has something special to offer.  We went in the hot season (early July) and part of my family was too hot to sleep in the still, hot air of the tent, also frustrated because the environment there naturally hosts lots of mosquitoes, which bit our kid a lot.  I would recommend this special place heartily as long as one knows to expect mosquitoes and is prepared to sleep in"
"La Calma is a great eco-lodge if you're looking for something quaint and simple, but most importantly, if you want to disconnect from the digital world in order to connect with the natural one. This was what I was looking to do in Mexico for two weeks, so this was exactly what I needed. La Calma is typically used for yoga retreats, so the energy is positive and relaxing where you can really spend time reflecting, re-energizing and refocusing your thoughts.. You wake up to a healthy organic breakfast made by"

"We visited the cenote only of this place and after visiting several ones in Tulum this one was the most deceiving. It was refreshing to swim in, but it really looks like a small lake. There is some decks all around with people drinking and camping which is fine if it's your thing but it was definitely not the nature experience I was expecting, more a place where people go to party."
"Recently we (two couples) spent a wonderful 10 days at Rancho San Eric, Casa Colibri-not Casa Blanca.  Casa Colibri is a lovely two bedroom/two bath casita just steps from the Caribbean and is just one of the several individual accommodations that comprise Rancho San Eric.  We loved the location which is on the south end of the busy hotel and beach strip about 10kms. from Tulum Pueblo.  Rancho San Eric remains  a quite, tranquil oasis secluded from the chaos, the hyper development and non stop party scene t"

The management of RSE offers a food shopping/provisioning service for a small fee so that when you arrive your fridge will be stocked with whatever items you desire.  Communication with the the owners is easy and fast.  The staff on site is there to provide you with friendly and helpful service.  For those who want a taste of beautiful Tulum as it used to be, I can only give RSE my highest recommendation.  I hope that we will be able to ma"
"Had such a good experience at this hostel — the staff was lovely. The ambiance was peaceful and gave you the feeling of being secluded in the jungle of tulum while still being close to everything —Town is a short 10 minute walk.  Rooms are clean! Nice kitchen and beautiful garden common area with pool , tables and hammocks. "

"Wow wow wow! From owner to staff to location to home, everything was absolutely perfect! Close to all, located on the beach, across the street from cenotes, Mayan Laguna, restaurants and more. Was able to jog, kiteboard, walks on the beach, lay by pool and/or beach. Highly recommended. Absolutely coming back. Thank you to the entire rancho san Eric family!"
"I was amazed by the beautiful and unique common area in this hostel. The photos looked nice, but while standing on the other side of the gate awaiting staff to open for check-in, I did not expect it to be this cool and unique. I don't often stay in a private either, as I love dorm-style, but this was the perfect experience to do so. Excellently crafted rooms, with a great balance of rustic & modern.  Javier was phenomenal! Such great hospitality and very accommodating to all of our requests. Loved his frien"
"Without a doubt, one of our most favorite places to stay in the world, if not THE most. We plan on being back many more times. And we hope to be honored to stay at Rancho San Eric every time. You will not believe how gorgeous their property is, each place positioned to make the most of the beach. We slept nightly with the waves crashing just at the bottom of the steps to our own area of the sand.   These are quite minimalist offerings if you are used to Villas or resorts. But what they lack in accommodation"
My cousin and I had a good time here. The staff is amazing and they go out there way to make sure you are okay. The dorms were kept clean. It’s a bit far from downtown but if you have a car or don’t mind taking the local shuttle this is a great place with the right price.
We enjoyed staying at this lovely property right next to the sea.  Very quiet setting.  They have a nice palapa with hammocks to relax in.  We stayed in the Tikal room which directly faced the ocean with beautiful views right from the bed.  Breakfast included which made a great way to start the day.  There is a cenote just a few minutes walk down the road as well as two restaurants so we often found ourselves there dining on the sand at the end of the day since it was just a stroll to get there.  Close to t
Beautiful the external part and the garden where you can meet the other guests or just chill out. Staff really nice but no proposal of activity in there. Really open minded you can cook or prepare your cocktails in every moment. Bikes for rental is a good deal. Only complain one bathroom for all the dorms. Great position to discover Tulum. Alice & Damona
"Me and my partner stayed here for 4 nights. Was great, cheap accom for Tulum just off the main road. Staff were very friendly and the outside area is awesome to chill in hammocks with a beer and free breakfast and bike borrow was such a good bonus! Only downside was that the rooms were very noisy."
" comfortable beds. The furniture was not very comfortable inside, but you can imagine why.  The patio area was gorgeous outside.   You will not find much more than that though. We were used to private villas that offered at least some condiments, salt/pepper, sugar, etc upon arrival. So the result is that for that sort of stuff, we ended up having to buy things we will use for three to six days and then throw away? Seemed odd. And the property doesn't have bike rentals, or run their own tours, or have room "
"The Hostel is the best, really comfy, and clean, the showers are amazing and Gabriela in the front desk is an absolute angel.  Thank you for everything i hope i can come back soon   Really recommended...."
Modern and clean! Everything is brand new. We stayed 2 nights. Beautiful pool and very comfortable beds! Fast Internet provided. The owner (Sandro) will help you with everything you need! It's best if you have a car to go out for lunch or dinner. Free parking in front of hotel. Continental breakfast included was good. We recommend!
"We stayed at the Tankah Inn for 10 nights, 2/26 - 3/8/18.  We stayed in the Tikal room, and were pleasantly surprised at the incredible view. The windows face east, and you get to wake up to an incredibly beautiful sunrise over the caribbean, which is totally visible right from your bed. None of the other rooms have a view this spectacular. The first 6-7 nights of our stay, we had the beach virtually to ourselves.  The solitude was wonderful. We felt so safe and alone, that we slept with our windows open ev"

"We stayed in Casa Calibri which is a rustic two bedroom apartment. There is great access to the beach, it is just beyond from the main hotel strip and therefore nice and quiet and the staff are wonderful. The only reasons for not giving the full five starts was that, whist not wanting it to have the facade of a McDonalds till, the outdoors area could have done with some more lighting for evenings. Secondly, both us and our neighbours agreed that the caged birds are a bit ‘80’s and is quite distressing to se"
" the room was clean and adequate, and the view was as good as it gets. It is a 5 minute walk to a fabulous cenote. They charge 120 pesos per person ($6). Get there early to snorkel and beat the crowds.  There is a sandy beach, but access to the water is very difficult due to the rocks.  Kids would not be able to play in the water here. It is a good long walk either north or south to get away from the rocks. There is some decent snorkeling, but you have to go way out to get to the reef.  I did it once, but i"
"Stayed at this hostel for 2 nights in Tulum. It was beautiful and so relaxing. Carlos was really helpful as was Vicky who came to make breakfast! The outdoor area with pool and hammocks was amazing, pictures honestly can’t do it justice.

"Stayed at Casa Dunia last month with a group of friends. The villa is gorgeous, comfortable, well maintained, very clean and in a beautifully tranquil setting with a private beach. Nothing was too much for the owner and staff, who were incredibly helpful. We had breakfast cooked every day and two dinners over the week, and the food was superb. A great stay - highly recommended."
"My first time in Tulum was in 1992, when I used to live in Mexico City.  Of course Tulum was MUCH different from now, it was an untouched pristine gorgeous beach with very few basic places to stay. I went back a few times in the 90s, until I moved to New York. After a hiatus of about 12 years, I went back to Tulum with my partner in 2009. It had already started to change, many new hotels and tourism infrastructure had developed since, but remained a wonderful place. We have been back every year from 2009 an"

Willy and Victor did a great job setting us up with tours and restaurants in town. Don't worry if you still have questions from one of the tours you went on catch Willy at breakfast the next morning and he can fill in the details.   The beach here is spectacular, I imagine it is what having a private beach feels like. There isn't much traffic, but if you want to live a little ther"
"The staff is so nice and helpful, they were super kind with us. The outdoors and shared areas are cozy and comfortable. The breakfast is excellent. It is a bit far from everything, so it is not the best location to arrive late at night."
"The place is simply a little gem in the overcrowded village. The staff is helpful, breakfast is decent and the rooms are spacious, clean, bright. It is completely worth the price. Moreover, the bikes are in good state I would definitely return."
"We stayed in a private property nearby but had breakfast here twice. It's a small kitchen- a one man operation mostly, but has a nice outdoor seating with a view of the bay or indoor if you prefer. This place is a good value and the breakfasts were great, except for the fruit salad which was a little disappointing. In their defense, it seemed a slower time and there were never more than three tables being served at once when we were eating. Hard to plan for such a small group. They have books to borrow left"
"We were unable to book a room anywhere on Tulum beach and were pleasantly surprised by our time at the Tankah Inn.  It is small and cozy with minimalist rooms and a nice beach.  We headed the advice of other reviewers and brought water shoes to go swimming at the beach out front.  The hotel let us borrow fins we used to go snorkeling further down the beach.  Breakfast was delicious and filling every morning.  The road and beach is fairly quiet, with just a few bars and restaurants.  We made friends with ano"

"A friend and I stayed for a week and felt sad to leave by the end! The staff were lovely, there were daily outings and it was a relaxed environment, not rowdy at all. Good facilities and great location. I'll be staying there again when next in Lum"
"this is a quiet place with 5 rooms.   fortunately not a party beach, two  restaurants near. the hotel is clean and the breakfast was tasty and filling. ( huevos rancheros, omelets etc).  the hotel has kayaks. the water has rocks but you can walk a bit further for a clearer entrance or take a kayak, it is very shallow."
"definitely the most similar place to be at home in the Tulum paradise. You can move anywhere easily, the environment is super relaxed and the owner's attention is incredible.   If your plan is to have a good time and live a pleasant experience, La Negrita is the right place   "
"We Checked in for nine nights at Casa Jacqueline February 17 to  February 26, 2015 [wished we could have moved in] NOTE A hire car is the best way to enjoy your freedom here...  don't moan abt how far out of tulum you are once you get here  The house is a fair way Down on a guarded gated  sandy road... past the BEST clean easily accessible cenote, there's that restaurant opposite it [with cold beer] the folk are lovely ...the beach is just fine past the lizards palm trees  beware of the speed humps in the r"
"If you plan to stay in town, I cannot think of a better place! I spent 4 nights here and didn't want to leave. The hotel is centrally located and about a 4 minute walk to a bank, Batey, Kay Nah, Matcha Mama, and Yoga Dicha.  The pool/garden area is beautiful and there's lot of cool art work around. An ample breakfast of fresh fruit, coffee/tea, orange juice, and toast is served each morning. The rooms are big, clean, and comfortable with both an AC unit and ceiling fan.  But the hospitality is what really m"
" the room. Wifi in the room is very strong, so neither were missed. - If you need an iron, ask the front desk and they'll get one for you. - The entrance is on Satelite. Go to the larger gate and you'll see a door bell. - There are a lot of dogs in the area, so if you're afraid of dogs or bothered by barking, the area may not be for you. - There's a lot of construction in the area. Bring sneakers as some nearby streets are dug up and rocky. Again, the area, not the hotel."
"Superb hostel: the rooms are clean and nice / the atmosphere is very warm and easy to meet / the location is top notch near all transport, restaurants and shops / and the owners are lovely.  Excellent value.  Only downside: provide only a blanket but no sheets."
This is the hidden gem of tulum. The better marketed hostels actually suck. Sergio and Sabrina and the coolest staff ever and they all treat us like family. Kitchen is great. Netflix and super comfy. Love Lum x
"We stayed for 1 week here. We were looking to get away from the busy feel of Tulum beach. This was a perfect find for us! Might be TOO quiet for some! It is the best affordable place I found on the beach. Nothing fancy but clean, quiet, very friendly staff, large rooms (all with ocean views). Started the day with a great breakfast sitting on the upstairs patio over the beach. We used the free kayaks very day to explore the coast and to paddle out to the reef and snorkel. Took LONG walks to the south. The en"
 Caribbean sunrise is to b remembered and the front watercascade filled pool is just enough to end a day of discovery with a Margarita  Reeeeelaxxxxx. with no cares You'll want to stay in this one spot and go no where else   TBH apart   from main meals ...which using your intelligence is easily fixed.. CASA JACQUELINE has everything you need for a simple three /four day  go nowhere CHILLAX  with a car a perfect out of the way hideaway

"Stayed there one night. Came in without reservation and was warmly welcomed by a french couple and the volunteers.  The hostel is kept tidy, 10min after I showered, someone was already cleaning the bathroom I used. Same for the room, really clean sheets, pillows, comfy mattresses, but reduced spaces. Only 6 beds per dorm. AC works good.  Atmosphere intimate, relaxed. They have all the amenities like being at home, with a great open kitchen, 3 chilling areas, one with sofa, tv, and a bookshelf with boardgame"
 to walk back and forth to the highway! A nice cenote about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. And a few restaurants there also!
"Awesome location, quiet, tranquil and secluded! The breakfasts were out of this world! Each morning we were greeted with a huge selection of fruits, yogurt, granola, hot coffee and cream. That was just the warm up for the main course, which was totally different each day. I personally loved the eggs and chorizo and the fresh radishes and pico. And not to mention a pitcher full of the sweetest orange juice (freshly squeezed each morning) you’ll ever drink. If you’re lucky, sweet Peggy (grounds security) will"
"Small, warm and friendly! The staff go out of their way to help you with anything you need, water, towels, directions and aim to please. Our room was overlooking the main street with a lovely large balcony. It can be a bit noisy, but isn't anything you can't sleep through. The pool was clean and lovely to swim in anytime of the day. The artwork was cool and very Tulum. We found the experience better for having stayed here."
"We spent 6 nights here and had a very relaxing, enjoyable stay. The room was clean and comfortable, and the garden area is beautiful - the pool is small but perfect for a refreshing dip. The staff were friendly and always around to offer chilled water and clean towels for the pool area. Location is good, just 3 short blocks from the main road through Tulum, but very quiet. Bike rental is reasonably priced and convenient, and all the places we were given breakfast vouchers for were great (Ki'bok, Batey and L"
 be back soon!

" when we arrived.  Comfortable bath robes were provided as well.  There is no TV in the room (don't need one, you're not there to watch TV).  Wifi worked great, no issues streaming music or sending messages.  The rooftop was great for relaxing, napping and a view of the ocean. Pool area is cozy and secluded, perfect for refreshing after being in the hot sun.  The hosts were very gracious and provided options for things to do around the area. If you’re looking for a spot to do nothing but unwind and relax, y"
"We stayed there for 6 days and I have to say that it was the most relaxing, cool and amazing hotel I've ever stayed in my life. All the staff was amazing and friendly. The room was exactly as booked. We fell in love with the yard of course. most of our nights we spend there just lying in the hammock reading and talking. It was all the vibe of the hotel that was relaxing and nice. The room was clean as well as the pool and every space in the hotel.   We had 3 options for breakfast which were all really close"
 I will definitely stay there again.
"I had such a blast in Lum Hostel, highly recommended!  The hostel has a great location, only a short walk away from the nightlife hot spots and good restaurants. They offer free bikes which allows you to have a nice bike ride with your new friends to the most beautiful beaches. Lum's staff is great and very knowledgable. They explained and showed us everything we needed and took us onto some bar crawls and night.  Amazing showers too!"
"This is definitely the best hostel in Tulum! I loved everything about it. The decor and the building is nice, the common areas are great for socializing, the rooms and beds are comfortable and clean. The Aircon works very well! The staff is amazing and ensures that you have great stay. Perfect for solo travellers. They have activities you can join and free bikes to use.  Don't look any further, just book it! "
…
We stayed here for 3 nights earlier this week and it was a lovely stay!  Simple rooms but very clean with comfortable beds and a good shower (hot water and good pressure).   The free bikes are a major perk though be advised many visitors lock them the night before to hold the best bikes for themselves so you might want to do the same.  The breakfast is simple but the kitchen is communal which we took full advantage of.  The location is great - close to everything but not in the middle of it so no noise issu

"Lum is the perfect hostel to get a taste of downtown Tulum. Everything in town is walkable including the bus station to get you to and from the airport. The hostel is very cozy, rooms are very clean and secure. Bike rentals are included for slightly further destinations like some ruins, cenotes, and the ocean. The staff is super helpful with anything. I would definitely stay here again and almost enjoyed my stay at Lum more than my stay on the water. Note- if you want to just lay on a beach all day, stay cl"
"I stayed in Lum Hostal for two nights and wish I stayed there longer. Such a cool space with great decor, comfortable beds and extremely clean. Everything was perfect but the best part of the hostel was the personnel and the amenities. I loved the volunteers, you could tell they cared so much about the place and gave 100% to the guests. This says a lot about how great the management is!!! They have free activities everyday and that allows you to meet other travelers super quickly. The bikes are also include"
This place is everything advertised and more!  Breakfast was gourmet every morning by the professional chef Jacqueline. Best coffee in town!   It is tucked away from town and crowds but not too far that anywhere you wanted to go was a short trip in the car.  The beach is there for walks in am and pm and restaurants/beach bars are within walking distance if you just want to hide out and not get in a car.There is scuba down the road as well.  The roof has a amazing view along with being a nice place to relax 
 great deal.  (Tip - If you book directly you can get a better price)   I would definitely stay there again.
"Christmas week spent at Casa Jacqueline was the exact experience my husband and I were looking for. Tucked away down a quiet dirt road across from the beach and about 4 miles from Tulum center. You will want a car.  If you are more of an all inclusive, every luxury mega resort kind of person, this would not be for you. But it was the perfect spot to head out exploring the Mayan ruins at Tulum, Coba and Muyil. It was the perfect spot for visiting birding and wildlife parks at Si'an Kaan and Punta Laguna.  We"
"Aside from the great location, this hostel is a no-no. As a member of group travel trip with G Adventures, we stayed at this hostel for 2 days in February. Upon arriving, the outside looks very good, but looks can be deceiving. The main area is pretty spacious. It feature multiple couches to lounge around, as well as some literature and pamphlets to read. There's a front desk and beside the front desk is a bar, as well as an outdoor patio area, kitchen, and upper deck. Our group was split into 4 groups - 2 "
"A lovely ho(s)tel close to a bus station? It is possible! Super clean, lovely decoration, friendly and helpful staff and a nice pool area to start your day or 'recover' after a journey or day in town. It has dorms but it felt more like a boutique hotel than a hostel. If you want a quiet place close to the center and bus station than I can only recommend this place. I don't often write reviews but liked Amorcita Corazon so much that it is with pleasure that I write this."
…
"Me and my friend spent 3 night here in January, and everything was perfect. The room with AC and wifi, the breakfast and most of all the owner Lourdes who is the heart and soul of Villa Matisse. She is very nice and friendly... always ready to help you. Villa Matisse is also in a very good location. Recommended!"
" and talent by Jackie. Each morning started with fresh fruit and coffee followed by something exceptionally delicious.  Jackie was also happy to share ideas on things to do or restaurants.  A fun and charming hostess.  We loved the deck overlooking a pretty blue tiled pool and generous size of the red room.  The roof deck was the perfect spot for a glass of wine at sunset one evening.  Casa Jacqueline is a colorful, charming bit of tropical paradise."
" biggest issue is the fact that the shower would flood whenever we took showers. Water every where! The shower head had lime deposits on it so, if you turned on the shower, some of the holes were blocked and would spray all over the place. Soooo frustrating. No full body mirror available, no outlets in the bathroom. I could go on and on. Staying on the first floor also meant noise all night long from their parties, but not terrible. I'll say it probably ended around 12-1am, not bad. But you could still hear"
"I couldn't have chosen a better hostel for my Tulum stay. The girl from Uruguay working at the reception (sorry I forgot your name!) does an amazing job. She is helpful, always smiling and provides great customer service. I had asked to change the room (it was just a matter of personal preference, the room was perfectly fine but I asked if we could be transferred to a different one further back) and she and the manager accommodated us without question.  The hostel has great WiFi, a nice rooftop terrace with"
"Lourdes is an excellent host and I loved the coziness to the place.  Conveniently located on a side street off the main drag, you're within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and convenience stores but far from the insanely loud music.  The room itself was spacious and clean but there is no AC or TV.  There was always hot water in the shower and plenty of space for your belongings.  There is also a communal kitchen available for personal use and it was always very, very clean."
…
"I’d give Jungle Keva 5/5 stars. 11 of us visited for a bachelor party recently and it fit us comfortably. Extremely clean, nice pool and kitchen, private pods for each bedroom, and awesome built-in home speakers.   Kendall and Rob were excellent hosts and helped us schedule everything we needed for the long weekend. We spent a lot of time down at the beach bars by Taboo (15 min drive) so needed to coordinate rides accordingly. The staff on site was also excellent…Jose and Jesus will take great care of you. "
…
"This hostel has a good atmosphere, and a lot of offer if you want to get busy. The coffee in the morning and you get some breakfast included. It is a bit noisy at night. so if you want a quiet hostel this is not the place for you.we loved it there and we are not young people."
"5 nights spent here, and it was PERFECT for our needs. rooftop swimming pool, free breakfast with great selections of fruits, yogurt and cereals, less than 5 minutes from the bus station, tons of shops and restaurants within the area, bike rentals, air conditioning. Clean rooms, lovely little balcony (which was great for drying the dive gear :-)). If I'm back in Tulum, I will definitely stay here again. Very chill place with lovely character. They were also kind enough to print some tickets for me when I fo"
"This was my second time staying at Villa Matisse, on a cave diving holiday. Lourdes, the owner, is very friendly and helpful The rooms are clean, with ceiling and pedestal fans and a shower. There is wifi and a nice breakfast. There is a central fridge where you can store your own stuff. Restaurants are close by and so is the supermarket. Tulum is the centre of ""cave Mecca"". Xibalba, the dive school, is  close by, so it is easy to get your tanks for a day diving (if you are a certified cave diver)."
 the Jungle Keva!
"To be fair it was the biggest dorm room we were in for 8 of us, but the room was down a narrow corridor. The location of the power plugs were inconsistent for the beds - there was only 3 plugs in the room which also had two fans (only one worked), thankfully there was an AC. The floor of the room was very uneven, had different levels of concrete in some places. The location was good for the restaurants and shops on the main roads."
"This is one of the best hostels I have ever stayed in. The staff are helpful, friendly and remember your name. Tanya especially makes you feel that you belong there. There is pure drinking water available at all times, to refill your bottles. The hostel is inviting, breezy and spotlessly clean. My dorm room had a balcony and another window into the courtyard. The bathroom is en-suite. The entry lobby has comfortable chairs, swings and an open air courtyard. The rooftop has a small pool, deck chairs, and a w"
"Owner Lourdes is the heart and soul of Villa Matisse. Lovely little hotel in the town of Tulum, close to a multitude of restaurants and shops. Rooms are simple (no A/C) but clean and comfortable. Nice breakfast every morning with coffee, juice and pastries. It's a quick taxi ride to all the attractions in Tulum."

"My fave hostel so after 5 years I obviously came back to it! Extremely satisfied as alwyas. Now the hotel is located right behind the main avenue so away from the traffic bustle and good sleep guaranteed  Free drink every evening, free salsa lessons, karaoke, free pool (an adittion!)..Great staff; their world-embracing smiles all over the place make you feel welcome all the time. The owner Abraham always there to help! Comfortable, clean beds; generous breakfast..until 11h! Worth every penny, so make it a s"
" site too.  The beds are proper mattresses and very comfortable. They come with bedspreads. The whole place has achieved the look and feel of comfort and homey ness that makes feel so good when you come home. The breezeways, the plants, the decorations and a friendly face at the front desk who welcomes you home by name  You cannot find a better place, ever."
"Stayed 4 nights. The room is somewhat basic with no air conditioning,  TV or fridge. But it is clean and large enough with 2 double beds and a ceiling and pedestal fan. There is also a large hammock in the room. The location is quiet and fairly central to everything.the free bikes were well used and a money saver. The breakfast is a serve yourself continental breakfast and there is a fridge there for your use. A lot of the reviews mention the owner as a major positive, and she truly is. She is so friendly a"
"Cant say enough positive things about Jungle Keva and the hospitality shown by Kendall and her team. A group of 15 close friends and I spent a long weekend at Jungle Keva and had a fantastic time. The accomodations are top notch - clean, comfortable, luxurious. The space has great social area for groups especially. Kendall was an incredible host, helping us plan and execute the trip, arranging chef and bar service, outings, etc. her hospitality was the highlight of our trip… she got us medicine when a frien"
Me and my friend Meg were meant to stay in tulum for 3 days but we ended up staying 6 weeks!!! This was all down to the amazing-ness and magic of the weary traveler! Not just because it is a beautiful hostel with a bad ass pool and free drinks every night but because the staff and the people that stay their are some of the best people you’ll ever meet! The people who run it became such life long friends as they are the loveliest and kindest people you’ll ever meet! You’ll have too much fun if you stay there
…
this is one of the best hostel/hotel in tulum it is clean and very well maintained the pool is just about perfect for a beach town this was our second stay at amorcito we found that the hotel is as good if not better as last year the town has lost its flavor and the quality has gone down and the  prices have increased many of the businesses have been bought out by non mexicans
"We stayed here for 4 nights during our stay in Tulum. It is a few steps away from the main road so maybe there is a little bit less traffic noise. The rooms are tidy and clean but nothing special. The manager was nice but he did not speak any english. They have bikes which you can borrow to ride to the beach for free. The breakfast is basic, but ok. Wi-Fi existed, but at least in our room the connection was poor."
"I stayed at Jungle Keva as part of a yoga retreat and found it to be the most incredible and magical experience.  If you are looking for a peaceful, zen place to unwind that does not skimp on the details, this is your location.  The rooms were GORGEOUS, especially the bathrooms.  Because we were in a group, we had the entire facility to ourselves.  I can't speak highly enough of Kendall and her staff's attention and assistance, including restaurant, beach, and transportation recommendations.  I read other r"

"We check in for 20 days in a private room here my girlfriend and I!!!  Good balance between privacy and meeting people.   It is located in town at 30 minutes bicycle ride from the beach near very good restaurant and night life... Right behind Ado bus station.  There is also dormitory, rooftop pool, and shared-kitchen.  We were charmed by the lovely staff and manager!!!    Definitely recommend this place!!  Sébastien and Marie"
Lourdes has a warm friendly laid back style. Very welcoming & helpful. Room was clean and very comfortable. Great value. Complimentary coffee every morning to get you on your way.   Use the free bikes to get to get to the beach. The stretch past Posada Lamar seemed best.  
" located in the strip of chain hotels near the beach, but is a short walk to the downtown Tulum area if you are interested in enjoying the local scene.  JK is also a quick taxi ride to several of the Tulum beach clubs- the taxi services are safe and reliable in Tulum when booked through the hotel.  If you are a social media influencer on vacation with your friends, THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE with its aesthetically pleasing grounds, gorgeous colors, and breathtaking pool.  Thank you Kendall and staff for a rela"
Great hostel has a nice  pool and free caiphrina hour what's not to love. We had a double room with ac and private bathroom. Showers where hot bed was comfortable and the AC was much needed in the hot mexico sun. 
"I attended Life Source’s Dia de los Muertos retreat over Halloween. This retreat was the perfect mind, body, and soul vacation; not to mention a vacation that I didn’t need to take a vacation from my vacation! I returned home rested, refreshed, clear headed, inspired, and motivated to take my life on by storm and get into action.   Life Source’s retreat was the perfect balance of free time, tourism, and a multitude of workshops to help with my spiritual growth and learning.  I had plenty of time to enjoy th"
"Clean, quiet & right behind the bus terminal. Desk staff is very personable.  Breakfast is continental & has plenty of options. The pillows were like concrete so not great sleep our 1st nite.   Asked for others for 2nd nite & the replacements were small & still very firm.  No wifi or TV in room which was disappointing for the price. Rooms are not real spacious.  We needed to turn off outside hall lights as they shone into window by bed.  Good AC. Needs more clothesline space for drying clothes."
"I was so tired after so many flights and hours of traveling and this place was just like water in the middle of the desert. Really beautiful, simple and clean. The dorms are just amazing, new beds and clean blankets, A/C, cleand bathrooms with hot water.  Breakfast is good, fruits are available, they clean the dorms everyday and the recepcionists are sooo cute and responsible, friendly and smiling. They know their job, bilingual and with nice tips."

" about Life Source retreats is the fact that everything offered on the “schedule” was completely optional, not mandatory, and absolutely no pressure to attend if you needed some me time! I personally participated in everything as I didn’t want to miss out on a single thing.   Greeting the sun every morning with our Shaman, Avelino, followed by yoga, and a group breakfast, set each day off to a magnificent and positive start as well as quickly got our group comfortable and acclimated to each other; it was as"
Jungle Keva is the MOST beautiful place I have ever stayed! The atmosphere is incredible and the staff is so incredibly friendly and kind. The owner Kendall is so accommodating and truly the most wonderful host who will gladly help you explore Tulum in whatever way you want. The food was absolutely incredible and the presentation was just as good. I felt so amazing here. It was the perfect place to refresh and unwind. YOU MUST GO! ❤️
"It’s a great place to relax, there’s no many places with no workers behind you like mosquitos and I really appreciate it!!!. So if your the kind of person who like to have waiters, chefs, room service etc... This is not the place for you. Just the basic to feel free. What I don’t like it’s the salty water for shower, beds are too hard for me I would like a nice mattress beside the hard mattress. Also the bar Eufemia it’s on one side the hotel and it’s always crowd and with music too, if want a no noisy plac"
The most relaxing place I’ve ever stayed at.  Room was extremely comfortable — very quiet; windows on three sides with screens and shutters; porch overlooking the ocean (two chairs and two hammocks!).  Comfortable beach lounge chairs with umbrella.  Lots of restaurants in walking distance.  
…
"Beyond the unique design there are a few things travelers should be aware of.   I was not aware there was no AC only a ceiling fan which did little to cool in 80 degree heat at night.  Many bugs including large spiders in room.  Isolated to an extreme.  so far away from anything that if you don't have a car a taxi is needed.  No hot water at the end of the day.  Also rock hard mattress on top of a concrete pad, hard pillows and scratchy over starched linens.  My dog has better accommodations when boarding. "
"Hotel Amoriera is the perfect place to relax and unwind. We stayed there 5 nights and enjoyed our time. The room was rustic, but large and comfortable. We love that there is not air-conditioning - we kept the windows open to the breeze and the sounds of the waves. The breakfast was simple, yet delicious. We ate when we wanted, and were served within minutes of sitting down in the open air breakfast area. The shared kitchen is large and clean. Though we chose to eat in restaurants for our other 2 meals, we n"
" My highest praise, however, is reserved for the staff.  I was so relaxed in Tulum that I left my passport in the hotel safe and didn't realize it until we arrived at our next destination on Cozumel.  The hotel staff immediately discovered my mistake and tried to contact me by phone and email. After a few email exchanges, we decided to meet up with Juan (a hotel employee) in Playa Del Carmen. We met at the agreed meeting spot and made the exchange. I offered,insistently, to pay him for his effort, but he re"

We were never notified until the night before arrival when they said they would honor our reservation that we made directly with them on our last stay. We arrived yesterday to find it in chaos, and the lovely simple beach bungalow we are paying $250 a night for has been stripped of most of its furnishings and is now ridiculously overpriced!!!

"I was long overdue for not only a vacation, but one that focused on my entire wellbeing; physical, emotional, mental and spiritual. Never in my life have I experienced such an intense and life changing place and group of people. Not only did I feel completely at home, safe and surrounded by love and great energy, but also felt incredible support from Michele and her wonderful team. This may have been my first, but definitely not my last!!"
Full disclosure that (a) I am a first time traveler to Tulum and therefore did not know the area when I booked; and (b) I did not do my usual fastidious research before booking my stay here having only read the most recent TA reviews plus the Tablet Hotels description of the property. Had I read all the reviews or looked more closely at the Lodge’s own website I likely would not have booked Jungle Keva given my specific needs during my stay. This is in no way Jungle Keva’s fault or any real criticism of the

"The location is awesome, right in the middle of shops and restaurants and a market right next door. It is also located next to a beach bar Le Eufemia which is fun. The hotel feels like a tree house and is super cute and authentic. They have bikes for rent at 150 MXN a day which is convenient. You will hear the ocean loud and clear as you fall asleep - positive to me but light sleepers may need earplugs. The little hummock's right in front of each room and chairs to lounge are a nice touch.  Things to note: "
" situation at all. Had no electricity for 12 hours last night, which I believe happened all along the beach. So perhaps no fault but they should have generators. The restaurant is only open till 2pm and there is no more drinks service on beach. We have written a rave review about Tita Tulum in our blog but we now must say do not come here unless they again become the lovely property they once were. And if booked already. Get a refund. "
"This retreat was unlike any other I've attended!  From the moment I arrived I knew this place was magical.  Each day was a new level of self awareness and self love.  Life Source Retreats was much more than a luxury vacation with great food, it was life changing and gave me the tools to bring back to my day to day life.  Thank you Life Source Retreats and be back soon!"
" healthy fruit/veggie shakes as an option which does not cost a lot. There is security on site but saw the guy sleeping at night (around 10 pm) when we were walking in - not reassuring.  All in all a nice place, clean and cannot go wrong being right on the beach.  At $250.00 a night slightly overpriced but would stay again.  "

"I participated in a group retreat in October of 2016.  I had recently gone through a break up and was a little intimidated traveling out of the country alone to interact with a bunch of strangers.  Life Source understood my fears and met me at the airport in with refreshments and an airconditioned van.  I was welcomed by Michele and the Shaman Aveleno within minutes of my arrival.  Within days I felt reconnected to source and rejuvenated.  I received a healing by the Shaman, Mayan clay cleansing, and a swea"
"Stayed in a sea view room - and what a view!  It was fantastic to wake to the waves rolling in on the shore and look at the water.  The rooms are built into the treetops  and you walk around on small pathways in the trees as well.  It’s a small and cozy hotel.  Breakfast is ok, and there is a good and cheap beach bar right next door.  I hope to come back! "
"We loved the room and the hospitality of the staff. The room was relaxing and left you feeling isolated from everything around you. But then you can simply wander down the beach or street and reach any of the amenities and popular spots in Tulum. The tree house feel was awesome and the breakfast everyday was enjoyable. From the bad reviews I've seen, it sounds like the reviewers would have been better suited at a more generic all-inclusive. If you want an escape with a slightly rustic feel then look no furt"

"I'm still on a spiritual high from my amazing experience at LSR's Live Life on Purpose/Laws of Attraction retreat.   The accommodations were just what the doctor ordered, as I looked out from my bed at the white Tulum sands and heard the waves hitting the beach. The food was both healthy and delicious, and the attention to detail from Michele and her team was second to none.   In addition to all of that, the information I gleaned through a week of hard spiritual work and shard experience with a handful of c"
"What a beautiful spot! Our room overlooked the beach, but it felt very private. Very bright and clean rooms which had been recently painted. The full breakfast every morning was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious. The communal kitchen is fully stocked if you feel like preparing your own food.

"Tita Tulum is an amazing Ecological friendly Hotel, we stayed there one night. The scenic view to the ocean was amazing. The room was comfortable and spacious. We loved the trees and plants surrounding all the rooms at the hotel.  The hammocks looked appealing, unfortunately were dirty and sticky, we could not used them. However, a couple of wooden chairs at the porch room were a great place to rest and enjoy the breeze."
"I cannot begin to explain how magical, transforming, relaxing, and amazing this past week has been for me.  I found all of the people working for Life Source Retreats professional, warm, amazing energies that were sharing with their gifts whenever possible.  I learned so much in our discussions on Abundance and the Law of Attraction while sitting watching the sunrise with our amazing Shaman, our fantastic morning yoga sessions, enjoying all the healthy, delicious food, discussions, excursions and the peacef"
" fully relax in my room for the stay for this reason. - Moderately priced, but after the experience with roaches, this place became very overpriced for extremely basic accommodations - No hot/warm water entire stay - didn't mind during the day, but wished for at least an evening comfortable shower - Used credit card to pay my balance when checking in, paid a fee (expected), then watched others check in and there's the option to Venmo or Paypal transfer.  For some reason I wasn't offered this option so paid "
"I rented two rooms at the TiTa Tulum, one for my husband and I and the other for my mother. From the moment we checked in, we were welcomed warmly and made feel at home and at easy. The rooms are spacious with full ocean view, plenty of hot water and overall exceptionally clean and neat. The breakfast was delicious and served each morning on the restaurant deck overlooking the waves. Just gorgeous!!!! There was security posted at the main gate and at the entrance from the beach which contributed to the feel"
"I spent a week with Michelle and her team and they made my days! The atmosphere they created around and the beauty of the location, the sound of the sea and the ocean... The visit to the Cenote, the clay, the mayan ruins... It's been such a fantastic week! People in the hotel are helpful and friendly, food is deliciuos, what else can i ask for?"

 planning a return trip in September for my b-day! :)

"I just returned from LSR's Power Light: The big Leap and I am still processing just how much of an impact this retreat has had for me during and after my stay. It truly has been life changing. The workshops, excursions, awesome team, accommodations, and food are all top notch. The people I have met in the 5 days are nothing short of incredible and am thankful for the friendships forged.  Michele and team - Thank you! Life Source Retreats was an experience of a lifetime I will never forget.  My advice...Just"
"We went to the restaurant ""Garden"". The best food in Tulum! They have an Italian Michelin star chef! Unique mix of modern Italian fusion with Mexican flavors. My favorite plate? Octopus! The place is not unique as maybe somewhere else.."
"This place feels like a special hidden jem in the heart of Tulum. It is not “hidden” by any means (right next to many trendy restaurants and resorts) but has a super low-key feel and is just so relaxing. We stayed with our two young children (1 and 4 years old) and it was perfect for them. We really enjoyed the food at the restaurant and ate there a lot, or could also easily walk up the beach or down “beach road” for other options. The bungalows are rustic and perfectly suited to the atmosphere. We stayed i"
"The retreat in Cuba was wonderful in every way. We were well prepared thanks to Christina answering our numerous emailed questions quickly and patiently! The schedule was full of interesting and relevant activities including yoga every morning, sightseeing around Havana, a day at the beach, having the opportunity to support local artists and meeting interesting people wherever we went. Karolina, who lives in Havana and is very knowledgeable, was our guide and constant companion. She made every hour worthwhi"
"Don't recommend and way overpriced at $500 per night.  We got to tulum, playa mambo and once we saw that the room we definitely changed our mind to stay 5 nights.  We decided to stay one night and were forced to pay a 2 night minimum.  Place wasn't nice at all vs the pics online.  Weeds everywhere, beach area was dirty."
"I wish I could give 10 stars! I participated in the Holbox retreat and it exceeded all expectations. The accommodations were incredible, the attention to detail and the personalization that Christina treats each person with is incomparable. All the organized events we did were so special and respectful of the local culture. Everything is optional and has a very laid back feel- but extremely organized and professional at the same time! Yoga teacher Sherry Sidoti is gracious, humble, respectful and just a won"
"First impressions were great, looked like a nice place to eat. The hostess advised it was cash only and as we didn't have cash we went to leave, the hostess then said we could pay by transferwise and we agreed to do that.  Sat down ordered food, the staff at this point were all very polite and nice. The food was average and actually very overpriced but this wouldn't of been an issue but for the rudeness at the end.  When I asked for the bill another woman came over and said I believe you are paying by trans"
"I stumbled across Playa Mambo by chance, and what a find! It really is such a gem, Tulum is an incredible place but my stay at Playa Mambo really made it. First of all, everyone who works there is super nice and friendly! From check-in, to the staff in the restaurant and beach club. Nothing was too much effort. The accomodation was just perfect.. comfy bed with decent mozzie net, air con (during the eve), really great beachy decor, huge bathroom with hot water. I stayed in one of the cabanas in the middle o"
" cocktails! Included brekky was basic but very fresh.  Location-wise I was very happy, it’s a little far from the busier end of town (Matteos, etc) but an easy taxi ride. Lots of cool shops and cafes/restaurants/bars nearby All in all I’m blown away by my experience here and can’t wait to come back. One of the best places I’ve ever stayed! Not quite sure how it was such good value compared to other Tulum accommodation but I think it will be more expensive in high season. That said, I’ll pay it!"
"Out of the city chaos, you find this lovely and reserved spot, with differentiated service, local and homemade breakfast, and fantastic people. Chelo, since the beginning, was extremely attentive and also a great communicator. She was fast answering the emails, and once I got there, she provided me with ALL the information I needed to move around Tulum - including maps with distance and details.  You can choose to be in a private or in a shared hut (like in a hostel). This last option was my type of accommo"
"Stop what you’re doing and immediately book a retreat with Christina and YAWW! After a life altering experience in Havana with my sister travelers and the Cuban people, I’ve already reserved a spot for Santorini in Sept! Christina KNOWS all the things ... where to go, who to see, what to eat, what to do ... we were always safe ... and always laughing! If you seek peace AND fun memories Christina has GOT you!"
"Highly recommended organization to travel to Havana, Cuba. We went on a Support for the Cuban People trip that included daily yoga and lots of opportunities to interact with Cubans. Christina is highly responsive and assuaged any possible concern we as Americans might have about traveling to Cuba in an environment where the rules and requirements are changing. All the logistics for small group travel were organized without any issues and the entire trip went smoothly. Accommodations were in a casa particula"
" exception for you.""   She was extremely rude with the way she spoken to us and ruined our night.  For future reference you can pay by email, the recipient simply needs to input the bank details instead of forcing the sender, in my case customer to do it.   Also don't advise customers this is a payment method if you are going to be so rude about it afterwards. It really let down the whole experience. If you don't want to take card payments because you want to avoid taxes, I actually have no issues with that"
…
"The staff provided exceptional service, were friendly and very helpful. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome. They helped us with our bags, offered helpful advice and made me feel like I was home.  The location looks just like a postcard. White sand beach, swaying palm trees, beach bar, and comfortable beach beds and chairs. We were offered complimentary drinks (highly recommend the cuba libre and margarita). The continental breakfast was delicious and also complimentary. We stayed"
" hostel, but it included the delicious breakfast and bikes to be used during my whole stay (this because the hostel is a bit far from the city center). It was quite easy and fast to get to the beach by bike (since in Tulum the Taxi service is very expensive, with fixed fees).   The common areas are also enjoyable, with hammocks, chairs, and tables to enjoy a sunny morning and afternoon. And they also care about recycling, which I lovely!  I totally recommend this place. You get your own keys and are free to"
"Love Christina and YAWW! I did a retreat in Tulum and every single aspect of the week was dialed in perfectly. Vibes, space, food, yoga, activities and the people. Christina knows what she's doing and I look forward to joining another adventure! I recommend for a first timer or someone who is looking to fill their cup with a new adventure!"
"Went to Cuba last year with YAWW and two friends and had the BEST time! The itinerary was perfect. Christina and Sofi are wonderful hosts. I always talk about what an amazing time I had in Cuba, which is not always everyone's experience visiting Cuba, so I feel very lucky that YAWW provided us with such a great experience. One of my top trips. Highly recommend this company!"
…
"I was in contact with the owner via WhatsApp because I had so many questions before I checked into Chill Inn. They were really attentive in answering all my questions.   I arrived in Tulum at 10 pm because I was taking the ADO bus from Chiquila late afternoon and it took me forever to get there. It has been my very first time visiting Tulum after 10 years and it has changed a lot. ( I was a bit stressed as I was not able to use any ATMs to take money out because they all were out of cash, so I thought I won"

"Christina is an excellent host because she is preternaturally cool and finds her way to the best corners of anywhere she travels. #Art, #feminism, #love, #yoga, #consciousnesses raising, genuine laughter, great food & drinksss...bespoke experiences...what else do you want?!"
"This place is amazing, the setting at the beach is stunning. The food is amazing and the vibe is sublime. We had pasta and grilled shrimps and the kids a pizza margerita, I highly recomment this restaurant for food location and setting! Really a must visit!"
" arrived I was welcomed by a wonderful lady called Theresa, and a very friendly chap called Alex, explaining my cash situation but they let me check-in anyway, so I could pay my entire stay the next day. They went over and above explaining the entire facilities in Spanish. I was really happy getting there.   Things I liked about Chill Inn.  * Spacious dormitories, each bed comes with curtains, so you can have some privacy.  * Every dormitory has its own spacious bathroom and toilet * Fan is provided in each"
"Chelo the owner of this property is so warm and welcoming, she really makes this place amazing. The road noise is easily blocked out by some ear plugs but it is worth baring for the great location. 5 min really enjoyable cycle to the beach - 10 mins into town. The breakfast was amazing and she had no problems catering for vegans.   Gracias Chelo "
"LOVE Y&AWW! Just returned from an epic, restoring, FUN retreat (Cuba!!!) with smart, beautiful fellow travelers; a lovely yogi and founder Christina and I'm only mad I waited so long. Don't even hesitate - these folks are pros and attract strangers who will become friends. See you on the next adventure!"
"I was told about this restaurant by a fellow Mexican friend, and my partner and I thought to try it out as she had such great things to say.   It is located at the start of the Tulum strip, with needing to walk through a little botanical garden to get there. It was so charming and sweet!  The restaurant has excellent sea views and lots of seats inside and outside. The staff were great and had very thorough knowledge on the menu, flavours and ingredients. The food itself was delicious - there is no other exp"
"Special mention to Gustavo. He looked after us so well while we were waiting for a late bus. Very friendly, incredibly helpful and genuinely wants to get to know and talk to you ! Such a good guy and very hospitable. Best shower and the beds were soft and really comfy. Gave us great information about the activities to do around the area. Bikes are 80 pesos with a company two blocks away !. Great idea and biked to the local Cenotes. Fruit and eggs for breakfast the next day ! Yum ! Again Gustavo is a hero 👍🏽"
…
"Super chill hostel for solo travelers or groups close to downtown.  Has everything you need: bike rental, lockers, luggage storage, kitchen, privacy curtains - and delicious home cooked breakfast every morning. Laid back, friendly atmosphere."
"Not only is it the nearest hostel to the Tulum beach. It is the cleanest, friendliest and most beautiful hostel I have stayed in. It is not a party hostel at all and there are only a handful of other people staying which made it calm and quiet. Chelo runs the hostel with her son and they make you feel like you are a part of their family. It is their home too. Chelo makes breakfast every morning of fresh fruit followed by something hot (different every day). There are bikes to use to cycle into Tulum or to t"
I had never been interested in group organized travel prior to going on a retreat with Yoga Adventures Worldwide and now I can't imagine traveling without Christina and her wonderful crew. The yoga instructor was the best I've ever had and created a truly amazing environment for my mind and body. The accomodations and excursions were lovely and very good value. You won't regret traveling with Yoga Adventures!
" those who wants to give him hugs and kisses :)  If we had time, we would have visited again for lunch and dinner. Thanks for an amazing experience guys!"
great 2 days at El Jardin de Frida. Staff where very helpful and friendly. very clean room and not crowde. Big kitchen and super healthy breakfast. THen f you want to enjoy a glass of local wine they have this nicely decorated bar. Highly recommended.
If u plan to visit Tulum this place where u need to stay. Staff is very helpfull and place is very clean. Breakfasts are look like familly dinner and ıt fells like home. It is in the center of the town and clıse to everywhere in center
 to kill anything that may be hitching a lift on them after being in so many different rooms. I loved it here!
"I’ve now joined Yoga & Adventures Worldwide on two different retreats, in Morocco and Cuba, and they were both indeed adventures of a lifetime. Christina and Sofi have curated immersive programs where you get to not only practice with amazing yoga teachers from around the world, but explore a new country’s heart and soul from an insider’s perspective. They have taken the time to seek out the best local experiences beyond just the “touristy” stuff. Whether you’re a seasoned yogi, beginner, a solo traveler or"

Diane & her husband were absolutely lovely! They were extremely hospitable. The breakfast she made every day was amazing! We felt completely at home! We would absolutely come back when we are in the Tulum area!
A lovely place to relax after a busy day at the ruins or on the beach. Breakfast is substantial and beautifully served. We had a huge private room with en-suite. Lots of hot water. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook our dinners. Staff were helpful getting us on the right bus for our onward journey. 
"Really chill place with nice tropical hippie vibe. Very well located. Close to colectivo base and central road. Our room for 4 people was with an air conditioner, so it was very comfortable. Kitchen is spacious and has all utilities. Owners are beautiful people. Breakfast prepared by Teresa are delicious, coffee was really good. In hostel are two beautiful cats and two dogs. cutest creatures ever!:) the only thing we didn’t have hot water. but the rest was spotless :)"
"Room was clean and tidy with appropriate storage, bedside power points, lights and fans. Facilities were nice enough and the vibe mellow. Not a party hostel by any means but a good cheap option close to town. Breakfast was cooked on arrival and always tasty. Special shoutout to one of the volunteers, Ethan, who was highly accomodating and always up for a chat and some Tulum tips. Gracias!"
…
"My girlfriend and I stayed here 3 nights but wish we could have stayed MUCH longer! Chelo, the owner, is one of the warmest and most genuine people you could imagine. She took the time to answer our many questions and provided excellent recommendations for both restaurants and activities. Our suite was roomy, private and uniquely decorated.  Bikes and snorkel equipment were included with the room.  The grounds are well maintained and the free breakfasts (actually homemade by Chelo) were incredible! The loca"
"At first we were hesitant to book this place because it didn't show up on google maps (Daria Tulum- the boutique in the hotel did), it's not on Booking, and most of the reviews here are for the restaurant.  But after emailing with Carolina, we finally booked directly off their website (using a credit card) and we are SO glad we did.  We stayed in room 6 with our family of 5 (2 kings, one twin).  This place is stunning and charming at the same time.  The pathway through the property from the road to the rest"
" toast/jam, eggs, smoothies, juice, coffee, etc.) while watching the waves and several evenings we also ate dinner and enjoyed the salads and pastas.  From your room to the beach is just a matter of steps so the kids were able to jump in the ocean whenever we were there, hop out to eat, and go right back in.  There are beach towels, chairs, tables, beds, a swing, and cushioned lounge chairs with umbrellas (first come, first serve and you do compete with restaurant guests, but we usually found a place to sit"
"Two beautiful suites with outdoor private deck on second floor and a hot tub and sitting areas on the third floor.  Wonderful art and artifacts everywhere.  The house is very private located in the woods as is the swimming pool. Diane and Phil are super hosts, but Diane is the star as the gourmet chef.  We were there for a week and never had  the same breakfast  twice.  Always a 4-course meal with fresh fruit and a variety of main courses from Swedish pancakes, various egg dishes, meats, and on and on.  Jus"
"Everything about this place was wonderful - the staff, the gardens, the breakfast, the bed! The location is not quite central but we rented bikes and walked and nothing was too far out of the way! Highly recommend!"
"I’ll make this brief. If you are a racist and on a budget then this is the place for you.   If your not - keep reading. On my checkout day I was seated at the kitchen table preparing to leave and about an hour later, still within the 11:00 checkout timeframe, I said Adios! to the owner and headed to the bus station.   I was maybe 3 steps from the hostel when the owner came out, started yelling and accused me of stealing $400 pesos from her bag. What!? She said that I was the only one in the kitchen and told"
" This was such a lovely experience, I hope to visit again someday!"
…
"5 Stars based on combo of food, hospitality, setting, privacy and amenities. It is hard to overstate the generosity of Diane's breakfasts and her hospitality skills, starting with fresh-squeezed OJ, fresh fruit plates, bottomless coffee and the sounds of Cesaria Evora. She follows this with just the right balance of sweet and savory - we were there for 9 breakfasts and each one was unique and delicious. She bakes incredible breads. Her egg dishes including crustless quiches were over the moon delicious, as "
Very nice hostel!  Lovely garden area.  Bright colourful rooms.  Plenty of bathrooms and the best showers I've encountered in many years of travelling!  No bunk beds.  Very good breakfast included.  Resident dog and cat. Friendly staff.  Only negatives are that the internet reception isn't the greatest in the bedrooms (better in the common area) and the kitchen area is locked overnight.
" to realize SHE HAD THE MONEY ALL ALONG.   My entire time here she was unwelcoming. I checked out when I did because I suspected she was racist, but full proof came today.   I understand and write Spanish better than I speak Spanish and many times she referred to me in derogatory terms along with one of her other volunteers - often starting with “El Negra” and followed by a slew of derogatory references.   I even listened as one of her volunteers had a full on conversation with his friends where he referred"

" rushed. The rooms are beautiful as shown, bed comfortably firm, high quality pillows and sheeting and an endless fresh water source thoughtfully provided. You have your own patio for privacy. Rooms are beautiful but not that large so plan on doing your yoga on the accompanying patio, nice big windows and doors can be left open so the sounds of the ocean are ever-present (in moderate temps which we had in Feb). You will wake to diverse bird songs, 4-5am if you are a light sleeper. Water at the sink lacked h"
"It would be enough to stay here for the tranquility of the garden, and the eccentric yet beautiful bohemian decor. Almost every inch of this place is Instagramable, but it’s the staff that has made it such a lovely stay.  They have been super accommodating and friendly and fun to spend time with as well. The food and drinks are also very good and an added bonus. Will miss this place definitely worth staying in Tulum!!"

"My girlfriend and I were 100% thrilled with our 5 night stay at Casa Del Amor. Highly recommended.  Starting from the top, we LOVED the roof deck, featuring a large hot tub, sun beds, and deck chairs. The deck has a great view for sunset, and an even more special view of the Milky Way each night. There is zero light pollution over the ocean, so millions of stars dance before your eyes.  The bedrooms are very comfortable, featuring private baths, a couch, and a stocked fridge (waters, beers, wine). We had a "
"A good hostel when you are looking for some quiet time. The rooms were a bit dark, garden was lovely aswel as the restaurant/front garden. Its a little bit out of town. But the restaurant across the street was amazing."
"muy buena opcion para descansar con la familia o en pareja, sin duda la atencion de las personas es buena y te dan una calida bienvenida a diferencia de otros lugares,la distancia a los demas lugares es relativamente cerca. sin dudas regresare!"
" won’t find a more enjoyable experience at the best hotel in your city. It’s that good.  We rented a car and found that very helpful to get to the cenotes, lagoon, etc. Dianne has great suggestions for activities so you don’t even have to research a lot before staying here. She also provides gear like snorkeling, life jacket, water shoes, picnic, etc.  We can't wait to return."
"We stayed 3 nights at jardin de frida and were absolutely happy there. It is located in the City center at a busy road. Nevertheless it is quiet due to its cute garden. It is a Bit far to the Beach (and the main touristic area) but you have everything you need: Little shop (oxxo), atm, bike/ motorcycle rental, restaurant (i recommend burrito Amor), Bus station ADO.  The staff (of the Hostel, Restaurant and bar - all 3 Next to each Other in one building) is super friendly and helpful. The breakfast is includ"
 nice Place to stay if you are ok with having to drive to the Beach and dont want to be in the Main touristic/hipster area. 
"Tulum Express Suites fue un hotel excelente en el centro del pueblo de Tulum, Quintana Roo a unos minutos de sus hermosas playas, sus servicios eran basicos con habitaciones comodas y muy limpias con cocina integral e implementos de servicio con aire acondicionado e internet inalambrico sin embargo cerro sus puertas por problemas financieros en 2008 por lo que ahora el edificio es administrado por una nueva empresa en el mismo domicilio."

"Casa Amor Del Sol is a hidden gem on a quiet beach road about 10 minutes from the main town of Tulum. The house is situated across from the beach, in a beautifully manicured jungle setting. Our room was tastefully decorated with local textiles and art, had a fridge, satellite tv, and cd player with a large library of cds. Whether lounging by the pool, upstairs in the jacuzzi or on your private terrace, there are towels for your use and lots of places to relax. Flora and fauna abound, and being a bird watche"

Freshly baked breads and goodies will delight you. We took a few pieces of almond cake home on the plane, it was a treat!  Definitely rent a car so you can follow Diane’s suggestions for outings such as the Coba ruins, a much cooler setting than Tulum because of the jungle setting. And Caleta Tankah, a wonderful beach club with lounge c"
If you are looking for a fancy hotel with all the bells and whistles this might not be the best option. We stayed here for 6 days and the staff was more than friendly.  You can't beat a cheap hotel with a room with a view in a great location.
"We did book a standard bungelow just a 2 days before our arrival half November 2015. What a poor welcome and service! The pool was empty, no breakfast or a small bar where you could take a sip. Due to renovation there was no reception desk. The employee who was taking care of the construction was also taking care of handing out the keys. Strange introduction, definitely no warm welcome from a professional crew! The location is perfect, just along the beach, room was ok. Especially if you don't feel for a lu"
The owner and staff were very nice but the place just started to invest to renovate. I hoop that it will work out. We had a nice time but spend most of our time els ware.  The place is ver y basic and it is named the concrete hotel.
I came to tulum in 2013 and stayed right next to this hotel. there was a taco bar in front. everyone was hanging out. the chairs and mats were out for people to relax. the hotel looked updated and clean. This past week it was a completely different story. taco bar was CLOSED. we were the only people staying there. never put out chairs and mats for us. we never had anyone talk to us. forgot to clean room. pool was dirty. no one cleaned the insane amounts of seaweed on the sand. NEVER STAY HERE. STAFF IS NONE
"I've stayed in several places in Tulum and I spent six weeks doing some budget traveling all over the Yucatan.  This may have been the worst place I stayed in the entire time.  No, the second worst.  But still.  The worst for the price.  I even paid low-season prices so I have no idea how I would feel if I'd paid high season prices.  I think it's clear from the reviews that people who get the budget bungalows here aren't happy and the people who get regular rooms in the main building are okay with it.  I di"
" hotel is to have a place to sit on the beach.  This hotel has a few nice hammocks that I enjoyed, but the small beach area was crowded with hotel guests.  Other hotels have a much nicer beach setup.  Now to the ""bungalows,"" which are one of the better deals on the beach in Tulum, but definitely not worth it.  Tulum is tricky for budget travelers because there is no public transportation between the beach hotels and town.  So you have to decide where to stay and then take a taxi between town and beach, or r"

"The room was nice and the hotel was on the beach, and in a central location. Most important the people were awesome. They truly took good care of us. The hotel was gated with a full time security guard. The manager recommended a great little day trip to a lagoon that turned out to be one of the high lights of our trip. Will definitely go back next year."
"Please do not waste your money, there are tons of nicer places. This was a shoddy place where the price did not reflect the hotel We're travelling and have stayed in some grotty places but we walked out without even staying a night. There was excrement by the pool, the pool looked filthy and the beach had piles of seaweed rotting in front of the loungers. There were plenty of wooden loungers but with no cushions on so you couldn't even use them. The place looked like it hadn't been finished with building wo"
"I saw all the reviews for this place before booking and was very concerned, but I booked it anyway because it was the only place on the beach within our budget. As it happens, we were delightfully surprised and ended up staying an extra night, and wishing we'd stayed an additional night after that rather than heading up to Playa del Carmen as we had planned. It is not a beach resort so the rooms are not as fancy as some of the pricier places, but we had one of the Bungalow cottages which was right in front "
"We are staying in this gem for 2 weeks because it was so awesome. Absolute clean rooms and a great guy running it. Reasonable prices, will definitely retourn when in Tulum again. Herman was a fantastic host. "
This is a comfortable little guesthouse just off the main strip.  The rooms are nice (we stayed on the first floor.  Clean rooms. Breakfast (toast) was questionable! But the staff were incredibly helpful! 
"The hotel is a quiet oasis in the middle of the city with friendly staff and clean room. Breakfast is okay. However, the place does not really offer running water, sometimes no water in the rooms at all. Therefore not recommended. "
"Stayed here as part of a tour group for a couple of nights, this is a small guest house with only 10 rooms but all are comfortable and clean with air con some rooms are bigger than others but our standard room was perfectly acceptable and had plenty of hot water unlike some of the hotels we stayed in on our trip. The rooms are based round a small courtyard with loungers hammock and a small pool. The main shops and restaurants are only a couple of blocks away but the hotel was very quiet. Continental breakfa"

Very nice and quiet place with friendly staff. Good price. Clean room with wi fi. Hotel with breakfast. Fridge available. 10 min. from bus station. It is possible rent the bicycle. We was very happy ☺
"Charming small guesthouse, with just a handful of rooms around a courtyard, with a string of hammocks to chill out in the evening. Quite basic, but rooms get cleaned daily. You can get free coffee and tea with biscuits by reception anytime.   About five minutes walk to the main street of Tulum, with bars and restaurants and tourist shops. The beach is about 10 minutes drive or most tourists hire bikes to get around. People hang around Playa Paradiso beach club, close to Tulum Ruins, where you can either hir"
" a few boats going around, and there is not much to see but sand. We stayed for a week to explore Tulum, went diving in cenotes, and to the nearby Sian Ka'an nature reserve, accessed from the small nearby town of Muyil, for a water ride along the Mayan canal. You can also go to Akumal beach, a bit of a 'tourist trap', about half an hour drive from Tulum to snorkel with enormous turtles and visit Akumal Monkey Sanctuary to take a 2-hour tour to learn about conservation and protection of wild animals."
"Las 5 estrellas son para el lugar que es idílico, playas limpias y el cenote dentro el mar es único.... pero hace unos meses, se volvió carisima la entrada!Además está prohibido entrar con alimentos y bebidas obligándonos  a consumir al restaurante .... Que lastima, era nuestro lugar favorito!!!!!"

"Enjoyed our time for the most part. Convenient location, nice sized rooms, free coffee at the front desk. Nice courtyard for conversation with friends and hammocks for lounging. Close to walking and biking trail.  "
"I found the place perfect, very good location in the town, close to the beach, a cozy and big room, clean, quiet at night and comfy beds and air conditioning. We booked last minute and they managed to find us a very good room for the same price. I recommend it very much. "
"Stayed in a private room.  This hotel is quiet (about ten rooms?) and located very close to the town centre or a 40-80 peso taxi ride to the beach.  The guys on front desk are hilarious, what characters!!!!  So much fun, great service!  They would do anything for you!  This is a clean safe reasonably priced hotel with a good location.  Basic but all you need and hey it has air con which trust me you need in this place!!!  Rooms are spacious with a large bathroom.  Takes a while for the shower to change temp"
"The staff here was incredibly friendly! The rooms are large and clean, and free wifi worked great. The hotel is a little off the main drag of hotels, but was very quiet and safe. My boyfriend and I both agree we had the best sleeps here over any other hotel in our past 3 weeks of travel!   "
"What a gem! We tried to book online and had issues with phone service so we took a trip down the beach to chance a stay. Arrived unannounced and asked if there was a cabana available and had the option of an apartment or beach view private cabana. Definitely opted for the private cabana and it was stellar! If you are looking for a luxury stay, this is not for you but we enjoy a backpacking style, less is more, and rustic is no problem! Private bathroom, clean bed, hammock out front, sleeping with the window"
I had an amazing stay at Hotel Tequila.  Cesar and Salda are very nice and extremely hospitable.  The location is perfect - nestled into a quiet corner of town close to the road to the beach.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  Highly recommend if you're looking for an affordable and clean option in Tulum!
"Hotel Tequila is very clean and well maintained and good value for money. The simple reasonably sized rooms all face an inner courtyard which provides a pleasant place to rest after hot days on the beach. The hotel is situated a few blocks from the main street in Tulum Pueblo where all the restaurants and bars can be found. Just a short walk from the hotel to a large supermarket where you can purchase groceries, wine, beer etc to take back to your room and enjoy cold, thanks to the in-room fridge.  The very"
"If you are looking for a beach to land on in Tulum, come over to CM. They have a laid back beach bar and are happy to offer you some covered beach chairs in exchange for drinking and/or eating from their restaurant and bar. The views are perfect, the beach sand is soft and the water is calm.   As for drinks, you can expect to stick with your basic fruity cocktails or cervezas. They also offer freshly opened coconuts... was able to bring my chilled champagne and have them pour it for me, so long as we spent "
" salsa types and a couple more varieties of dish options.  A bonus, there are lots of talented locals frequenting the bar here, so you'll likely hear some live music later in the day.   We didn't stay in the hotel so my review is based solely on the service we received on the beach from the bar and kitchen. This is a no-frills, super chill place so you can just throw on a suit, a cover up, grab your hat and find your chair in paradise."

"We really loved this place.  It's at the very southern end of the ""hotel zone"" in Tulum on the beach side.  There are even more economical accommodatios at this location not on the beach but we opted for waking up to the waves for a few nights.  Keep in mind, you're paying for the location, not the accomodation itself.  Beachfront bungalow was VERY rustic.  It did have power but to be fair, it was kind of sketchy power.  My girlfriend got shocked trying to unplug the fan when the roof leaked water in.  You "
 We had a car but there is very limited parking in the hotel zone and not really worth driving around there.  We would definitely come here again!

"Not my cup of tea. Originally planning to stay here for 3 nights, but left after just one. Beautiful location, right on the beach and extremely nice ""sitting area"" in the shade of tens of palm trees. Current manager of the cabanas was very friendly, absolutely doing his best to make everyone feel good. But simply too basic for my taste: no chair or table inside cabana, unfortunate positioning of hammock on the deck, no ceiling fan, ants on the wall and salt water in the shower! If you like to sound of the o"
"I at first liked Juan, German and Mario who work there. I am older and was traveliing around Tulum area last fall and winter. At first they gave me a good rate. The longer i stayed the more they charged me until they were charging me the equivalent of a small studio with kitchen even though i had small room. I had hurt my rib and couldn't travel well so was staying on. I tipped very well and i did not feel they were nice after the fact. Some other tourists were also traveling and staying across from me and "

"Very nice small hotel right at the beach. I really liked interior and decor of the place - bohemian, rustic and a bit hipsterish. Every singe detail is thought through and fits perfectly into charming Tulum beach area. Food in the restaurant was delicious and staff vey friendly and helpful. Playa Kin Ha is a real Carribean paradise!"
" wouldn't recommend that place. Surrounded by dogs too. barking all night. The staff does not try to curb bottle rockets during festival times and i suggest staying in an Air b and b outside central tulum because also, the noise of the bands and music playing in clubs are competeing with each other so the noise level is off the charts. In winter is terrible mariachi music all night at Mariachi Loco rest. The worst rest. If you like grease and rude waiters...it's your place."

"Hotel Nadet is the perfect stay. Perfect location with plenty of bars, restaurants, and shops literally 100-500 feet away.   The rooms are spacious, and very clean! Some even have kitchenettes. For $50 a night this is luxury.   You cannot go wrong by staying at Hotel Nadet. "
"My father and I stayed at Hotel Nadet for two days and three nights!   The hotel is small, quiet, & comfortable. I highly recommend it to anyone that really just needs a place to stay.  The hotels location is perfect! Right in the center of the Main Street of Tulum. There is plenty to eat all around it. Breakfast, lunch & dinner. At night the street comes to life with people drinking and having fun.   Totally an experience. Nadet was the best place for us to stay. The room was spacious and very clean. We ha"
Didn't stay at the hotel but were there almost every day. The beach is beautiful and almost always empty. The food is delicious and the staff is more then excellent. They even give you free hummus to snack on. Highly recommend a visit.
"I love this place! It maintains the essence of Tulum, super low key and exclusive, quiet and peaceful, delicious food in La Cocina de Corina, super nice personnel, everyone is making sure that you have the best time, very attentive. Right in the heart of the Tulum beach area, cozy, hammocks, quiet areas, private beach, not crowded, at your convenience. Highly recommend this place for a quiet relaxing stay in Tulum, with amazing people that will respond to anything you might need to make your stay super plea"
"We're couple that just walk in. we paid a four-day advance in cash and in dollars .  On the second day we noticed that we were wrong and in fact we need only three days than- we have a flight .  The hotel owner (which we never saw/talk) not agreed to return us the night that already paid ,  we even offer to take a cancellation fee and return us the rest of the money , we did not get a positive response .

"I was planning to visit Tulum this saturday. I called on thursday to make a reservation, the receptionist told me that there was aviable rooms and he asked for my phone number and my e-mail adress to send me the information so i could make my reservation.  Today is friday at 20:00 and they just called me to tell me that they don't have any rooms aviable, and they are sorry.. What i supose to do now? I'm traveling tomorrow and i don't have any place to stay anymore. Thanks a lot hotel nadet employees."
"The room was exceptionally clean! It was also very spacious. Not much to do at the hotel but who comes to Tulum to stay at the hotel all day and night anyway? It served its purpose, comfortable bed to sleep in , great bathroom with shampoo and even a small kitchen/living area, and the LOCATION was PERFECT. Close to all the restaurants, bars, shops etc. I would stay here again.  The only negative comment is that they don't have where to park your car and that there is not always someone attending in the rece"

Great place to stay i recommend this hotel   "

We absolutely loved our stay at Playa Kin Ha! We stayed in the ocean front room right over main dining area. We spent the evenings sitting on our balcony sipping mezcal and watching the moon rise and went to sleep to the sounds of the waves. If you keep the sliding glass doors open the strong ocean breeze through the screen doors keep the room cool and perfect. The beach in front of the property is perfect and the vibe around the place is quiet but not too far away from the action! Taxis patrol the main dra
"This is a very basic boutique hotel that will meet your needs in a minimal fashion. We stayed in room 3 with an open balcony that faced the beach. My husband and I had a wonderful stay.

But not unbearable. -Shower head was rusted and broke when we got there -Mosquitos (but this was everywhere.... bring repellant) -restaurant does not open until 8:15am, which means I had to seek out coffee else wear (next door) until they opened.    I would stay here again if I was on the same budget. "
"Many of the adverted features were not there. Not sure if scam or incompetent. Sheets had blood on them. Room not cleaned. Staff asked for deposits, then said they were actually rental fee when we asked for the deposit back (scam again?). The building seemed as if it could fall down any second and was heavily slanted. The showers did not work. Rooms were unsealed and mosquito nets were not provided."

"We made a reservation bye Booking for one night but when we arrived to the hotel we found it under construction.  They features shown in the Booking page were not available (no pool until June, they said).  When we try to cancel the people from the front desk and the Manager, don't know how to do it.  Finally we leave the property  with a very bad  experience."

There are no signs on the street, no directions given, and nobody knew where or what it was. We booked it through booking.com, which directed us to a place called Playa Selva through their map, so I thought maybe it was just one place with two names (that can happen in Mexico), but it wa"
Our stay at Casa Selva de luz was ok.  The location is right in the heart of tulum.  There are many beautiful shops and restaurants to visit all within walking distance.  the street is very quaint and beautiful.  The house itself is very clean.  We knew there wasn't air conditioning so that was not a shock but be prepared for the extreme humidity and heat.  We spent most of our time out exploring so it was not a big deal.  The backyard is cute and peaceful. The staff were very sweet and helpful.  The only t

Sunset Bungalows is completely misrepresented in there listing and photos.  The property is a dump located in a sketchy area.  The rooms are shabbily built with exterior doors that do not fit their frames allowing insects inside.  The bed linens were stained.  The windows also do not fit there framing.  The pool was unsanitary and cloudy.  We walked in and immediately turned around and demanded a refund and a taxi so we could relocate to a decent property in a safer location.

"You don’t get what you pay for at Vida Silvestre. Good idea but poor execution. Noisy neighbor, terrible water quality, unclean, just to name a few of the problems.   We were attracted to this property by its solar energy and other ecological appeals. Booked three nights though Booking.com and specifically requested quiet room away from loud music. Unfortunately it was impossible to stay beyond the first night due to noise.   When we first arrived, we noticed there was a construction site next to apartment "
" about it and planned to wait it out. By 11pm we realized it was not going to go away, texted the manager on WhatsApp. No response, no one on site to help us. Ended up the noise went on all night.   The next morning, tired and frustrated from lack of sleep, we requested to shorten the stay and get a refund for the remaining two nights. Manager claimed we were the first guest to complain about noise, which is not true as plenty other reviews said the same thing.   The management obviously knows about the pro"
"Looks great in the pictures.  The reality is awful! Black mouldy pillows, black mould everywhere! Dusty and dirty. The rooms smell disgusting,  like a mushroom growing room.  No hot water. Concrete dusty floors. My lungs couldn't take it as my asthma returned so we left. No refunds! They are miss selling this hotel on many platforms.  A fraudulent hotel. Avoid this place, its horrific!"

"We choose this hotel for the very convenient price, its location at one edge of the main avenue where all the bars and restaurants are, and for the spacious rooms. In a few minutes, you are in the centre of Tulum pueblo and everything is at walking distance. For things that are a little bit further, like beaches, you can rent a bike at the property for around 150 pesos/day. Our rate included a small and simple breakfast with toasts and jam, milk and cereals."
"The house was exactly like the photos and in a jungleish setting.  The house is partially thatched with nothing but screens for the downstairs portion.  We stayed in mid February which the temperatures are not that bad yet in Tulum, but I would consider somewhere else in the summer months, this place would be unbearably hot without AC.  The Tulum beach road has tons of foodie options available and we tried to hit as many of them as we could.  The only complaint I have of the area, not the house is the trash"
"It may have been wonderful at one time, but it is rundown. No resturant or bar. Eventually they did small breakfast. Noisy neighborhood. Not friendly. Pool dirty. Had to beg for towels, they didn't have wash cloths or hand towels. Bed hard as a rock. Throw pillows for the bed with a case on them??? What they listed as ammentities was mostly false. But a roof over your head, plumbing. Felt safe someone always  watching grounds."
"My upstairs room was clean, spacious and air-conditioned, and perfectly comfortable. I was in Tulum diving for a week, and I appreciated that there was plenty of space here to spread out my dive gear. The staff here is exceptionally friendly and pleasant, responding quickly to any requests. While the breakfast is a little skimpy, you are literally a couple of blocks away from places like Taqueria Honorio and Don Cafeto, or Ki'Bok if you need coffee. It's an excellent location near the main avenue, and I wou"

Rodriguez, the cheerful breakfast guy, went above and beyond to make sure his guests enjoyed the continental breakfast.

It was great having a room safe in which to store our passports and money. Sometimes we slept with earpl"
"We booked Vida Silvestre for our honeymoon last month, and unfortunately while there are some lovely aspects of the property, for us the trip was extremely disappointing, and would not be enough for us to recommend it to anyone.

In a panic, I let out my best horror movie scream and my husband ran into the bathroom yelling- flipped on the light turned out to be a rat. The next day we searched for it, and found feces in the villa, so it was potentially nesting in there. Ew. -bugs.

Upon arrival, we were told in quite an unfriendly way that we were a bit early for check-in, and it was going to be very crowded so he couldn’t help us now. Of course it was our own fault that we were early, so we waited patiently at the pool for a bit (could not get towels while we were waiting because we couldn’t find anyone who could help us), and at 3 PM the reception was still completely deserted.

Me and my friend where staying in January and it was so cold at night inside the bungalow that it ruined our sleep. We asked for extra blankets two days and not until our last night we got them after asking multiple times.  This made us tired during the daytime and I got a cold because of it.  If the walls are not good enough for the January weather they should have extra heating during the Mexican winter. Not have suffering guests.   It should be mentioned that the manager was so kind and helpful with othe

The rooms are basic but charming (sea shells for faucets) and very clean, with ""four poster"" beds equiped with good mosquito nets. It is a little walk into town and not all of the taxi drivers know where it is but the payoff for this is that it is very secluded and away from the noise of the traffic. Top tip; 2 gre"

"I'm very undecided about this place since they charge per person and not per tent. We stayed as 4 friends and were offered a tent of 4 for 350 pesos each. This tent was out of the breeze and basically in front of the 'car park' so we declined and were then offered a tent for 2, and 2 tents of 1 (3 in total). Two of us did not like the idea of staying alone since the vibe was not hotel but more a community of people who seemed to be living there long term, were not friendly and all the tents we were offered "
"I only stayed for one night so can’t comment too much on this hotel but I feel the other reviews are fair. The rooms are very basic, however it’s a very cheap hotel. It was quite noisy as there was work being done and the rooms are very close to the social areas. The food was very reasonably priced, but very average. I would say this is a good base if you don’t plan on spending too much time at your hotel, just sleeping."
"This place was just good. The bed and pillows were comfy and the room was huge with not much furnishing. It’s a good location to walk and grab some food or souvenirs. They offer bike rentals for about 250 pesos and that’s for the entire day. The food at the restaurant was okay, nothing to write home about. It’s a cool place to stay but I wouldn’t run back here."
"This hotel/apartment is really one of the nicest we've ever stayed at! Very clean, nice staff and beautiful outside area to relax at the pool. The kitchen was especially important to us and it didn't disappoint. It was big and had everything we needed.  Would definitely stay here again! :)"

We made the initial reservation through Booking.com and used their messaging technology to update the reservation as needed. However, the hotel "
" also weren't able to use any of Booking's other services that usual come with their reservation system.  We has THREE representatives from Booking.com along with ourselves calling non-working phone number the day before our arrival. Only ONE was able to locate the correct number after weeks of trying... that's when we got nervous.  Upon arrival we notice that most of the first floor is undergoing renovations along with a new development behind the hotel. Now, the construction behind the hotel wasn't the is"
"Very friendly and helpful hosts, great view of forest and very clean apartment and excellent price-quality!  A transportation means would be necessary to reach city center)  Thanks to Anotnieta and to Barbara for their great hospitality!"
This is a new hotel in Tulum. It's wonderful and the best part it's super quiet. I had no troubles of sleep because it's so calm and secure. I stayed for over 3 months at the place on a single apartment witch was really big and the balcony was cute and excelent to enjoy a coup of wine while I saw the sunset on the jungle. The pool was refreshing and on the third floor there's a roof top with a common area and a bbq. I totally recommend the place.

"My family of 5 stayed at Kaab Tulum(Dec. 28-Jan4).  The room was nice and clean, bedding was clean and comfortable. A/C kept us nice and cool. Safe in room. Staff were friendly and helpful when we needed help. Staff at the restaurant was very friendly and accommodating.  Loved the location. We rented bikes and rode down to the Tulum Beach area(better than taking a car or taxi). Walking distance to restaurants and tours.  Hotel arranged for our covid testing at our room(which was nice).  Would defintely stay"
"I spent an amazing 2 weeks at Valhalla Residence in the developing Tulum neighborhood of Riveria. The accommodations are clean, modern, and comfortable.  Staff are friendly, helpful, & knowledgeable about the local area. In-site access to bikes made it easy for me to quickly get to my favorite spots in town while spending every night in a quiet, relaxing location. A new to-go accommodation for me the next time I visit."
"My friend and I stayed at Kaab Tulum for 5 nights, and everything was perfect. The hotel pool area was very nice, the rooms were clean and well air conditioned, and the staff were helpful and kind. We really enjoyed swimming at pool. The location is great - we were able to walk to most places (grocery stores, restaurants, bars). A taxi ride to Tulum beach/the beach strip cost about $20 USD from here.    My only complaint was that we woke up very early to loud construction noises for multiple nights. There i"

"Travelled with my husband and we both loved our stay at Majaro. I found it through Instagram and the reality is just as amazing as all the pictures. The bed was really comfortable, the private pool was always clean. Loved the decor & amenities. The service was great. We will definitely stay again in our next visit."
"Perfect location, close to everything by bicycle, walking including the Tulum ruins, Caleta Tankah, Tulum Beach, supermarkets and more. The hotel feels intimate, welcoming and it has beautiful, clean, simple, pretty rooms and suites, I would have loved a coffee maker but that takes nothing away from the rooms, they are fab! I love the pool, so warm and we can relax and chill all day and night without feeling as if we are in a large chain-type hotel. The food is consistently delicious, all day and the breakf"
"Amazing experience, this is the real boutique experience I was looking for a relaxing trip with my husband. The hotel is quite and the staff is so dedicated we felt like family. The pool is so beautiful and the food is great!"
"We found this hotel on Airbnb and took a slight gamble as it didn’t have any reviews due to only recently opening. It exceeded all expectations and was the perfect place to stay whilst we were in Tulum… we’ve already re-booked for December! The design, staff, service and facilities were all amazing... It really felt like a luxury home away from home! A peaceful spa like vibe close to Tulum beach or Downtown (5-10 min taxi) or 10 min walk to La Veleta main strip with a few bars/ restaurants. We were made to "
"Sabrina from Italy who made everyday a special omellet for me, the receptionist from Argentina and the other staff at the hotel made our stay unforgetable.  Thank you for everything you did for me and my family. All the room Are Very clean and all the personal Are Very kind. I recommend this hotel."
"I stumbled across this new hotel and immediately was interested by the photos. I reached out directly and was in contact with Rene who I booked the Deluxe King with Plunge Pool room with. Rene helped me arrange efficient transportation from the airport to the hotel.   Upon arrival I was greeted by Rene, who was absolutely incredible and so helpful my entire stay. Rene informed me that I was the hotel's first official guest, which will always make me feel special!   After check in, Rene escorted me to my roo"
"Origen is a small Botique. It’s a no frills comfortable place to stay. There is air in the room during set evening to morning hours and there’s also a fan to use night/day. It’s in a wonderful location, walking distance to all. The staff are friendly and keep the room fresh with towels, drinking water and will give you suggestions when asked. It’s directly across from this hippie spot with great food, drinks and music called Taqueria La Eufemia. The only downside which didn’t bother me, the rooms do not hav"

Over 18 months on and with Mexico remaining almost exclusively on the red list from the UK, I was given an ultimatum by the hotel to use my credit before September 2021 with little warning and already a holiday booked elsewhere during this period.

"The stay in this hotel was very unpleasant.  First of all the location of the hotel. The hotel was extremely badly located, 25 minutes by car from all the beaches and about as long by bike as the hotel rents out to its guests.  Secondly, the water in the hotel is not drinkable. This is of course to be expected in Mexico but one would have thought that the hotel would provide drinking water to its guests which was not the case.  The hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar which forces the guests to go out "

Mike the owner will do backflips for you and is super well connected re reservations in the area.   The hotel  is a bit hard to find and is in central Tulum (about 20-30 minutes from the beaches and the ruins).     Look for a white building with a door made of wooden sticks.
 receiving in front of us a ticket of taxis. That's why I don't recommend this hotel.

Beautiful simple jungle room/huts around Tulum beach night life. Great rest after long days/night out. Amazing approach to your rooms. Quiet sleep and comfortable. I recommend this property one thousand percent. I will definitely stay here again.
"Another great stay at Origen Tulum. Camila at the front desk is an angel who always goes above and beyond for us. The room is always clean with plenty of new towels, the bed is comfortable, the room is spacious, currently the ac is only working in the evenings but that seems to be the case in alot of hotels on the strip since the storms, which was fine as we had a big fan to keep us cool. Check in and out is always quick and easy, and it's located directly across the street from the beach. I have already re"
"This place its so comfortable and peaceful, and it has a really good location, in the center of downtown closer to everything. And also the the hospitality its realy good, we felt like at home. We had a really good experience over ther with ghe best advices."
"The hotel seems nice at fast, until your belongings start disappearing one day after another... The staff went through our stuff and stole quite a lot of our belongings (laptop, cash, credit cards, sunglasses, perfume, etc...). They stole only the stuff that was hidden, but not was what evidently placed in the room, probably so it goes unnoticed for a bit longer. The hotel manager (who does not speak a word of english) is clearly in cahoots with the staff as well as with the police they ""called"" when we rep"
"The location of Origen was amazing. Across the road from the beach and close to shops, restaurants etc. However the room had a few issues. The shower was very salty water (which i think is an issue with a lot of the stays in the area). The drains had a bad smell most of the time. Our room didn't have a bug net so we did get bit a lot. The staff are very friendly and cleaned the room everyday with new towels. There was no breakfast included but the place next door did a good breakfast."
"I highly recommend Grand Balam Plaza. The location was perfect- easily walkable to all the shopping and restaurants in downtown Tulum. Plus, Tulum Beach was only a short drive (or bike ride away). Parking was easy and free.  Our apartment was cozy with everything you would need for a short stay- fridge, plenty of space to hang clothes, and a REALLY COMFORTABLE BED!  We also loved the lounges on both the 2nd floor and rooftop. Plus, 2 hot tubs. I mean, need I say more? The whole property relax felt very secl"
"My wife and I took a weekend trip to Tulum from Mexico City.  This place looked decent and they had a nice pool. All was well until we were about to leave and that is when my wife realized that some of her Jewelry was missing. The safe in the room was not working and my wife hid the Jewelry she did not use on our last day inside my suitcase. We have been noticing that our clothes in the suitcases were not the way we left them but we chalked it up to cleaning staff being extra nice. Little did we know, they "
"We loved it here. Beautiful boutique hotel that looks like an upscale treehouse. Wonderful decor, thatched roof, tropical, clean, great size, close to the beach, safe and great staff. Wifi and ac both worked fast and perfectly. We love Camilla the front desk/housekeeping Hostess. Super friendly, accommodating, let us have an early check in and a late check out as our flight was in the late afternoon. Directly across the street is taqueria La eufemia, our most favorite taco restaurant with full beach access "
We stayed here for my brothers 30th birthday and it was fantastic. The facilities were perfect. I recommend this if your in Tulum! great central location with luxury rooms and cleanliness! It has everything needed for a group
" police report. We also did not feel safe in the hotel given the fact that it is in the middle of nowhere and we feared for our safety if we brought up the issue. Although the jewelry was not expensive, it held a lot of sentimental value to my wife.   It is unfortunate how an otherwise decent hotel does not value with the basics of hospitality, namely security, in their establishment."
"The rooms were like pictured, if not better -- adorable small boutique hotel. Excellent location - 50m from the beach, literally across the street.  Beach access through tacos Eufemia, which has no minimum spend and doesn't charge for beach chairs (rare).  Excellent price for the hotel -- they're new, so I think they're building up their reputation and clientele.  And Carmelina (in charge during the day) is just the sweetest and most capable! She was handling everything the day I got there -- check-ins and "
"This hotel was absolutely gorgeous! I loved our stay here. The rooms are spacious and beautifully designed with a modern Mayan feel. There are two jacuzzis on the rooftop deck! I also really enjoyed the in-house massage, so professional and relaxing. Breakfast was very good as well. For the price it’s incredible."
"My boyfriend and I stayed here 2 nights, and we had a wonderful experience. Make sure when you are coming that you are in contact with Mike (owner) via WhatsApp prior to your arrival and you won’t have trouble finding the place. We were able to park right outside the hotel on the street every day with no problem. The bed is very comfortable and there is a fridge in the room. We had a little outdoor sitting area that felt pretty private with all the wonderful foliage. We both had 1 hour massages in the spa a"

"Strict with guests and pandemic regulations. Other than that, the building is in a great location and there is a nice rooftop.  There are helpful staff, who lined up a ride for us back to the airport. I would stay again when the pandemic is over."
"While this is a hotel, it also has a 4 bed dorm with an en-suite and private balcony.  I prefer dorms for their social atmosphere and was very pleased with this place.  A decent dorm in Tulum is a rarity, as most are basic party hostels.  Tulum is mainly known for its high-end beach resorts, while the town itself is a backpacker area with mainly nondescript tourist amenities.  The location is near the edge of the main town and convenient to the ADO bus station, etc.  The reception staff are very welcoming a"
" using a credit card at this hotel.  The amounts I was quoted were significantly different, and they clearly prefer cash.  This was my only dismay with my experience at this hotel.  The dorm was amazingly well appointed for a property that does not specialize in shared lodging.  The towel and toiletries were locked in my own storage locker, which was large enough for both my carry-on and backpack.  There is a well-appointed en-suite and large private balcony with chairs and table.  The wooden beds are solid"

"Great customer service from the very start!! Basic, but clean rooms. Location is perfect to explore the town on foot. I was very impressed with this place because they worked with me when we unexpectedly had to cut our vacation short by a few days. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a beach resort, but their location, customer service and price makes up for that. We would definitely return to La Palmita in the future."
"Very central to everything Tulum, we walked everywhere, and biked to the beach which is a 10-15 min bike ride. The rates at the hotel were great. With great wifi in the room. Rooms are very spacious.  We stayed in the suite which had a kitchenette with big fridge."
"Good location, close to restaurants, grocery stores, shops, banks, and a gym.  Alexandra and Richard, the owners, are friendly and engaging.  The room was large with high ceilings and a patio with chairs and a small table.  Guests can refill water bottles from the water dispenser in the hallways.  Major attractions are within walking distance.  I highly recommend this hotel."
"as title says, plus a very friendly and helpful personnel (we almost became friends with Alexandra) and next to the best breakfast in Tulum (el Cielo). Ideal for walking aroun every calle and have your night drinks (it's close to the best bars of Tulum)"
"Jose and Alexandra are extremely nice and helpful. If we returned late and needed towels or even tea, they are always helping with a smile. We had an almost unlimited supply of water, right next to our room. Alexandra even recommended a company for travel to chichen itza. The room had great facilities. A full kitchen and big fridge.  There's was no breakfast, even if we paid extra. Must take a cab to reach the beaches and Maya's ruins."
"Its been 18 years since we first visited Tulum. WOW, how things have changed. We come down every year or two and things have become quite the opposite of what we first relished in.

"We had a really pleasant 2-night-stay at Mimosa during a trip around Yucatan. The room (a cozy teepee which had a very unique vibe to it) and public areas were all clean and the staff was super helpful and acommodating throughout our time here.  An additional plus was a really cool pool party with a belgian DJ one night, which we also enjoyed a lot. I can only recommend the Mimosa to everyone who is looking for an easy-going atmosphere on their trip to Tulum!"
"Would recommend this place, as a couple with a 3 year old it was a good location on the beach at a reasonable priced compared to some of its neighbours.  The 'garden room with balcony' was spacious, two double beds, nice bathroom and aircon 8pm-8am which was fine for us as we were out on the beautiful beach or visiting local attractions. Had a balcony with two deck chairs and hammock chair but we hardly used them. Was cleaned very day you wanted.   The hotel is relatively small, so doesn't matter where you "
"By far one of the best hostels I’ve ever been !! The location is perfect, very close to the main street where you can find shops and restaurants and also take a bus to the beach. It is no problem for two european girls to walk home in the dark, we felt very safe. Spacious room with a very big shower. The whole hostel is in general really cute and clean. There is a nice pool and a very inviting bar.  But the cherry on top is definitely the staff, they were so friendly and helpful. They were always there to a"
Very friendly and helpful staff and a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The hostel is also well presented and extremely clean throughout. Conveniently located within 3 mins walking distance from the ADO bus station. I will definitely stay at this hostel again when I return to Tulum!
" egg and toast included + drink.  Plenty of restaurants, bars and shops in walking distance. There's a little collection of upmarket food trucks/cocktail bar just up the road called Tulum Munchies which was good to stop off for a drink on the way in or out. Next door Zebras beach bar was good, had lots of 'cool' spots to relax, massive range of cocktails and decent food. Also a small park for children.  The staff at Canek were excellent with us as a family, from the two lads who ran reception, the bar and f"

"Ariché is a very nice hotel in the center of Tulum. It’s very close to the Main Street with restaurants and the bus, also the ADO bus station is only 5 mins away. We spontaneously called them for a room and even expended our stay as we liked the hotel and Tulum so much. It’s a perfect mixed of hotel and hostel, where you can meet other people but also can stay comfortably in your own room. We booked the suite and had a tree inside our room, which was our highlight after the hostel dog. It was very clean and"

"Ariché is an ideal hostel for travelers working remotely or just looking for a relaxing place.  Everything is brand new, it's well-maintained, and the facilities are some of the best around.  There are three desks in the main area, and I hardly had any issues with the wifi except for in the dorms.  The owners Jeheil and Val are incredibly helpful and fun to hang out with.  They had some of the best recommendations in Mexico.  I loved the location because it's right in the middle of Tulum Centro near all the"
" They didn't serve food the last time I was there, but I know there were plans to start offering food.  The bathrooms are always clean, the showers come with shampoo and soap, and the dorms each have a light, plenty of outlets, and a locker big enough for at least a 55L backpack.  If you stay in any of the private rooms, you won't be disappointed.  They're some of the most beautiful I've stayed in.  Overall, Ariché is one of the best places I've stayed in Mexico.  I was there for about a month and a half."
"Stayed at the hotel for a little more than one week and I must admit I was surprised in a very positive way. The hotel looks nice, the size makes it more friendly, the staff is beyond professional and welcoming, the food is good and the location is perfect (no noise from party places, beautiful beach with sunbeds always available). I felt safe and appreciated. A great experience that I recommend strongly for people looking for a chill, clean & human-oriented mindset."

"We really enjoyed our stay at Ariche.  This youthful hotel/hostel is high on design and hospitality.  We also liked the cheap happy hour beers and free breakfast.  The well-traveled and multilingual Argentinian staff puts on uptempo dance music and that creates a party vibe in the breezy patio/bar area.  We rented bikes to explore the beach, which we ultimately decided was not for us (a little too South Beach).  We spent our time instead at cenotes (Jaguar, Grand Cenote, Sac Ac Tuan and Calavera are best) w"

Really enjoyable stay in the centre of Tulum half way to the beach and half way to downtown. The rooms are cosy and clean and you really feel like you are sleeping in the jungle. Showers always had hot water which was nice. The only thing was the hotel was really difficult to get hold of so I missed a night due to the check in time stating it was only until 20.30 but the reception advised me the next day that it is manned 24/7. I wish I had known this so I had not missed a night that I booked. Apart from th

"I had a truly wonderful stay at Ariche hostel. The staff is very friendly, and ready to help you out with any request. Very clean rooms and facilities. Low prices for delicious drinks and quality food. The only thing I regret is that I did not book a stay for longer, and unfortunately the hostel was already fully booked for the additional days I wanted to stay in Tulum. On a personal note, I got along very well with Jehiel, one of the owners. I hope our paths cross again at some point.   In sum, this place "
"I started with one week and extended my stay for over a month in the dorm. It's owned by a very sweet and kind Mexican couple who always tried to make me feel comfortable – way beyond ""good service"". No matter what I got to struggle with, they were there to support me and made me feel at home away for home. Ariché is located in the centre of Tulum but still very quiet for all of you who try to stay away from too many people, music and party. It has a beautiful swimming pool, enough spaces to work at and a h"

The guides were safe, gentle, people and seemed unphased by everything that happened during the ceremony, which helped me stay calm and comfortable too.

We booked this place because there were no other (budget) options left and we were glad we did! The room was basic but cheap and I think a very good price/quality. The location is perfect. What (easily) can be improved is that the toilet seat was broken and there was no hanger for the towels. Please fix these things and it is a really nice place to stay!
"The rooms are fine but you can find around with a good search  much better places in the same price! They only change towels every two days, whice is not comfortable when you go to the beach and take a lot of showers. They dont have hot water . And the lady there was nad because we put a towel on the flore because it was raining. I was too sick to move so i stayed there 3 nights but i do not reccomend."
"This spot is really interesting because I really like the look and feel of it from the outside. The fountain they have is so cool with the baby turtles. If you are looking to stay here, however, you must accept that it is very basic. This really is a place to sleep but I feel that it has so much potential. The beds are not so comfortable and there can be problem with it being loud at night. I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me as much. The staff are very friendly and helpful though.

"Worst hostel/hotel ever! (And I've been traveling for quite a long time..) The price you see on the internet is not what the woman at the desk will charge you (she adds more than 10%).  We were given a small room, the toilet was located right in the middle of it (which was especially appealing since the flush didn't work properly). There was fungus on all the walls and mattresses! The ac was a Little water fountain that damaged my books and made my clothes wet.  The room itself was wet as well, smelling lik"
" shouted at us, because apparently we left stains of sunscreen on towels. After apologizing we had to pay 15 US dollar for them.. old already dirty, see-trough towels..  the room is soooo noisy we could not sleep all night. Every thing is open, so it's not very safe either. anyway, just the worst stay ever.. not even the cheap price was worth it!  my advice: don't go there "

"We were booked to stay in this hotel on our visit here to isla mujeres- but when we arrived at the hotel to check in we found the room to be in terrible condition , dirty the bed was just hard as a rock and a baby of one of the workers was in a playpen screaming and unattended-was like a sound vortex  in the center going through my brain like a hammer. For this same money maybe a few dollars more you can find a nice Airbnb which is what I wound up doing after canceling this reservation.  To be fair it is no"
"La atención de la gerente es muy buena, las habitaciones muy bien decoradas y todo esta nuevo y funciona a la perfección, el precio bastante accesible y esta ubicado en una zona donde ya no se escucha ruido en la calle. EL único pero si es que pudiera ser, es que el baño no tiene puerta y si es algo incomodo sobre todo si no vas en plan de pareja. Pero fuera de eso hay solución y nos la pasamos de lo mas rico. Felicidades y que lo sigan conservando asi de limpio y arreglado."
"We booked this hotel through Expedia and when we found it, it was still under construction and definitely not ready to be booked. We walked in the lobby was still being worked on. The receptionist greeted us at a card table under the stairs. We asked her if the construction was going to stop and she yes in 20 minutes. We were very tired and once the room was ready we were looking forward to taking a nap. The room itself was nice except that there was no door on the bathroom. The toilet was open to the room."
 and the construction crew there. We ended up leaving and Expedia refunded us but we had to find a different hotel.   I think it was unethical of this hotel to rent out rooms before they were ready to open and I wouldn't stay here again because of this.
We stayed one night at Lolos as a gracious gesture through facebook.My husband and I were celebrating our 30 th Wedding Aniversary this our 9th trip to Isla.The property is unlike any place we have stayed.Lolo has designed and participated in creating this unique artful abode.The room we stayed in is off the courtyard.Its a delightful mix of sculpture and color.Lolo is a wonderful hostess and her housekeeper is lovely .
"I had to cancel my trip due to the unprecedented circumstances in the UK and Europe (corona virus). Although it was pass the ‘free cancellation’ date, this hotel kindly agreed to waive the fee and allowed me to cancel the booking for free. It was really kind and understanding of them. If I go to Tulum in the future, I will definitely book this hotel again. Thank you, Casa Abanico!"
"Everything is perfect. The staff is kind, the room is super clean, beautiful and comfy. There is a shared space to make your own meal or have a coffee with a view on the beautiful garden. It is a little paradise really close to everything."
Had a problem w a 3rd party website and the owners were kind enough to accommodate me.  This place is like a small apartment complex. Well maintained and quiet.  It’s towards the end of the Main Street/strip and less than 10 min walk from the ADO bus station which I recommend using for travel between large cities.
"We stayed 3 nights at Casa Abianco and loved every minute. The owners make you feel really comfortable and their beautiful dog Mango is always ready for a pat.   Short walk to the main street where  the best Burrito place is right at your doorstop (Burrito Amor)   Cenotes very close by as well and there are bikes to rent (free of charge).   They have free drinking water to refill your bottle with as well, so no need to keep buying water.   So much detail has gone into this place. We loved it."
"What a beautiful place. The owner was lovely and very generous to wait up late for me when I ended up getting hung up at customs because of cigars. LOL. I was almost heartbroken when I checked in not because it was bad, but because the ground were just so lovely and the room was lovely, and the bed was comfortable and the kitchen/common area was great and I was only staying one night! I seriously considered changing my plans so I could stay longer. My car was parked on the street and was fine through the ni"
" a critique, more just a heads up."
…
"The guest house is located a few blocks off the west end off the main drag, it is only a ten minute walk to restaurants and shops. The owners are super friendly and very helpful. My room was spotless and the bed was very comfy. I highly recommend stay here and if I am ever in Tulum again I will definitely stay here."
"This place was much more than I expected. But, I happened to need to work on my laptop a bit at night during my 4 night stay. They advertised free Wifi in the rooms online, and had signs at the hotel stating the sam. However, I was only able to get wifi twice for about 5 mins each. There was a solution to this though. Apparently the kitchen area that is on the second floor (and also a pretty cool setup!) has a decent Wifi signal there compared to the room I was in. This wasn't a major problem because I only"
 avenue. I would stay again!
"Just AVOID this place.  Our room was nr. 1, right besides the reception, you could hear every word spoken and loud music coming from across the street till late night ours.  Room had a terrible smell, which never went away, there was only fan, no AC, window was facing to some disturbing inside view(see picture) and one of the window glasses was missing, had to close it with plastic to avoid some cockroaches coming in, other window was facing the hallway where everyone was passing by and again you could hear"
"Awful place. The floor was so dirty it turned our feet black walking around. The room windows only face to other inside areas so there was no ventilation. It was really damp, moldy and there was even a dirty lime slice in the room when we arrived. The staff who worked there were ok but the owner has anger problems and screamed at us and kicked us out early with no warning because we made a complaint."
So we booked the hotel expecting a comfortable stay in Tulum. However the moment we check in we did declare we were checking in earlier then they got confused. Another thing the room looked like run down dorms old facility and gosh the noise is unbelievable. We did our booking via booking.com for 6 nights we left the same night as we could not take the quality. The towels were run down and the shower pressure was too low. We asked for a refund and still have not recieved it its been over a week or so. I wou
"Please avoid this hotel at all costs, I couldn’t travel due to COVID restrictions but they not only kept my money but also double charged my stay Also their customer service is pure useless Avoid at all costs                   "
"Located right next to the ADO bus station this small hotel is easy to get to and easy to bus out from. Colectivos were also easily accessible only steps away from the lobby. The main entrance area and waiting lobby is nice. They had bikes to rent but they were all out of use and needed “repaired”. The rooms are very small. The first room we were in the AC unit didn’t work so they moved us to another room where it did (which we were very happy for). However the sink in the bathroom leaked, and followed the g"

"We stayed 3 nights in two different rooms. Many rooms had no windows and therefore bad indpode climate, as their couldnt get fresh air in the rooms. Some of the rooms dont have hot water. They match prises, and we got a room with air con for 600 pesos. Good value for the money. "
"We stayed two nights here and it was great. Having the pool was fantastic, especially as the beach has lots of seaweed. Great rooftop area as well. Room had a fridge but will need only cutlery etc if want to byo own food. Very central but quiet when inside. Felt very safe. Terrific staff highly recommend."
Had a lovely time here the place is quite small with a lovely roof area which we enjoyed with a couple of margaritas. The owner was lovely. The pool was good after a day at the beach very close to town bus stop and taxis 
"Although my wife and I only spent one night at the Casa Sofia, we would definitely book more nights on a return trip to Tulum.  The hotel was clean and the staff was both friendly and helpful.  The Casa Sofia is located just a few blocks from the bus station, which we used to travel to Valladolid.  The hotel is also a short walk to many restaurants. We arrived in Tulum in the late afternoon.  After we checked in, we walked to the Don Cafeto restaurant for supper and we enjoyed the food and service  enough t"
 our bus departed.  The manager was very kind and allowed us to store our luggage so we would be free to explore Tulum before we left.  The Hotel Casa Sofia met our needs and we hope to return someday.
…
This accommodation is right in the centre and the perfect hideaway. It is the best value for the price. The rooms were spacious and clean the beds comfy and a little pool in the centre to cool down after a day of exploring. You will not get better for the money. Lovely traditional decor. If your looking for a reasonable priced hotel close to the centre do not look any further. The added bonus is the manager who is very nice and informative about the area. We didn't have breakfast so can't comment. 
"The view from outside certainly does not do this little gem justice!  It is in a great location just a short walk from the main street in Tulum so is easy to get to all the bars restaurants and shops; the rooms are a good size with a/c good showers and there is the bonus of a very nice small private pool. The staff are very helpful and charming, this is a great place to stay and at a fantastic price, highly recommended by me!"
"The staff are amazing, the location is perfect! The rooms are great with air condition and good size bathroom.  Great rates and well worth the money for the location and walking distance from the main strip of Tulum's city centre.   Book it, short and sweet!"
"Good value hotel - rooms approx 150$cad per night. Walking distance to tons of great resto’s in town. A bit of a distance to the beach though - need car or taxi.  Super friendly staff. Simple breakfast (toast, yogurt, waffles) included w coffee and tea. Well kept and clean hotel. "
I’m glad to report that Casa Sofia is still as fine a place to stay in Tulum as a year ago. My wife and I stayed at this charming small hotel on the way from Cancun to Xcalak for one night. Angel greeted us at the front door and got our luggage to our room promptly. The air conditioning worked very well and we were comfortable at all times. The breakfast was limited but very nice near the small pool and got us ready for the drive ahead.   This year Casa Sofia had added a locked parking lot just a minute’s w
"Clean. Staff.location.environment.culture.price  5+star! I barely leave reviews , but I took my time for this one. Exceptional customer service, sparkling clean, location is 5 min from beach, friendly environment, great food next to it (Palo santo) definitely recommend. Thank you Lupita & Enrique !!"
"Super friendly and welcoming staff. Excellently convenient with the lending bicycles, free of charge - best way to get around Tulum. Located across from a huge supermarket. The overall experience was good, but with a few buts. The room was spacious and modern, but I missed basic amenities such as a dedicated nightlight, a hairdryer and a fridge. The decor was modern, but the naked lightbulbs hang in the height of my eyes, and I had to unscrew the bulbs to not be blinded all the time. The flooring is some so"
"We‘ve stayed there two nights for about 1000 pesos - the room is very big, with two chairs, two tables, a fan, airco and a TV (though we didn’t use it).  The hosts are very friendly, they gave us plenty of tips about the Ruins, the beach, the cenotes and bike rentals!  The private bathroom includes a shower with hot water, but there’s really just 5 drops per minute coming of the shower head (also with cold water).. there‘s no toilet seat either, and it smells a bit muffy in the bathroom .. but they have han"
We have just spent the last 4 nights at Posada 77 and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Liliana was so kind and welcoming and we were worried because our Spanish isn't very good but her English is perfect. She showed us pictures of all her favourite Cenotes and told us how to get there. The room was big and clean and it's situated a 5 minute walk from the supermarket and restaurants but it's quiet at night so you will get a good nights sleep. Thank you so much Liliana for making our stay so
love Mexico so much even tho I was poorly the views are amazing the beach is so warm it's like paradise just dont go in summer because it gets so hot I I highly recommend British people go in our winter time
"If you're looking to be immersed in Tulums jungle environment, this is the place. You're staying in the jungle with limited access to power, internet, and AC. The property is behind an awesome restaurant, set back far enough from the party strip to not hear the noise. The rooms are basic with no bells and whistles. A place to sleep and shower.  Mosquitos abound, so be prepared. Mosquito nets and screens are provided, but you'll want bugspray for the day and citronella for the night.   If you're looking for "
"The restaurant staff is super rude. A big fat no, avoid with all cost. Food was so so but pretty expensive but obviously you don't enjoy it at all if the staff members are acting like kids. With no reason. Horrible. Just go somewhere else in Hotel Zone"
"This place is magical. I’m truly in love. The temazcal ceremony is the best part. So much healing, amazing energy here. The staff is genuinely sweet & welcoming. Food & drinks are refreshing & clean. Everything about this place is tulum. The ocean is 50 steps away from the rooms, you can’t get any better than this. If you want the full tulum experience I highly recommend Tunich."
Not  a safe place . The items are stolen from the room. So i will certainly not encourage anyone to stay at such a crime location. I also heard similar issues from other neighbours staying at the same place
"What we liked about the Tunich is the location. Just on the other side of the road of a free beach cove access. The food is delicous and the service was very friendly. Isma and Gio attended us kindly although we arrived at a high peak service hour.    There is a bike rental just across the road and it is a short ride to town and the ruins.   The price is a bit too steep for the room value and of course there is the street noise, but that seems to be Tulum."
"Great staff, wonderful atmosphere. Taking food to go across the street to the beach would be ideal for a beach picnic. (Maybe 100 steps away) Their long bar style table out front near the busy road is the perfect place to enjoy an iced coffee and people watch. We had bagels but they have lots of other items available that looked pretty good too.  Also, the board games and UNO were a nice touch while waiting for breakfast or afterwards while you finish your coffee. Thanks Gio! Definitely recommend Tunich."
"When i asked the manager if they allow pets, they replied to me: “EXCUSE ME” (yes with capital letters) we don’t take pets, next day I saw another guest staying at the hotel with a chihuahua dog!! I don’t get it! why they said yes to her and not to me? They didn’t care what kind of dog, size, bread."
"Tunich was such a beautiful place! My stay there was perfect, I cannot wait to return! The rooms were great the bed was comfortable, the food was so good. The complimentary breakfast was a great start to our day. Beach access is only a few feet away to a quiet little beach area. I participated in the temazcal ceremony and that was a wonderful experience!  Blaine and his staff are absolutely amazing."
"I recently stayed at this property for a 7 night stay. There are so many great things to say about this hotel!! The room was spotless, with everything I needed for my stay including cold bottled water, a small fridge, bath products, cozy towels and linens. The room had AC which is a game changer for sleeping at night.   The hotel staff is INCREDIBLE! Super friendly, helpful, kind, and knowledgable about all things Tulum. You can rent a reliable bike to get around town. The pool is super clean and they have "
" places to eat within walking distance.   I highly recommend and would 1,000% stay here again!"
"If your looking for a place to do temazcal or Bufo medicine ceremony, I wouldn’t look further. I am so grateful for meeting this amazing shaman Isaac  and  the owner of the hotel Blane. It was my first ceremony and couldn’t ask better people to be there for it. They make you feel safe and you really feel taken care of. I had  a beautiful private ceremony right on the beach during sunrise. No words to describe it really! definitely going back when next time in Tulum.   Btw their breakfast is delicious too wi"
…
"We had a short but very pleasant stay, thanks to the amazing staff. Our room was perfect. Big, bright and clean. The breakfast was delicious. Parking was very convenient. Highly recommend staying at this place!"
"We had a great time. The host and all the staff made us feel like home. Perfect breakfast, amazing cocktails and the muffins are the one thing that you can not miss. The sea is just across the street and if you can enjoy the sun rising."
"This property has been my favorite of the 3 I have stayed in Tulum. It is tucked away in the quiet, yet up and coming neighborhood, La Veleta. It's about a 15-20 min walk to the main street and much quicker on a bike/scooter. The property only has 6 units which I loved and the stay comes with complimentary breakfast (eggs, juice, fruit, coffee, etc.) The property has nice big rooms, a lovely balcony to do work, clean bathrooms, and a nice big rainfall shower.   I liked this property because I didn't want to"
"If you are looking for an incredible spiritual journey while in Tulum, I highly recommend Tunich's Temazcal.   I have done this practice at other places in Tulum and they did not compete with my experience here. Not only was it the most authentic practice I have had but it also was a fraction of the cost of other places in Tulum.   An authentic, shaman lead ceremony worth exploring!! Give it a try!!"
" Overall, I would highly recommend this property for guests who want to have their own quiet space, but still be relatively close to all the action."
"A dream come true! Phenomenal health food restaurant with breakfast included in the stay. Natural jungle setting. Affordable accommodations across the street from the beach, whereas other lodging in the area is much more highly priced. What great value - what a treat!"
…
"Together with my children, age 13 and 11, we spent here one wonderful week and of december. very comfortable and clean room, bike service to move everywhere around, but most of all excellent and kind service, with a personal touch that makes you feel like home. breakfast is delicious, and moreover as an italian you can have a top espresso every morning! swimming in the pool in the evening gives that refreshing power you need to restart! the owners are nice and easy going as well, flexibility and kindness ar"
Staff were very nice and helpful. Rooms and bathrooms were clean. Bikes were available for free which we used everyday to ride into the town. We really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back again.
"Beautiful little slice of land in the jungle. Very simple and clean cabanas, great bathroom block, large showers. Only problem was the mosquitoes which found there way past the net (it was abit difficult for me anyway, to keep the net all the way around the bed). Also could improve the breakfast, only toast and coffee. Kitchen and bikes free for guest use was great!! Clean pool and great bird watching around the property."
"So friendly, great value.  Clean.  Quiet location. Free bikes if you leave an ID.   The only thing to improve would be free breakfast which is just toast, jam, coffee.  There were not many people around - no social scene.  "
"This was the most spectacular place!! The accommodations here are 5 star all the way!! We love the way the nature is a part of the architecture   Love this entire complex, the pools, the gym, security, location. perfectly in-between the beach and the town   There is a WOW factor when yo come into the complex, it’s priceless."
"Pros: big clean rooms Clean bathrooms with hot water Pool is lovely Breakfast was simple but we really enjoyed it  Bed was super comfy Free bikes!  Staff were super friendly and helpful  Cons: A little far from the beach and a bit far from town Its a tent/yurt so you can hear outside very clearly  Overall a really excellent quiet spot in nature, would highly recommend."
"STAY AWAY!!!  Stayed at the Mistiq Tulum apartment complex with my husband from March 25-28th. Nice place aside from getting robbed at gun point the morning of our departure to cancun on the 28th. There were four of us having breakfast at around 10AM at La Baguette Bistro on the outside terrace, this is part of the complex front side. We had all sat down, but hubby had to go talk to front desk regarding a friend’s EarPods that were left behind. He came back and sat down with us, about 5-8 min later a Mexica"
"The room we stayed at was adequate, nothing special, but the whole area of Joy Tulum is very nice! The pool area is great to relax at in the heat. It is also pretty close to the center of town; just a 5 min cycle. And they give bikes for free! "
We came late at night from the airport. The hotel did a very nice job to arrange a taxi for us since we didn't knew if we where able to go by bus.   The check in was very fast and secure. The front desk staff was very polite and welcoming.   It was so cold when we arrived so we asked for extra blanket and we got it. There was no problem in that.   The bed and pillows where comfy. Yet the room was very simple we had everything we needed. It was big for our luggage. We experienced a rain shower and the bungal
" didn’t even call the police. The Mistiq manager and the unit manager (Hector & Carolina) came out and asked what happened, we told them and they  asked what kind of watch? When we told them it was a Rolex, they said “is a very common thing lately”  WOW  “its a common thing lately”!!?? You would think they would at least warn us or even post it at the Airbnb, guess business is more important than customers safety for them!  This was definitely an inside job, they all work together I wouldn’t TRUST anyone th"
" morning.   The breakfast is simple and nothing more. I would recommend eating somewhere else because you don't get ""full"" since its only toast, jam and cheese.   You get free bikes for rent. YOU NEED A BIKE to get to town. You can always walk but its a little far away from the beach and restaurants. But since you are away from town the area is quiet and nice.   Staff always there to give you tips.   Things to improve: breakfast and wifi."
…
They will rent you an apartment and you will show up and its not available. Happened to me and my friends and apparently is a consistent problem. Dont yourself a favor and dont rent there. No support but a shrug and some excuse that the reservation system is not working.
…
IF I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE A ZERO I WOULD. Stay LITERALLY  anywhere else….  During our stay while we were asleep someone from the hotel broke into our unit and stole our belongings. We have proof of when they came into our unit. The code was never changed and no help was ever given. We literally had to sleep with a chair in front of our door the rest of the time so we would hear it if it opened…. The security team is in on it 100% as well as the rest of the hotel. They never provided security camera footage
"This place looks nice, however there’s no management whatsoever. During the weekend our unit was attacked, our door broken  by a gang, we were beaten (I suffered severe trauma in the head needing scalp stitches and an MRI), we were kicked, held at gun point and all our stuff stolen (over $15k of possessions and electronics). Police says the internal security was involved. Management originally promised to take care of the problem and provide reparations after the robbery. Days later they claimed it was not "
"Joy Tulum was a wonderful experience. The rooms are basic (although you are camping!) but theres enough space for everything you need.   The bathrooms are shared, however they are SUPER clean, and we never had to wait for the bathroom or shower.   The pool area is wonderful for a morning relaxation if you want the sun, or a perfect way to cool down in the shade in the afternoon.   The free bikes are necessary and the best way to get around as the location is a little bit out of the way from the main downtow"

"Situated directly on the beach and next to the archeological preserve this is a great escape.   Very few amenities included; exterior shower, no AC, not even a hair dryer.  This views are beautiful.   My bungalow was very tight for one with an average and one small piece of luggage."
"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The beachfront location is incredible and the grounds are so lovely, almost dream-like. Staff is also very friendly and accommodating and room rates are a great value for such a premium location.  Note that accommodations are very rustic, so don’t expect the amenities of a typical beach resort or chain hotel, but in my book that only added to the charm."
This hotel was good for the price! The construction nearby wasn’t as loud or noticeable as we thought it would be. I deducted a star because I thought the customer service at the front desk could have been better. Our favorite part of the stay was the rooftop bar and pool. The bartender Julio was awesome. He made the best drinks and was so fun to talk to. We will be back!
"We had been looking forward to this hotel where we had booked for 6 nights. The pictures on all booking sites lie and that's not what you get. We find a another hotel after the first night at Posada 06, and without the opportunity to get the money back for the remaining nights. This is not a hotel, but a 1 star hostel."
"Located in the national park which is a beautiful area in Tulum but quite far from Tulum life (need to get a taxi which is gonna ask you crazy money for the ride because you’re a tourist)  Accommodations could offer more! No furniture at all in the room (no closet, no mirror, one very small and not shiny light only, no iron, no air dryer, no freezer, no AC - pretexting it’s for the ecology).  Forget the wifi (there is but the signal is zero).  The beach is beautiful tho, nice sunbeds, nice service from the "
Playa Esperanza is the perfect place to stay on the beach of Tulum for a chill and laid back experience. You can hear the waves when you sleep and wake up with the sunrise :) The food was delicious as well!
"The staff was phenomenal. So helpful and kind. They were super responsive. They were great and accommodating. Helped in so many different ways. This is more to do with other aspects.  While I understand being able to hear street noises, we were treated to a full rock concert right under our room, on a Sunday night. Amplifier and all. Went on for 3+ hours. Absolutely horrible. The band was good, just entirely inappropriate. Even if it were at the restaurant next door- not sure if it is a part of the hotel. T"
"This review is not about my stay but about the hotel management, specifically the owners wife Sharon who is also the reservation manager.  I don't know how the hotel is to stay because we were nearly ripped off at check in - see invoice attached.  The agreed upon total was supposed to be for 5 nights split between their 2 hotels, other El Nido, Holbox.  Since we asked to swap 2 nights in Tulum due to weather the owners request we pay an additional $150 for the nights in Tulum and as agreed upon in writing f"
This was one of my favorite places in all of Mexico. The rooms are right by the beach and there is an outdoor shower. The food is really great and there's also a bar. The staff was super friendly and helped with all our queries. Would highly recommend staying here.
" be up and trying to sleep with a concert less than 100 feet from your patio.   Ear plugs I ran out to buy didn’t even being to cover it. I did cry, it was so stressful.   The wifi in our room went out but thankfully I could piggy back on to another room. NBD and no wash cloths, so we were told to buy our own.  But if you’re not okay risking your sleep for a possible concert, I would pass. I thought it would end at 10, but no. They kept going.   I sobbed. I am so tired as I write this, they will not stop.

" email agreement the front desk rep called Sharon and she told him ""just charge them that"".  When we asked them to handwrite on the agreement that is was for 5 nights to clarify he said ""we can't do that""    We ultimately had to walk as by paying and signing that invoice it would have given them the legal right to charge us over $1k for 2 nights, plus the original amount of almost $900 USD.  Totally incorrect and we want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but on paper this is as it appears - unethical. "
We came to playa Parisco and stopped in for the day.  500 min pesos and you can use their chairs for free.  Best chicken burrito we have had since we got to Mexico.  Great service and great place to hang for the day at the beach.

Came for the day with beach friends only one server and food took a long time and was served cold stick with cold dishes  Servicio added to bill so no need for extra tips  The beach is amazing drinks good not too expensive don’t know that we return 
I loved this hotel. Just stayed 2 days but could have stayed longer. Celine at the reception is a very kind and helpful person. I recommend this hotel. In front of the hotel is a supermarket and near are  lot of great places to take a drink.  Go book this hotel right now if you want to stay in tulum.
"I found myself with some extra time in Mexico before returning to the US, in light of the CV thing, and I came across this little gem in looking around Tulum one morning. An oasis to come back to at the end of the day, very simple, but stylish, and in a perfect location; just on the edge of all the hubbub. Only one complaint, and it is minor, is that they could try and soften up the towels. The staff were all great too, in particular Walter, who provided some great advice on places to go and things to do. I"
"We booked 3 rooms in this hotel for May 2019. When we arrived, it was very different than the pictures. The rooms are super dark and small, the mosquito nets of the beds and the windows have many holes, hence there are many insects inside. There was an iguana in our room so they changed the room. We could not sleep because of the noise as there are no proper windows. The showers are too dark that we needed to put candles and flashes of phones around to shower. The beach had crazy amount of seaweeds so we co"

 were for the facilities which were awful or we could not use. In addition the owner had parties on the weekend which kept us awake until they were done as there are no proper rooms or windows for noise cancelling..
Had an amazing stay at hotel blanco. The rooms were very clean and beautiful. Our receptionis Connie was super helpfull and gave us a lot of advice! Location was amazing. Would recommend this to anyone!
"We thoroughly enjoyed our 9 nights at Hotel Posada. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the street and enjoyed the privacy and view that it gave us. Our daily breakfast included coffee, fresh fruit (and juice), yogurt and typically some type of eggs. After exploring Tulum and seeing other hotel options we were very glad to have booked our stay here. The staff was very helpful and friendly and our room was always spotless upon our return from exploring. The pool was much better than we anticipated (base"

The internet photos do not reflect the true nature of this hotel  1) pool filthy on the edges and cloudy water  2) complete ignorance when asking for extra beach towels and bathroom towels - the girl on reception was stubborn and then downright rude  3) construction site going on right next to the hotel  The noise in the morning started from 7 am !!!! 4) tried to change rooms but the staff kept saying no availability for more than one night - that’s highly doubtful as the room I changed into had no one stay
 block from the Main Street in Tulum and a short walk to some of the best taco places around. The beach road and grocery stores are all close as well. We were able to rent bikes from the hotel daily and get where we needed to go. It can be hard to find bike rentals after the early morning so this saved us a lot of hassle.   We would definitely recommend staying here if you come to Tulum. All the good (affordable) food is in the town and the beach is a moderate bike ride away. If you can get room 15 it’s fan
 sargassum seaweed ( never saw any indication of this seaweed problem in tulum or any of the coast for that matter   Overall I would not recommend this hotel  My advice go to Holbox island - it was crystal clear water and amazing !!!

"Hotel Posada 06 in Tulum is perfectly located just one block from the main part of town. 24/7 security makes it safe also.  The staff couldn’t have been friendlier here and extremely helpful to a Mexican novice like myself ... Julio and Walter were simply amazingly happy and helpful hosts.  The breakfast staff were lovely with an ample a la carte breakfast of eggs, salads, toast and cake along with coffee and juice.  Upon arrival I was disappointed with the economy room facing the main road. It was extremel"
We were very pleased with our experience at El Paraiso! Every person we encountered was extremely accommodating. They gave us great recommendations for activities and food and even provided bikes and a bike lock for us to get to some of these places.  We mainly communicated via WhatsApp and everyone was really responsive. Oh and did I mention the free breakfast they provide every day? A nice little touch 😄. I would certainly stay here again should I return to Tulum!
"This review is overdue. I stayed at El Paraiso Hotel with 2 girlfriends in December over the holidays. We found the property on Tripadvisor and from the reviews/their social media it looked decent. We really cared about staying on the beach for easy access during the day. There's a ton I wish we knew prior to visiting Tulum so I'm happy to share here.   Our stay at El Paraiso Hotel was 5 nights long. In total we paid $3,295 ($659/night). For a room with 2 double beds, this was on the higher end of our budge"
"Casa Teka was above and beyond our expectations. The level of service was phenomenal and the location was ideal, we would highly recommend and will definitely be returning.   It was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and on arrival, they had beautifully decorated the room which was really thoughtful and unexpected. The room was spacious, comfortable and the bathroom/shower was luxurious. Every morning we went down to the cenote to have a delicious breakfast and a swim (the staff at the restaurant were really love"
" the set-up. It wasn't luxurious or relaxing and was loud. Also, we weren't allowed to have more than one beach bed per a room, however, we were 3 guests and only 2 people fit on a bed. This was disappointing and of course not relaxing for all. We also ordered lunch and the food was not great at all. After this beach day, we decided this beach club/experience was not at all what we were looking for and made beach club reservations at other places for the rest of our stay.   A few days into our stay, a famil"
" enough about this place, we fell in love with it but the thing that stood out the most was the service, everyone was SO friendly, welcoming and helpful. We felt genuinely sad leaving!   We'll be back but definitely go if you can!!"

"Gran opción a excelente precio  Me hospedé en este hotel del 20 al 23 de abril y me pareció excelente opción. Su personal es muy amable y acomedido; sus instalaciones magnificas, los cuartos amplios, iluminados y limpios. Su vegetación es espectacular. Muy buen restaurante.  Espacios muy cómodos para descansar, leer, escribir y otras actividades.   Definitivamente mi experiencia fue magnifica y quiero ya regresar en cuanto pueda. Lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"I visited this hostel on july 2021, and it was an incredible experience, the party, the staff, cleanning, everything was amazing. Good prices, good location. I wanna go back again. Im really thankful for this incredible experience."

"We loved our stay! From the sweet receptionists that were so helpful and knowledgeable, to the 24hr security, we felt completely comfortable and happy with our stay.  The room was fantastic with working A/C, daily room cleaning, and big comfy beds.  Not to mention that the beach was perfect! Thanks El Paraiso!"
"We were the very FIRST guests to stay at this lovely hotel. While construction was still happening on the building, the staff was super helpful and kind. They helped us get to the supermarket (our room had 2 bedrooms and a full kitchen!), rent bikes, and even book an excursion. The food in Tulum was AMAZING, but the free breakfast at the hotel was one of the highlights. The kitchen staff definitely know what they're doing. We highly suggest staying here. It's between the beach and downtown, plus has all the"
"Absolute worst Hostel experience of my life. Do not stay here! I was assaulted by another hostel guest who sucker punched me and ended up knocking my two front teeth inwards. It was a completely unprovoked attack.   The “experience” staff Yazmin and Romina completely failed to follow any proper protocol. They didn’t call the police. They didn’t call me emergency medical care. Instead, they left me to bleed all night by myself until I could figure out where to get emergency medical and dental services the ne"
"We discovered CasaTeka restaurant while shopping.. Michel (hotel/restaurant manager) and Israel (host, waiter, bartender, number one worker)  Served us outstanding food  and best Margarita  and their private cenote which is a hidden gem... If I had known about this boutique hotel this is where we would have stayed as they not only have their own private cenote but you can have access to a beach front with  their partner  on the beach side"
We’ve come to El Paraiso Tulum on two separate occasions and both were amazing experiences. The staff is very attentive and makes sure you are very comfortable. They are very good with setting up taxi’s for guests. The beach club is a mere 80 second walk from the guest rooms and they have great food… though the drinks could be a bit stronger. The rooms are quaint but very nice. The best part was the daily breakfast and uncanny customer service (WhatsApp friendly). All in all an incredible property with amaz

Completely ignoring me and shunning me until I checked out on November 3rd. I had to get a emergency flight back home.

Michael Romero the manager was at the front desk and gave us the warmest welcome ever ! Casa Teka is a hidden gem jungle side with luxurious and huge rooms ! All rooms are like a little individual houses ,so you have your privacy too! The bathrooms had 2 sinks and big mirrors, the bed was super comfortable, they cleaned and changed our sheets every day "
"The rooms were so beautiful and clean, free bike rentals, COVID safe breakfast brought to us every am, and great location. Most people in Tulum stay on the main beach road. I don't recommend this because it's packed and the hotels are outrageous. Paraiso Hotel was perfectly located on the beach and hotel guests had free access to the amazing beach club."
"Had an amazing stay at this wonderful hotel! The decor of the rooms are so grounded and makes you relax, its like you see in the photos and even better. Moreover, the outer facilities of the hotel is also so well established and amazing for taking photos.  The staff was super friendly and a special thanks to Edi and Max at the reception who helped with outstanding customer service."

"It is a beautiful hotel in a stunning location  Unfortunately, the rest of the hotel does not live up to expectations.   For this price bracket, you would typically expect a free breakfast etc. However, you are made to pay over the odds for everything. Another example of this is bike rental. You are forced to pay 300 mxp for a day which is far more than what you would pay for the same bikes if you were to rent them in Tulum town. This is the kind of thing that a hotel of this calibre should be allowing gues"

" due to 'mexico' however, we did not experience this type of service anywhere else so found this to be a very flippant suggestion. This comment wouldn't have stung as much if the price of the hotel reflected 'mexico'. Additionally, hotel staff don't seem to have any useful recommendations on what we should be doing from day to day and just google everything you ask them.   Overall, I expected pure luxury and quality. The sole thing that lived up to this was the room itself and nothing else sadly. This hotel"
"Pool is nice. Breakfast had decent varieties. The excursion options were good, although Easy Tours who they go through are not that easy.   We would get our bathroom cleaned like twice a day. It was a clean room and great to have the shades on them."
"HONEST WARNING: do not book! There was no running water and no electricity, and the manager refused to issue a refund. The hotel is adjacent to a busy construction site, as well as a nightclub, so there is constant noise day and night. It is surrounded by drug dealers and national guard troops. I was appalled by the conditions, especially considering the price, and am still working to resolve with the management, so far to no avail."

I have had two deep tissue services at the spa at Era Tulum by Alma. It was beyond a deep tissue massage. It was a spiritual experience like none other!!! I highly recommend visiting Tulum for the sole purpose of having services by Alma. She is a healer
I had a wonderful experience here the staff was so friendly especially Fransisco & Jesus they went out of their way to be kind and talk with me. The people there were very kind and open minded to everyone there and there are people from all over the country at the hostel. It is pretty clean and comfortable as well
Che hostel is perfect for solo travelers! You will meet people from all over the world and you will just have a good time! The stuff is super nice and helpful and the Che experience team offers great trips! Especially Stella did an amazing job! Thanks to everyone!
The property and room was very beautiful and clean. There is little Cenote on site. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The breakfast they provided was the best I've ever had as a 'included breakfast' ! The beach is just across the street and you have access at a very nice beach club very close by.
"The location was beautiful and the rooms were clean and spacious, however, you can find beauty basically anywhere in Tulum.  I was there for 4 days.  I spent thousands of dollars on dining and the room.  One time at breakfast I was double charged.  I could see it immediately on my bank transaction.  The waitstaff said I actually didn't pay.  I showed the manager that I was charged twice and I wasn't going to pay a third time.  They said that it was a cancelation, but my bank showed two debits, which I showe"
"We thought this was a lovey hotel, nice beach minimal jungle decor and lovely staff. Breakfast was also good with lots of options. The location was a bit challenging for the length of time we stayed so we had to rent a car, it was realistically too far from the beach and at the far end of town so we needed to go further out in car/taxi once we’d been to the neighbourhood restaurants (however they were great! See my other reviews for thoughts)   The only other comment is the pool, the seaweed in Tulum was re"
A very good place if you want to visit the city and its surroundings. Location very close to all city life. All the staff was very helpful and always on site and their attitude created a great atmosphere. The apartment is very spacious with a beautiful terrace from which you can watch the sunsets. We will be happy to return there someday  Place 5* Service 5* Location 5* Vibes 6*
I booked a stay with Casa Teka but after cancelling my trip they still haven't refunded me my money. They are dishonest about the transaction. I was suppose to receive a full refund but they kept over $620 of my own money for a fee. They have a lot nightly fee but have super high taxes/fees. Don't let this tactic fool you.
" spending over $4,000 at Kai Tulum.   I've asked them to refund me for two of the charges but they keep saying it will be refunded eventually.  I talked to multiple staff members. I'm telling you, do NOT stay here.  They really don't take care of their guests at all."
"This quaint boutique hotel is well located for your Tulum visit.  The star rating is appropriate, though some may be way more critical.  The staff and proprietor Richard are the best part because they are so warm and helpful.   I would definitely stay here again on a future trip.  Thank you for the great experience."

We stayed at the Mayan Monkey in Tulum which was a 5 minute walk away from Teetotum and the attached Lola Cafe. We walked to Lola Cafe EVERY DAY for coffee and breakfast. It was SO good. Highly recommend.
"Anola, Eddy, Lucio & Jorge made us feel like home. Super attentive and welcoming, always trying to make sure that we had everything we need and they were simply a joy to talk too!   The rooms have an excellent decor and the ambience is very relaxing, you can spend a full day there without even realizing! We didn’t managed to go for the spa treatments, but we’ll make it next time!  Miss you all and we can’t wait to go back there again! 🤩"
"Setting. Overall setting is beautiful, nice comfortable bungalows, with beautiful terraces where you can (partially) see the ocean while drinking coffee in the morning that they bring to you. It is right by the beach (literally a minute a way). The beach club is spacious and not busy even when the hotel is full and some external visitors walk in. The beach itself is nice and clean. Yes, there are boats right in front of the beach and you get occasional petrol smell. Yes, the bungalows do no offer much priva"
"We ended up spending a total of five nights at Teetotum due to a change in travel plans caused by Hurricane Zeta.  This is a cool little hotel with a great owner and staff.  It's conveniently located so you can walk to downtown eating places and shops and it is a quick drive to the beautiful public beach.  The room was large, there was plenty of hot water and the AC worked great.  The best part of our stay was the people.  Richard, the owner, was very helpful and fun to talk to.  And the restaurant staff wa"
"The hotel is very aesthetic, and the rooms are nicely presented with Tulum style decorations, and are big and spacious and have air conditioning.   The pool in the middle of the hotel is also a great feature, but a bit dated with a crack in the middle. The hotel had a problem with its boiler and water supply during our stay.   The shower is not reliable and runs hot and cold sporadically. One evening the water stopped working altogether. We complained to the reception and had to wait for hours outside our r"

Wide range of choices and generally found everything tasty and enjoyable albeit expensive. Chefs were open to accommodating special requests to cook for our toddler, which was appreciated. It would be nice to have more fruits on the menu. Supermarkets are crammed with watermelons, coconuts, papayas, pineapples - why more fruit bowl and smoothie options aren’t on the menu is perplexing.

"Richard and staff are awesome. They make sure to take care of guests and their needs. I booked this hotel because it has a 5 star rating on TripAdvisor while being inexpensive compared to other hotels. I would say it lived up to that rating. Also, this stay is during the whole pandemic and I'll say they're ensuring safety of guests and proper checks were in place before entering the facility.   The hotel is in between the main town and the beach. They have free bikes available for the guests. The hotel itse"
 manager was never there and the junior staff were unable to find a solution by themselves (change our room).  They seemed to take our complaint personally and ignored us for the rest of our 3 day stay.   Breakfast (which was included) was a simple Mexican menu but very nice. The juice tasted very watered down though.

Will stay again as they offered 10% off for repeat visits!"

"I decided to go all out and spend nearly $1,000 a night on the best sea view suite at the resort after reading lots of good reviews. To say i was shocked when shown to a little room with a sea view if you looked down a street past lots of people looking back at you is an understatement. I felt sorry for the young man checking us in who had made us pay in 7 instalments because their card machine would not take large amounts. They made sure we paid the full amount before showing us the room. We were constantl"

Relaxed, low key atmosphere. Super friendly, helpful staff provides hand sanitizers, public areas are cleaned after use. Best location on the road to the beach and close to town. Free bikes and pool. Best Fish Tacos!"
"Era hotel was a tranquil stay amidst the hustle and bustle of La Veleta in Tulum. The rooms were very simple, yet elegant and the staff each day were phenomenal in helping us with each need. A special shot out to Anola and Daniel for being so helpful and thoughtful every day with our requests given our large group size. The SPA there is truly one of the best experiences I have ever had in my life."
"Teetotum has an cute, eclectic atmosphere complete with plants, fun pops of colour and the lovely dog in residence: Dahli.   The restaurant serves delicious food with an amazing 25 peso taco Tuesday. AND they have a daily happy hour from 5-8pm. It really doesn't get any better than this for value to quality folks! Their house made habanero salsa is so amazing, I am considering asking them to bottle some up for me as a gift. But be warned- it's picante!  They're right on the road to the beach, so whether you"

"We stayed at a hotel down the road and found oursevles eating at Teetotum most of the time. Lovely staff, great service and great food. Everything is always available (you go tp other restaurants and they say they have run out of items). The food and produce is fresh and so well cooked and presented. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito (should be for two people!) and the tacos - best we had in Tulum! Such a lovely relaxed atmosphere too."
They do 60 min full body massages for $35. They have happy hour all day. The food was AMAZING. My favorite flavors of my trip. Get the pork tacos and ceviche. Staff is so sweet. The ambiance is perfect for photos. Bed cabanas on the beach. Its a must see!
"We booked a room for a week and checked in first night, so far so good. We went out for dinner and when we returned to our room there were cockroaches everywhere! Huge cockroaches, at least 20 we counted.. We called the staff to help us out find a solution. They were not able to provide us with another room that night and we were not going to sleep in that room, so we had to take all our stuff and run out at 23:00, finding another hotel room was super difficult at that time of the night.

But from there... First of all, the place was expensive, but the room.. seriously.. we were eating by mosquitoes every night, the aircondition was to small to cool the room - probably because the roof wasn't sealed and there were cracks and holes in the floor, which gave free entrance to both cockroaches and even a b"
" came to greet us or make us feel welcome.  The hotel is located quite south and all taxies have fixed prices. That means going anywhere is extremely expensive (compared to mexican standards) and eating out? Oh my good. We basically starved ourselves, because we simply could't match our budget to eat out in Tulum 3 times a day. That is not on the hotel, but Tulum. It is a horrible place. We felt so sorry for our kids."

"Ive seen some of the other reviews and not sure how you cant figure out that accommodation was a shipping container. This place had everything I neded for working remotely. I was ON THE BEACH, quiet (this can be a real problem in Tulum) Steps away from the water. Massage on site, Bar/restaurant on site. I loved this place. Only reason I gave a 4 instead of 5 rating was the room could use a small refrigerator, and a couple of chairs."
"Deserve zero stars   The rooms are shipping containers with no windows! The bathroom is outside of your container, outdoors, and looks like a public restroom, it smells awful.   If you don’t like small spaces, you shouldn’t stay here.  If you are a former prison inmate and homesick, this place might be for you"
"On the pictures, they don't show you that you'll be staying in a repurposed shipping container.  Check in was full of drama since they didn't have my reservation (made through TripAdvisor).    The shipping container hotel room is extremely cramped, with an external bathroom that is actually outdoors so you must leave your shipping container to use the toilet or shower.   No toilet paper.    The air conditioning for this small unit is extremely powerful so you either freeze your a$$ off or you swelter with n"

The rates are very reasonable. Especially for apartments that are well equipped with comfortable beds, good showers, and kitchenettes. The location is fantastic - open the glass doors and you have your toes in the sand. Waking up in the morning to the sound of the waves and a beautiful sunrise is what life on Isla "
This hotel was practically empty when we stayed. We saw two other couples once each during our three days. It was clean and comfortable BUT felt like a cave as we were given a room without windows except to the public passageway so blinds needed to be down the whole time so there was no natural air or light. It felt like a dark cave in the daytime and at night the hallways lights came in through the cracks not allowing darkness for sleeping. Why on earth wouldn’t they give us a better room when the hotel wa

This is NOT a 5 star room on the 5th floor.!!!! It is a clean comfortable room with kitchenette on the ground floor. From our sliding door to the beach is about 6 feet..!   The waves are about 50 feet away.. Yes we loved it..!!!
A great pace to stay if you are in Tulum. The staff were very helpful and knew Tulum very well. Rooftop bar and swimming pool is a nice addiction to the trip. A great place with everything close by. Highly recommended.

The hotel is in a central location with all the amenities yet has a relaxed jungle feel and is away from the noise of the main street."

But, Azul Tulum contacted us via WhatsApp on the day and gave us details of how to get into the hotel and our room via passcodes on the door. This was so helpful for us. Then we just checked in properly the next morning.   We predominantly had Brenda at the front desk who was super helpful in recommending restaurants, organis"

" really need those anyway as the journey we took was all pavements and a bit of dirt road.   Taxis are a must in Tulum, it feels very safe in Aldea Zamá to walk around, but further out on the dirt roads and main roads it's easy to feel on edge - especially at night time. As two women, we decided to get taxis in the evenings or if the journey was very long (we got a taxi to Playa Tortugas). However, we live in London and it felt no more dangerous than London.

My favorite was the hotel is family run and operated.  Husband, Wife, and Daughter manage are onsite managing everything.   They are warm, welcoming and caring."
"We absolutely loved our stay here. It is perfectly located two blocks from the Main Street and the ADO bus station, which makes it quiet, but easy to walk to super cute restaurants or catch a taxi/collectivo to go cenote hoping. The air conditioner is COLD and the WiFi is strong. The hotel is adorably decorated with beautiful plants, bright colors, and unique touches. They have a gate that is always locked, so we felt super safe. But what made this place a true hidden gem are the hosts! They made us feel so"

"Dirty, unsafe, rude staff. That sums it up. If I could give this hotel less than one star, I would. I booked a room here for a two-day trip to Isla Mujeres and walked smack dab into one of the most upsetting booking experiences I've ever had.   To start, the guy at the front desk was playing on his cell phone, totally uninterested in checking us in, and then couldn't find a key to our room. We stood on a patio and waited for about twenty minutes while he dug through a desk and finally tried every key on a h"
The staff was awesome and I will definitely stay again. Close to the beaches which I walked to and the amazing Pepe Soho exhibit at the Mystika museum.  Rooms are spacious and bed very comfortable.  Definitely try the restaurant the food was great.

However, the staff and BIWA were so incredibly helpful and attentive that I just had to share it with the world! My friend and I showed up in Tulum with absolutely no idea what we were going to do. The staff at BIWA helped us plan out each and every day of our trip and even when plans changed, they did their best to accommodate our wishes. This hotel is great for trips for friends or young coup"
"Unique property located just off the Main Street and close to the ADO station, which was helpful for reducing the noise. Room was simple with no major issues except for in-room wifi generally not working (but it consistently did in public areas). Room wasn’t cleaned during stay because apparently you MUST put the green sign out (which wasn’t necessary anywhere else in Mexico or anywhere else I’ve travelled). Guillermo is wonderful and explains everything well."
"Docked here for 6 hours and was charged for 24.  Also was charged $5 usd for each person that disembarked....  (onto the dock).  Fuel price was average for the region but the staff were very rude and abrupt.  I would expect a bit more since our fuel bill was North of 2700USD.  Staff told me to speak with MGT, (Federico) to complain..  at any rate, good fuel stop if needed, not much else.  (120ft docks are nice though)"
 which is about 20-30 minute bike ride away depending on where you're going. You can reach the Avenida Tulum in about 20-25 minute walk but it's an easy bike ride at 10-15 minutes. Expect some dirt roads though.   We arrived late and staff were kind enough to accommodate us. Can't thank them enough as they were very kind and extremely helpful.

" place. However, if you want an authentic experience in the heart of a Mexican city, do not look further than BIWA! Amazing staff, amazing little cafe downstairs, SUPER clean, and all for a fair price! I would recommend BIWA to anybody traveling to Tulum (unless traveling with young children, then I would recommend a resort). Special shoutouts to Bani, Cynthia, Carlos, Jose, and Margarito!! You guys made our experience amazing!"
"This hotel is located just 3 short blocks off of the main drag. We arrived via ADO and the walk to the hotel was very quick. We arrived early and were allowed to check into our room. He gave us room #7 and explained that it was a very nice room. It was on the third floor. You had to go up some very narrow spiral stairs to get to it. Very hard on senior knees, but doable. The room was very nice. Very Mexican, but clean, quiet and the air conditioning worked well. The water pressure in the shower was very poo"
"Had lunch at the Puerto Isla Mujeres resort and yacht club. I was not disappointed. The food was great, the place was clean. I recommend the place for lunch. I had the fish tacos and I was seated by the pool."
"Cold air conditioning, reasonably comfortable beds, the staff are helpful and happy to get you more towels, extra pillows or anything else you need. The shower didnt have strong water pressure but it got the job done. For the price, which is excellent, you get quite a lot. Minifridge in the hotel room is a great perk and there is a swimming pool in the courtyard which is nice and cool. There is also a shared kitchen down there which is great for cooking if you dont want to eat out all the time. The owners w"

" gentleman at the front desk was helpful with answering our questions but not really friendly.  All in all, we would stay here again, but would request a lower floor room. The hotel was charming and very authentic. The restaurant attached to the hotel was excellent. I will write a review on restaurant separately, but it was definitely a great asset to this hotel."
"Let me start off by saying, I have an Airbnb on my own property in Canada, so I know how things work from both perspectives.  Less than stellar reviews can affect an owner's earnings.  At the same time, I think it's important to be honest, bc other people make decisions based upon the information they read.  Plus side: In a central area on the island, where real people, i.e., not many tourists live.  Local restaurants, stores, a bakery & good sized grocery/liquor store, all within walking distance. The apt."
"Visited our friends at the marina and had  drinks at the pool. They told us the management is very strict  about *everything*. My wife left her sarong by the pool so we took a taxi back to get it. Guards at the gate refused to let us in to get it, nor would they look for it for us, saying we needed to buy a day pass. How absurd. Luckily a nice woman who was staying there went and got it for us.  Also our friends said they couldn't get the wifi to work. They get one extra star because the pool is nice and th"
"Darwyn was the kindest host we could have hoped for. He met us with a smile and such enthusiasm at the start of our stay. The hotel has a great sense of fun about it and the entrance is beautiful. If you are looking for somewhere relaxed, close to the port and with great staff this is your place!"
"We stayed at Biwa for two nights and loved it. We had a junior suite and it was huge! It had a nice kitchen, a big sofa and the bedrooms were clean and comfortable. We also loved the location and took the opportunity to rent bikes to ride around town. Lastly, we appreciated that the building took a lot of security measures and we felt really safe."
…
" warm.  Bedroom has working AC unit, wifi & tv.  Nice big, comfy chair for sitting, to read, etc.  And upstairs is the common area patio with small above- ground pool.  Lovely spot to get away from the beaches & just totally chill out.  Loved it!    Casa Zuzy is owned by a CDN, named Paul & Lupita, is currently House Manager.  She is a lovely woman, with excellent English language skills, & very helpful with any questions or concerns.  Could Be Better Side: No one was at Casa Zuzy when I arrived.  And yes, "
"For us, this is perfect. Has everything we need. Pia is an awesome host. She goes above and beyond for us. Marcy is a dedicated employee and keeps the place sparkling. The courtyard is full of foliage and lovely to just sit in and absorb he good vibes. We have become family with several other guests and made life long friends "
"This resort was part of our time share until it got sold to Diamond club. We spent a week or two there for several years. I absolutely loved it, great location away from all the noise from the downtown area. I enjoyed getting up early and walking around the neighborhood, seeing all the locals getting ready for work. The old lady on the corner juicing oranges, the kids going to school. There are some great places to eat right in the area, and the new grocery store is about a 1/4 mile away. Kash Keken is righ"
"My first day there I was joining my friend.The a c was leaking but it got fixed as soon as I told them. 2 days later , no hot water. I was only there for a week. They could use some repairs and maintaining things there. I would pay more for a properly up kept place. "
"We had a really nice stay at Hotel Paraiso in Isla mujeres.  It is definitely not luxury but there is great value for your money. The room had everything we needed, and house keeping came every day to change the sheets and give us fresh towels.  The room included AC which kept it nice and cool and our unit had a balcony with an ocean view, which was probably my favorite part.  The only con was that the wifi didn't work very well if at all in our room in the far corner of the hotel. However it did work by th"
"My friend and I stayed at Biwa for the first few days of our trip in Mexico and absolutely loved it.    In our opinion, the hotel's location is absolutely perfect.  It's on a side street off the busier main road.  The side street has lots of food and drink options so if you want to stay close to the hotel you've got options.  We ate at Mil Amores a couple of times during our stay and really loved it so give it a try.    The hotel is incredibly clean with great common areas including a rooftop area.  We foun"
"In the heart of down town Tulum, where you can walk to restaurants and rent bikes to go adventure to the ruins and beaches. Clean hotel with air conditioning, good drinking water, and friendly staff. The guy let us check in early without an extra charge. The restaurant downstairs is pretty fire also. We ate pizza and pasta a couple night here and it was delicious and inexpensive. The only downside of the place is it gets load in the neighborhood from all the festivities and you can hear everything so just b"
"My partner and I stayed here for the month of April 2018 and we are booking to go back to spend our New Year on the island!   The balcony is gorgeous, overlooking the street/skatepark/ocean. We enjoyed many delicious meals made up of local foods on this balcony.  The condo itself is tucked away enough that you feel set back from the noise of the North Beach... but close enough to everything. Around the corner we ate at the Mango Cafe. Had a special night at Pizza Mike's and could easily get a taxi any time "
3rd time in Isle 2nd time at Villa Amistad.  Stacy and the team are GREAT!  Perfect location with privacy but still close to town and the action.  Fun house to accommodate friends and family. Toys for the kids. Cold tequila and beer waiting when you arrive and friendly staff and maid service.  What more can you ask for!!! LOVE IT!
…
"Not a condemnation, but not exactly worth $50.00 per night either! Poor Wi Fi even by Mexico standards, about 17 seconds of hot water  , lots of Noise from Miguels Moonlight until about 2 most nights. The housekeeper is fantastic & very sweet. If it was $30.00 per, woulda been about right."
" resort is Playa Lancherous, not sure I spelled that right, the amberjack grilled over the fire is delicious. The resort is pretty quiet, and there was usually something that didn't work right, but overall it was a pleasant place to stay. The staff was always helpful and friendly. There used to be a restaurant on the property, but it was closed down the last couple of years we went. It was nice having breakfast under the 100 year old fig tree, as the iguanas came out in the morning."
"This is a basic hotel, but very clean and relatively close to all the old town activity.  The people that run this hotel go out of their way to make their guests comfortable.   I arrived as a stranger, a guest of other hotel guests, and felt that I was leaving as a friend.  However, casual visitors should be aware that, during the winter months, regular visitors stay here for extended vacations, and in the evening the courtyard becomes a busy (and boisterous) gathering spot for partying snowbird retirees, m"
 wouldn't hesitate to stay at this hotel again.  It was fantastic!
"   I am so excited to return to Casa Vista Alegre for a second time. A sincere thank you to the owner for making this little piece of paradise available/ affordable.  The owner of is gracious, communicative and friendly via E-mail/Text.  Casa Vista Alegre has a very special place in my heart: As, I fell in love on the island... with the man of my dreams in a place of my wildest dreams.  * * * * *  <3 Much Love from Canada."
We had such a great time staying here. The location couldn't get any better!! The sunrise is something you don't want to miss. People in the town are nice and friendly. Walking distance to all shops/restaurants. We hope to be back soon!
"My daughter & I stayed here for a week in February 2020. There are not enough words of praise for Casa Zuzy. , We stayed I. The family apartment on the main floor. We had everything you could hope for & the some. There are two other suites above where we stayed. (I didn’t get to see them). The roof is like an Oasis. With many comfortable lounge chairs and a small pool it was wonderful. The manager “Lupita” was absolutely amazing. Very pleasant. She gave us a welcoming walk through & was extremely accommodat"
"We stayed in a room on the first floor with a own kitchen and bathroom. The room is old but that was its charm as well. The kitchen was well equiped and the room and bathroom where clean. It is in the middle of the tourist centre but the rooms surrounding a courtyard are quite and it doesn't feel like your in the crowded town. There are bikes and stuff for the beach which you can use for free. We only saw the owner twice but that was fine with us. But it can be hard, iff you need something, to get it becaus"

"This is my third stay at Hotel el Paraiso.  It is my favourite place to stay on Isla Mujeres. The midrange price can fit any budget.  The rooms have everything you will need for a comfortable stay.  Beds are comfortable.  Ceiling fan, air conditioning, tv, microwave and fridge.  There is a nice pool and a treed courtyard.  The rooms are big and equipped with safes.  The neighbourhood is great, and you walk to super, the beach, the restaurants in minutes.  The owners and staff are superb and will help with a"

"I came here with my 11 year old daughter. It was so perfect. Even better then expected. The A/C was so cold I had to turn it off. the beds and room was clean, no bugs. Perfect location to walk to the beach or in town. The staff was very friendly. I felt safe, they have security cameras. And they have wifi. I would stay here again for sure. It felt like home away from home Mexican style. I felt like I had an authentic experience which is exactly what I wanted. I will be back soon. Thank you for the lovely ac"
"Brilliant sculpture of architecture and my favorite place to visit! Private pool and courtyard with your own iguanas, open floor plan and king sized beds render this spot luxurious and comfortable. I've been home less than one week and already am planning my next trip back. My birthday getaway with besties was ideal here during the pandemic. Vane stocks the fridge, arranges for the golf cart rental and doctor to come and give the covid test required to travel. Minutes away from the big grocery store, live m"
"The center of everything! I was afraid of late night noise , but bars and resturants close early 9-10pm. Its quiet. Our beds were very comfortable. The Hotel was very clean. We explored all day. Slept all night."

"AHMAZING place to stay, fully equipped kitchen for cooking, great balcony with a breathtaking view of the sea. The sunrises were insane and the breeze off the ocean was wonderful, we barely used the Air conditioning but it was perfect when we did. The pool was nice and private and the owner was available whenever we had a question about the area. I will definitely be back!!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
"My wife and I really enjoyed our weekend at Villa Amistad and all of the information we got from the host family with tips on the island!  The house is perfectly located with quick access to playa norte and access to the main roads to get to Punta Sur.  The house itself was great, an amazing pool with awesome views to wake up to with a good cup of coffee, an awesome pool and refreshing air conditioning to escape the heat.    I'd highly recommend the place to any groups and look forward to staying at Villa A"
"If you are looking for quite accommodation while visiting Isla Mujeres and a local neighborhood do not stay in Casa Zuzy as the location of property is extremely noisy. You can find other accommodation in this town south of the north end, that is very quiet. The noise consists of gas golf karts, scooters, motor bikes, delivery trucks, and barking dogs 24/7 passing this property that is located on a busy corner in the town."
The sol Dorado is an apartment style hotel most apartments have kitchens all the apartments are situated around a gorgeous courtyard.... The accommodations are very clean and the apartments are located in town a block away from the Caribbean Sea and a five minute walk to the golf of Mexico... The owners are very helpful and the property has a community closet in the courtyard on the bottom floor with all kinds of beach supplies that can be borrowed... 
"We were off season, so it was exceptionally quiet.  Quieter than I like.  Because  of the low occupancy the service staff was at a minimum, so it wasn't up to par. The resort is quite small and beautiful.  The rooms are amazing."
"Stayed here with my daughter, aunt, mother and elderly grandmother. Loved it. Everyone, including the kids were friendly & helpful going out of their way to ensure we were happy & comfortable with every aspect of our stay. My daughter forgot her ipod charger, they found one for her. They put an extra bed in our room. They put extra blankets on grandma's bed to make it more comfortable for her. Loved everything about this hotel except the noisy fridge which next time we will just unplug. So great to have the"

NEAT OUTDOOR AREA for dining, resting,enjoying fellow travelers company and yes LIVE MUSIC! Starting in afternoon jazz and other music drifting in from terrace bars, evening louder and LaTerrazza provides the main night time BEAT! other reviews that were negative about the music are probably Haters! I thought it adds to the charm of this posada.  Gun"
"When this came up on our search of what to do on the island, we figured we had to drive by, right?  It was pouring rain but we found it easily and stopped from the opposite side of the street to get a look.  It's a very unique house for sure."
"I stayed 2 nights with my boyfriend to this hotel. The room is small and we both found the bed very uncomfortable, however the price and the location were awesome. You can walk easily to the beach (10 minutes) or on the main avenues to grab something to eat. The room is old and dated, but the wifi and a/c worked perfectly. For the price it was perfect."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Casa Vista Alegre. Right on the Caribbean across from the skateboard park, the apartment was roomy as well as nice and breezy - we rarely used the air conditioning. The front balcony is a perfect place to watch the world in this little part of Isla - carts and bikes going by, evening activities at the skateboard park, ships passing - the wifi is excellent, we were able to use our ship tracking programs very easily. The apartment itself is well outfitted - very comfy king-size b"
My friends and I were in Mexico for a wedding. We decided to stay here as it had plenty of bedrooms and an awesome looking pool with a view. It did not disappoint at all with what we had hoped to discover. There were a few minor quirks but the property manager had them squared away in no time at all. I would definitely stay here again!
I came to Casa Zuzy and Isla Mujeres over the Christmas break. It was very easy to get to as I was picked up by taxi and taken to Casa Zuzy (houses are named and most taxi drivers know where it is) for a very cheap fee (50 pesos). The house was in a great location and looks great. I love the location because everything is a short walk. It is about a 3 minute walk and you are at the Ocean. I really loved this spot because there are some great restaurants around and some great walking. The apartment itself on
"Amazing apartments !! Large, fully equipped kitchen. The location is close to everything (supermarket, oxxo, on the main street and most importantly one minute from the sea) The hostess is charming and will help with whatever you need. Worth every dollar. A piece of heaven."
"We did meet Pia the owner. Seems very nice, but she left on vacation  the day we got there. only person around it was Marcella the maid..she was sweet and tried hard to be really helpful. But internet was a little spotty and the room was lacking in a few things. Loved the location. Wish we could have had a little more interaction with the owners"
"The rooms are very nice, and the staff is very friendly. However when we arrived our room wasn't ready, they then brought us to a room with the wrong beds, and it took us four hours to finally get it right. After a week of reminders, the manager did compensate us with dinner. The front desk staff is all very friendly, but only a few can offer any help regarding where to eat, what to do, or how to make reservations. The pool and rooms are well appointed, very nice facilities. The pool is huge, and has a foun"
"I had to cancel due to Covid, approx 1 week prior to our reservation (we were staying somewhere else for the first part of our trip).  The airline and other hotel were very accommodating.  Unfortunately,  I did not purchase the insurance.   I contacted to owner/manager, who was completely unhelpful and outright rude, ""hope you got travel insurance "" was his response. I am out my entire reservation fee,  over $1200. I even asked if we could reschedule our trip.  He was unresponsive.    Now that I've canceled"
"Staying in this nice and small hotel was great. A nice and clean room-apartment, with fan, ac, private kitchen and big fridge. You will need a little getting use to a toilet being in the same room as your bedroom and separated only by a low wall and a curtain, but a part from that it Ok. Music from the bar across the street can be a bit too loud, but it didn't bother us. Everything is right on hand and in a walking distance.   Only thing that ruined a perfect experience was that no one speaks english in thi"
"If you are looking for a place where everything fits perfectly, and has all the comforts of a 5 star hotel, this place is not for you. But if you are looking for a quiet getaway, in a 3rd world country environment, this place is fantastic! The woman that runs it takes care of your every need. We stayed there with my handicapped brother (can't use his left side) and his wife and had a terrific time! She picked us up at the ferry, had our meals delivered, showed us where to get a golf cart,....I could go on a"
Awesome hotel in the center of everything but it's very quiet. The rooms are always clean and the owners will make you feel at home. You won't find a better deal and the beds are super comfy!  The water is hot and the air is cold ! what more could you want in Paradise?
" upstairs entrance faces the rear of the property, nice cool breezy place for morning coffee if the front balcony is too bright/warm. Pool area is very private, surrounded by a wall. Pool itself is about 4' deep with stairs and it was well maintained during our stay. One area of the yard is protected from the sun with a canopy, and there's another sitting area poolside as well. Parking for two carts on front. Good security - bars for all windows and sliding glass doors, locked door to rear of property. We d"
Perfect location - short walk to playa norta and to centro.  Walking distance to and from ferry.  Village itself was amazing with small infinity pull looking over ocean and walking path from gated entry below.  It does need some attention.  Cushions on couch very hard and stained in places; one pillow on the couch was almost totally threadbare on one side; cushions on loungers on roof shredding; holes in some of the sheets; towels and bathmat (received after requesting) frayed; lights bulbs out in two areas
 then this is the place for you. It was very clean and exactly what I was looking for. I can't wait to come back to Casa Zuzy!!
"I stayed at Sol Dorado 5 nights. It's an excellent location and the hosts - Pia and her son, Pascal, were outstandingly nice. You can also go on a diving tour with them and get a good price if you're staying at the place.  The only downside for this room was the linens, which I felt were bit old and outdated."
" rooms for it to actually be usable. Cab fare to the more bustling regions of the island runs about $5, which we found to be better than using a golf cart. There is parking for golf carts and scooters if you want one."
"Steve and Lindell are the most outstanding hosts with an amazing property.  The property is beautifully maintained by the caretakers who live on site and are always ready to lend a hand with your luggage and whatever else you may need.  They'll even pick up your groceries for a minimal fee.  The pool is great, the beach is great, the places to rest and relax throughout the property are amazing.  We can't think of anywhere we'd rather stay."
This place is between 2 night clubs that BLAST music till all hours I actually had trouble listening to TV. The place is spartan but adequate but the noise was intolerable to me. There are better bplaces
"That'll do it for a short stay if you're budget conscious. It's central and cheap. My biggest problem is that the in-room toilets are not separated from the beds (there's a wall but it doesn't go up to the ceiling), which is kind of an intimacy problem if you're sharing the room with friends...  Free wi-fi."
"I just drove by to look at this house - worth doing if you have a golf cart for the day! Can't see too much while still being respectful of the people staying there, but it is easy to pull over across the street."
"The hotel is a basic hotel in town, and within easy walking distance to the beach, bars and the ferry dock.  It is not fancy, but it is clean, the a/c works well and the wifi was good.  For 500 pesos a night, it is a very reasonable."

Steve and Lindell were perfect hosts, the property is beautifully maintained and perfect if peace and relaxation is part of your vacation. The pool is great, 86f all day long, there’s palapas, sun louggers and the beach is very clean. By golf cart you can get just about everywhere in 15-20 mins. To the south…..

"The Hotel is really nice; Great staff and owners Gunner and Gladys, clean rooms with microwave, blender, toaster. Great hot water, great balcony and outdoor kitchen for hanging out with fellow guests.  Of course as other reviews have pointed out the hotel is right in the action, with restaurants, bars, stores and night clubs right outside the front door.  If you are going out at night this is really convenient but don't expect a quiet evening. Hey. It's downtown. Music starts at 9 pm and goes to 11:30, midn"
"Completely adorable accommodations with all inside accents shells as well! 2 master suites with king beds, not child friendly due to second level open balcony and work being done in the back yard. The pool was perfect and the tourists love to drive by and stop for photos, so privacy is not 100%. Kitchen needs work but is fully usable. The lovely Vanessa lives next door and will assist  and make arrangements for most anything you need. Near the south end, all restaurants and beaches are a short golf cart or "
"Have stayed with Lucy and her family every time I've gone to Isla and would never stay anywhere else. It's like staying with family. Regardless of what you need, Lucy and Juan will do anything they can to accommodate you. The price point should make you realize that it's not luxurious, but rather, a clean and safe place to lay your head at night, get out during the day and enjoy all that the island has to offer. It may be a simple abode, but it more than makes up for it with the countless ways that this fam"

"We had all three units for a week with our extended family. It was such a great place to use as a home base. There is lots to do on the island, much more than I expected. We were very close to the beach, great restaurants, and the downtown tourist area.  We saw Mayan ruins, a sea turtle farm, and lots of local Mexican life. It was great to see the kids playing at night and get a glimpse into the local culture. There is always a lovely breeze on the roof patio. We decided to rent a golf cart to get around fo"
"Great family run apartment hotel in the center of ""town"" close to the ferry and beaches. Nice terraces for star gazing or sunning. Shady courtyard with hammock and turtle fountain. Simply appointed units of practical design. No oven, but two burners and fridge were good for breakfast and leftovers.  There are beach chairs available to borrow and some books in the small library closet. Cold a/c and hot shower. Very helpful owners make the difference!! Good value. I stayed on the ground in unit 1."
"We Found numerous Cockroaches, the toilet was plugged, the shower has a window in it where the upper suite can watch you bath, my key broke in the door and Pia made me pay for it to get fixed, the suite beside the surf shop is VERY loud!! Unpleasant experience."
"Rarely met an hostel so fun, caring, keen and genuine.  The hostels is clean, rooms are ok, all beds have there own outlet.  The kitchen is suppose to be the gathering place which is not that inviting. The hostels would be gaining to give more information on what to do on the island."
" little puppy called Kooka (don’t encourage her into your room, but feel free to spoil her.). AC was very good, WiFi was a little tricky in cottage Sam but outside around the pool was good. I’d say Makax could be a great extended family venue…. Rent all the cottages and enjoy the island. We’re certainly going back!!!!! Obviously the busy nightlife up in the north of the island isn’t right outside your door, but for us that was ok. We still went to town most nights for dinner…. Fish’n’gin, Jax, La Kantina, D"
It's the perfect little treasure with wonderful owners rent the mopeds go around the island it's the best! There's a wonderful community kitchen with everything that you need it centrally located right in town it makes you feel like you're a resident instead of on vacation
I actually rented the upstairs apartment that is owned by the same family that owns the Shell House! Let me say first they are so dang wonderful there is no reason not to stay in either location! I did find the apartment on AirBnB but it is not listed here. Just know that these ladies will go out of there way to make sure you are accommodated. I will be staying at the Shell House on my next visit. It is way more beautiful in person! You will not be disappointed.
 single room key at the front desk when heading out. Leave your old book behind for trade at the front desk. Fill your water bottles at the front desk water cooler. Pack light and maybe bring along camping kitchenware.
My girls and I just got home from our 6 night stay!  It was a great location and great view!  The kitchen came with all you need.  We stayed in the upper unit and it was very roomy.  King size bed was huge and fit all three of us for our entire stay with room to spare.  The pull out couch is the kind that folds out to the floor....daughter wasn't too crazy about sleeping on that but it was fine.  The shower had the best water pressure that I have ever experienced on the island.  AC worked great but just a f

The house is in excellent condition, with a gas range/oven in either unit and all the dishes, pots, pans and utensils you need. The owners provide clean linens and towels, and there is daily maid service included.    The location of the house is a real asset.

"We stayed at Casa Zuzy in La Luna for 1 week and really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is a good size, plenty of space and a large balcony. The rooftop is a great place to chill out and watch the sun go down.  We loved being amongst the local neighbourhood; hearing kids playing in the street, people heading off to work & the local businesses getting around. The sounds of the neighbourhood were lovely (and some of the music was very catchy!) There are plenty of shops and supermarkets nearby, as well as lots"
"On the plus side the staff is polite and the beds are comfortable. Pretty much everything else was not so good. The bathrooms are dirty and small. Make sure you get a room with a/c because the ventilation sucks and it will get unbearably hot otherwise. The kitchen closes at 1030 for no apparent reason. The WiFi is iffy, drops out a lot."

"we came for 3 days but left to another hotel after one night because of the noise. the room was OK but the bathroom was seperated with a curtain and there was no wall so it wasn't so nice. the bed is super soft so if your partner move you will feel it for sure and it is not comfortable. the windows didn't have a glass that was shut all the way so you can here anything outside, and it was very load at night (until 04:00am) because of the close by restaurants and night life places. it is clean and on the cent"
Had read about the shell house on TripAdvisor. We came across it during our travels. Very interesting architecture! Very cool in person! Apparently it's a rental home if you want to see what it's like to live in a seashell.

  It got pretty yucky after a couple of days.  There is a very friendly cat that will try to get into the apartment so make sure the screen is closed.  On our the last two days of our stay the neighbors started construction so the banging started at 8am on Saturday but nothing on Sunday and it was raining on Monday when we left. It really didn't bother us because we weren't there during the day but might want to check to make sure it is done if you intend to hang out at the apartment.  WIFI was great!!!
" cerviche are perhaps the best on the island. They were wonderful neighbors, and a ready source of cerviche and chips at most hours of the day!  I can't say enough good things about this house.  I have stayed in various lodgings in Cancun and the Mexican Riviera, and none came close to the quality of this accommodation.  Our housekeeper came by every day, cleaned the kitchens, baths and made the beds...and swept out the sand, pool cleaners stopped by several times, and bottled drinking water was refreshed d"
"The Casona is very well located just in the center and is easy to find; it's pretty well decorated which gives a nice atmosphere it's also near collectivos stop and there are plenty of restaurants around. The staff was nice and helpful, even if we didn't rent the bike but the price is good; breakfast was pretty correct : cereals, fruits...  The points to improve are that it's sometimes it's noisy when it's crowded and it would be good to have AC, the fan is noisy too."
"Not too bad, but nothing out standing either... bathrooms are cramped, but water pressure and warm water in the showers. The big failings are the wifi, just weak and dropping in and out all the time, and the heat! The rooms need air co soooooo bad! Barely slept it's so freaking got in the rooms. Fans only do so much. No windows in rooms to catch some fresh ocean breeze, building walled in on both sides so it's like a concrete oven"
"If you decide to save a few hundred bucks by renting this “gatehouse” instead of one of the other three casitas, be aware that you will be abutting the wall that faces a very busy and noisy road from 7am to 10pm. One of your two windows will be facing a parking area with a fair amount of comings and goings as well as a tool shed that is in use for repairs around the property. The other three casitas are beyond a low wall past a bit of better kept garden around a pool and with a view of the ocean. Don’t know"
"This room so comfortable we stayed for about 10 days, and it was a very good price (about 40  USD per night).  It was just a short walk to the beaches, and just off the main strip with all the restaurants and shops, as well as a full supermarket. The room had a full size refrigerator, microwave, blender, toaster and coffee maker! There was also a communal kitchen with tables and chairs where I cooked breakfast every morning. The wifi worked well in our room (upstairs) and the room was very clean, and the ba"
"If you want to stay in an art piece, then this is the place to stay.  The architecture and artwork are stunning.  The owner's are the BEST!!!! We will DEFINITELY be going back!  It's not a hotel, but an actual house!  You don't have to worry about crowds, you have total privacy.  You have your own pool!  The owner takes you on a personal tour of the property and she gave us a bottle of wine, bottled cokes, bottled water and cookies as a welcome gift.  Simply WONDERFUL"
"Hotel Carmelina is centrally located on a side-street on the north end of Isla Mujeres. Nearby conveniences include a good Padi-certified dive shop, supermarket (to buy cold bottled water) & laundromat. The ferry wharf is about 150m away, and north beach about 200m. We had a small double-bed room for 3 nights with air conditioning, ceiling fan & separate bathroom. In low season this was a mere 400 pesos per night. Wi-Fi is free but have to sit next to reception, but that is no trouble as it is outside in th"

"Nice and charming, the prices are really Low and u can enjoy a pleasant breakfast, colourful and cosy. 2 blocks away from tulum main square offers a perfect solution. It s possible to rent bikes so to easily reach the beach"
"Great vibe and lovely people, staff and guests are a nice and interesting mix, we loved it! The staff is very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Had to take a private room because the dorms were fully booked and it was very comfortable and good value. The kitchen is nice to cookand also the place to meet, would definitely come again! Clean, good wifi, nice atmosphere.. Loved this unique combination of people, highly recommended! Muchas gracias, que les vaya muy bien!"
 food. Perhaps the other casitas for the extra dollars have better amenities and are better maintained.
"I found the room to be very clean and comfortable. Our room contained a microwave, fridge and cutlery, very handy if your travelling on a budget. The a/c worked extremely well and our room had great Wifi. I would return to hotel Maria del pilar in the future, you get a lot for your money.  There is a little cafe on the closest corner that serves a great breakfast too."
"This is one of the most beautiful and unusual homes I have ever stayed in.  What a treat. We had seen it online and had visited the island before and drove past and joked, ""wouldn't it be great if they rented this place?"" and now... they do!  The logistic details: The caretakers are literally next door, but there is a wall, so you feel very private in your own oasis. We swam at night and loved it! We played our music outside. It really is your own space, but... if you need anything, they are right next door"
"The only thing we wanted to do was to get out of the room ASAP.... Maybe all the rooms are not the same but our was awful ...  La peggiore camera della mia vita pagata 700 pesos .... Un tugurio! La pire chambre de ma vie, sombre, AC tres bruyant, installations vielles et pas entretenues..."
"Such a wonderful stay and overall experience. Perfect stay to be in downtown Tulum and a bang for your buck.   Our hotel manager was very responsive and attentive of all of our needs. Unfortunately, our private pool got dirty from the rain, but she quickly cleaned it and was ready in a few hours. Even simple as needing more pillows.   Our room was super clean and loved how their cleaning staff would come everyday to clean the floors and re-make the bed. Since the floors would get dirty from our shoes and su"
This hotel had a jungle feel to it without being stuck in jungle. We were able to leave and walk right into town and the room was very cute! Alex was a very sweet host and was always willing to suggest places to eat or go have fun
"I stayed in La Casona Hotel & Hostel for 2 nights. It was my base for exploring Tulum and archeological site of Coba. I'm not going to write about standard as the place has it all, more or less, depending on your personal needs and likes. I will focus on details, which are important for a solo traveler like me.  First of all, cleanliness. The place is very clean and tidy throughtout.  Wifi service: free and good. I had no problem to upload a lot of pictures on social media, and surf on internet. Free simple"
"Nice tiny hostel in the center of the island, what would ask more? Helpful staff (Kelly from Brazil and Sara the owner were super friendly and helpful). Breakfast is good, for the price you pay, you can't pretend a 4* hotel buffet (so don't pay attention to this kind of comments).  Everything is clean and the structure is close to all the main attractions, if not u can always rent a bike.  If u want a cozy cheap place where to relax, that's what you need!   Keep on doing a good job!"
…
" late. They arranged for a taxi to met us at the ferry terminal (we did not pay for the taxi. They did). Then they were there waiting for us even though it was so very late. They had keys in hand, gave us a  tour, wifi password, ran back to get us coffee, creamer, sugar, fresh fruits for the morning. Just splendid people and amazing service! Beer and some sodas were in the fridge when we arrived as well. Water is from a very large dispenser on the kitchen and a refill water is there as well! golf cart parki"
"My Wife and I came to Isla Mujeres from Cancun to relax for a couple of days. We had no reservations and were walking around checking out lodging possibilities. We are glad the Hotel Carmelina was one of the places we checked out. It had AC, Refrig, Small flat screen TV, and WiFi. All for 500 Peso's. The Bed was hard for me, but my Wife likes hard Beds. The room shown in the picture is room #1, the room we stayed in for two nights. Yes paint is needed, but the room was clean and up to our basic needs. We wo"
 super slow and careful especially during the rain. I wouldn’t recommend to drive late at night since it may be a little too hard to see.   Check in was super easy and quick. The front desk will check for your reservation and then will connect you to speak with their manager or whoever your rental manager is. Our manager gave us tips and offered to help schedule restaurant reservations or beach reservations in the popular Tulum area which is by the beach.   The Location was only about 5-10 minutes from the 
"Loved my stay at Harmony! The staff are so friendly and they made me feel very safe and welcome. A solo traveler from Europe, I was made to feel at home immediately. The yoga room provided the perfect place for any yogis to connect with the jungle- vibes. Highly recommend! Thank you!"
" men and women. No queues. Paper towels, soap at the sinks and toilet paper. Big plus. Shower cabins with wall shelves mounted high enough to not wet your toiletries or clothes while taking a shower.  Buffet breakfast for free. Simple and good enough if you like coffee, juice, fruit, Cereals on youghurt, toasts with jam. Dormitory rooms have sliding not lockable doors but during my stay no one was robbed. Besides staff is on the premises. It's safe. Medium size lockers, you wouldn't fit a backpack. Bring yo"
A sweet hostel. People are really nice both employees and guests. I got to know people there that I'm still in contact with. The hotel is close to the beach The rooms are super clean although everything is outdated but what can you expect from a hostel? The price was cheap and everything was within reach. In the end we stayed for another night
"Friendly staff and clean accommodations.    Close to the beach, restaurants and local hotspots.   Nice little breakfast served in the mornings! :)  Rooms are clean and comfortable.   Awesome little shops and everythings is in walking distance,"
"Absolutely incredible, photos don’t do it justice. My boyfriend and I wanted a little slice of heaven that wasn’t a resort lined with beach chairs every 10 feet, and this was it. The privacy was incredible, the grounds were immaculate, and between the on site caretaker, Juan, and the owners Steve & Lindell, you couldn’t have asked for a friendlier, more helpful crew. Our palapa was in wonderful condition and we had zero complaints about cleanliness, comfort etc. The screens on the doors and windows allow fo"

"Harmony Glamping overcharged my credit card, admitted the mistake and after I sent several emails finally paid me back a portion of what they owed me. Over charges made on a credit card are payable to the holder of the credit card. Period.   Weeks after my stay they claim to have given cash to my friend who joined me for a part of my 4 day stay, and are subtracting that from the overcharge. There is absolutely nothing to back up this claim - no receipt from the company, no word to me at check out, and no af"

"I stayed here for a month while taking a certification course on the island. It’s downtown, but on a pretty quiet street. I stayed in a 4 bunk dorm because I booked late. Normally I would have booked more private accommodation, but there were none left (AC and price were my main concern). Overall I enjoyed my stay on the island. This is my second time on the island and expect to return.   Pros- Staff was nice and helpful, Location (close everything), free lockers ( I fit 2 cameras and a few other things in "
My husband and I had a wonderful vacation at Villa Makax.  We stayed in the Casita Grande.  We had a golf cart arranged for our stay and it worked out wonderfully. We are  familiar with the Island and getting around is safe and not a problem.    Steve and Lindell were wonderful right from the beginning of our booking. There is also a friendly couple who are caretakers.   And of course Lassie is a lovable pet who loves treat when she greets you.  We had plenty of privacy and took advantage of the beach area 
"The hotel is regular. Simple breakfast, unprivileged location. The room is very spacious but very humid. Everything seemed to smell bad all the time, and it even looks like the sheets were wet. If I was looking for a place to rest, I wouldn't choose this hotel again."
"Excellent place to visit, concierge was super accommodating with everything from ordering taxis for us to assisting in ordering alcohol for us. Pool is great, private pool on our balcony/roof was even better. This is a must stay. Leave the kids at home 😊"
" establishment.  It is a pretty place, was clean and felt secure but that means nothing when they take your money, or claim to give your money away to others.  On another note, the neighbourhood is not very nice to walk around and it is a very long bike ride or $30 usd cab ride round trip to the beach."
The resort now has a new name it’s called the Gramercy Hotel. It’s a small boutique hotel at the southern portion of the hotel zone on Tulum beach. Check in was easy and efficient but we did experience a slight delay in room being ready. We sat at there bar and had some drinks and 30 min later room was ready. The staff was very friendly and addressed some small concerns we had (safe batteries were low). Our room was an ocean facing room and it had a spectacular view. It was clean and bed was very comfortabl
The dorms are really nice and cheap. Breakfast is also included. The owner and the crew are so friendly and helpful! I really enjoyed my time staying at this place. I would definitely recommend it ...
"La casona was a welcome and lovely place.   With my boyfriend, we booked a private room for a really good price.   Honestly, it was even better than a hotel.   Casona workers were really friendly, they were always there to help you and give you good tips.   The place is also lovely with the small outside corridor and the beautiful color of the walls.   Thank you so much !   Romain & Justine (the French couple)  "
 swarm the hammock are and the kitchen area (there was a hole in screen door). Waiting until 9pm for AC ( I wasn’t in tourist mode/out and about all day) I spent a lot of time at hostel after my class so I noticed the heat more. I wish breakfast had fresh fruit options.  
"I'm so grateful we found this place located among the glitz and glam of the hotel zone in Tulum. We were somewhat shocked by it and La Posada Del Sol offered more what we wanted: down to earth, simple, easy going. We found the service at the small and independent run resturant wonderful, delicious, fresh, healthy, locally sourced. The rooms are bright and clean, with AC, with an excellent bed. The staff are completely accomodating and helpful. Our stay was comfortable, quiet, and exactly what we were lookin"
"The place is confy with a central pool and hammocks, our room (superior one) was large and nicely decorated  with really confortable beds and a clean and practical kitchen. There was also a free water dispenser, wich avoids buying tons of plastic bottles at the (very close) supermarket. In the end we had booked 2 nights and added a third one to relax before heading to playa del Carmen."
"""Security"" are the biggest jerks we have ever encountered - they and the unhelpful concierge made it feel like we were INTRUDERS every time we returned to OUR airbnb.  Completely unprofessional, rude and sketchy."

" and suitcases, and better service on the beach chairs it was hard to get a waiter to bring us drinks or provided service and at times felt I was an inconvenience.  This is the only reason this is a 4 rating than a 5. In the evenings you can take a cab down the road to some amazing night life and restaurants or walk. The walk was about 15 min. It was very safe. They also have bikes to rent it was about 40 min bike ride to the ruins. And across the street is a lagoon that rents kayaks for 250 pessos for the "
I stayed at this hostel twice and the second time I stayed for a month. Really enjoyed my stay. It's a simple hostel but it's super clean. The manager and their family make you feel like home. They have good coffee in the morning. Most of the time it's very quiet so it's a good place to chill. You can cycle to the beach in 15 mins or walk to the main street in 8 mins. Highly recommended!
…
"Buyer beware. The place looks nothing like it’s pictures. It’s run down, no care and No service, college spring break gross rooms, sketchy owners and staff. The whole place makes you feel unsafe. DO NOT STAY HERE!!! It is a complete waste of money, they will not refund A THING!"
"My partner and I have just stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay! Staff are very polite and helpful, able to give advice on tours, tickets and the area. We bought tickets for the Casa Tortuga Cenotes which was great, would definitely recommend. We enjoyed the pool area, it’s very tranquil. Rooms are nice, only downfall being our balcony faced on to the road which is extremely loud at night time which made it difficult to sleep. Yummy breakfast! Location is good, hotel is located just off of"
"The place is amazing, clean, good localization, good air condicioning, Wi-Fi, the room is absolutey beautiful and the staff is very friendly, you can find Grocery stores, conveniente stores in the city, Nice restaurants. Maria Vianney herped us. We highly recommend this place!"
We stayed three wonderful nights at the beginning of our stay in Tulum and we loved our Glamping. It was so comfortable and so inviting. Everything was clean and quiet. The service was fantastic . The shared bathroom and showers were very clean!   The location is close to the Main Street so close to the shopping and great restaurants and bars. Yet quiet. It was a little piece of heaven.  
…
"The staff here were so friendly. We arrived early but our room was ready and they let us check in well in advanced of the check in time. They even offered us breakfast as it was still open. Later that evening the manager was back and upgraded us to a private room with en suite (from a 4 bed dorm) which was a lovely gesture.   The hostel itself is open air, a breeze throughout, hammocks, games, books and just very chilled out. It’s a short 3 minute walk from the Main Street past street food vendors.   We’d d"
We stayed at La Casona for 3 nights in a private room and we liked it! The hotel is near all the restaurants and bars. The room was clean and the bed was pretty good! Jerry is really nice and made us feel welcome.   Tip: get some cheese at the supermarket 3 doors down and some avocado to put on your toast in the morning. 
"Everything about this place is a scam, dont fall for it - they took our money and gave us  NOTHING that was promised- doesn't look like the photos, the customer is never right, they were horrible, we left and paid to stay somewhere else -"
"If you’re into rustic shacks that smell like an ancient Grey Hound Bus, look no further. Bed are terrible. Extremely unclean and provides no value. You’d be better off pitching a tent. Clearly run by some very unsavory folks."
"Good location, 5mins walk from the Main Street of Tulum Nice room, enough space. Clean. Breakfast ok, few choices.  Early noises from the car wash next to the hotel, the only thing I could say that it was disappointing about this hotel."
"Everything Was Great The Pool Fantastic n  Ms . Mariah vianney  The Best She Helps Us Find Great Food , Great Activites N Etc Awesome Employees I Would Recommend All Tourists To Talk To Her She Fluent In English / Spanish 💯"
"We booked a Room for two, not a tent. When we arrived we have been shown our room at the upper level. No service with luggage or anything. Absolutely no knowledge of English language. We decided not to stay as we found hairs in the bathroom, experienced a strange smell in the room (mold??) and the AC did not looked as it was serviced in the last months.  We find that the pictures shown on the internet do not show the right impression.   We friendly asked to be refunded or solely pay for one night. Both was "
we came to Tulum for our honeymoon at first we stayed at casa violeta and IT WAS A DUMP!! and we had a horrible time so we decided to go outside to the beach for a walk and then we encountered LOS AMIGOS hotel we did not know the name of the hotel so we went in through the beach (the hotel and most of the rooms are on the beach) and we asked to see a room they where very nice and welcoming unlike casa violeta. we came back that very evening and reserved a room that was the best choice we made in tulum!!! su
This is one of our regular spots when we come to Tulum and it's the authentic feel and hominess that's the main reason. This year we jumped at the opportunity to stay in one of their new plunge pool rooms and it did not disappoint! The only reason I didn't rate the stay as excellent was because of the ongoing construction. This did not take away from our overall experience except that we did miss the boutique which was under renovation. The plunge pool room was awesome and I'd really like to stay in the oth
"The hotel is not located well.  The staff are great.  The manager is super nice and sensible.  The room we stayed in was on the ground floor and smelt musty when we got there.  Upstairs rooms are better generally.  Good breakfast.  We paid too much though.  the single bed was very uncomfortable, needs a thicker mattress."
"I stayed at Hotel Panoramic for two weeks in April. The on-site staff was very kind and very helpful. I had a power issue one night but everyone was very accomodating. Panoramic is a beautiful place to stay. I highly recommend a Penthouse unit. Regardless of size. I had a penthouse studio. The private pool is well worth its weight in gold. My host was amazing and very attentive to whatever I needed.   The frustrating part of Xperience Hotels is their accounting department. Upon returning home to the US, I w"
"I simply rented a bike at harmony hostal and encountered grumpy stuff of security when return after waiting 40 minutes just to be told off to come back the next day, because no receptionist was there to return to me my passport that I had deposited. There was no receptionist at 7:45 pm. I waited until 20:20 for the grumpy security to arrive and tell me that I can’t have my passport. They obviously have not communication between stuff members and no receptionist after 7pm. This created difficulty as I need m"

Great value; two yoga sessions each day (including one guy who is the best teacher I’ve ever had), outstanding breakfast, lovely massage, dinner (credit vouchers to use at two local restaurants - both great), beach towels and bikes.

So many pros to staying here - can’t list them all! The yoga and food are grest. Bikes loo"
 much Edwardo!!! and of course thanks for the whole stuff.  pros. rooms are on the beach STAFF!!!!!! breakfast amazing atmosphere and again amazing staff  cons. we really are scratching our heads for cons but we have to write something. the marketing for this amazing hotel is not strong enough   it is a bit far from the restaurants area in the hotels boulevard. it is expansive it is a good hotel but still we feel it was expansive
"This place in under construction and although the room was beautiful and the service was good, it was impossible to get away from the noise. Hammering, grinding, and sledgehammering all day. They're constructing another suite and a store. The wifi is awful. Don't plan on any work. The beach is tiny. It's better to stay in the Ecological Zone just to the north."
"DONT BOOK HERE!!!! THIS HOTEL Scams people! Look out for Karla Rocha and other receptionist...they seem nice and accommodating but they will take your money!! STAY AT ANY OTHER HOTEL, there are too many nice hotels to book here. WAS RIPPED OFF $591."
"My friend and I just stayed at Aroma and we had an amazing experience! The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone wanting to get a little of everything that Tulum has to offer. It is bike-able to pretty much everything you could want like cenotes, the beach and the centro strip. It was a huge plus that they had bikes for rent in the main entrance! The staff was incredible and so friendly. They were quick to get us anything we asked for and even just to provide helpful information and recommendations fo"
"Great spot, super cozy suites with the authentic mexican vibe! Functional rooms, great shower, super clean and quiet at night. The lady at the front desk was very welcoming! Strongly recommend the superior suites! "
"Firstly, the hotel is not near the centre of Tulum as advertised. It is in a dodgy area on the very outskirts of town next to a strip club.  We walked 2km from the centre of town to find the place, only the find the receptionist said we did not have a booking. Because the place looked terrible and nothing like the Booking.com listing we decided to leave it anyway.  Later the same day my credit card has been charged $3600 pesos which is more than the original stay was even supposed to cost and they won’t ref"
" feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem, but keep this in mind while booking."
"It was my first time sleeping in a tent,it was a really great experience. Some humidity inside the tent with some ants but not a big problem. Sharing bathrooms and showers were great I never saw people there and it was always clean.  Staff were so quite and very nice."
…
"Definitely a boutique, nothing Luxurious but we feel it was fair for what we paid. It was further than walking distance  to all the nightlife (10min ride) and the taxis ask FAR more than expected.   The beach is beautiful, and the simple breakfast included was nice. Staff was nice, and we thought the service was good. My biggest complaint was the AC, they only allow it to run from 9pm-9am.  If you’re looking to save money this is nice, we had the garden view which was a quick walk to the beach and we enjoye"
"Terrible service, no attention to details and no AC during the day and the WiFi is terrible. Also they were doing some construction and the noise woke up us at 6am!!   Karla at front desk was nice but Alex who watches the property at night was rude and knocked at our door at midnight asking for payment even as we have agreed with Karla to pay cash next morning!!   Terrible experience, skip this one you can get much better hotels in Tulum for the same rate and with better service. We ended up canceling the r"
 bit dark with all of the black but still very comfortable and matched the vibe of the whole place! We would definitely recommend staying here and hope to be back again someday!
"My sister and I stayed here for 5 nights while on holiday. Initially we had not booked for 3 because we weren’t sure if we were going to stay in Tulum the whole time; they were very accommodating when we decided to stay longer and matched the online price without prompting. We found the staff friendly, location great (close to town but about 5km from beach; we hired bikes and there was a nice footpath the whole way!). The included breakfast was simple but totally fine and unlike the other reviews we had no "

Its a really nice place to stay for a beach club its not too expensive and the food (i had octopus ceviche) was very good. You should go there the service is really nice and the beach is beautiful. We had a perfect stay! 
We left our car on the hotel’s parking to have dinner in a restaurant just next to the parking without knowing it was a hotel’s parking. There is no sign to mention it.   When we came back from the restaurant the man who manages the parking claimed us 150 pesos or... a soda! A soda! If we gave it the money he probably kept it for him not for the hotel he works for. If we don’t give him something he’ll send our numberplate to the police.   Hopefully the restaurant’s manager we went to gave him a soda and the

I was in the hotel for 3 nights the service is great. The staff very friendly. Great location. The hotel gives free bikes for the guests. If You have plans to visit Tulum Aroma Tulum is a great option
"As we were travelling during high season, the hotel prices were really high and so Uolis Nah was one of the few that fit our budget but seemed still a decent hotel. It has a cozy inner yard, nice breakfast and although it was expensive, compared to other hotels in Tulum, still had relatively OK value for the price.   The worst thing with this accommodation was a neighbour-rooster who was screaming all night! Luckily we had ear plugs, but still.. We nicknamed the place ""Petuh-nah"", with ""petuh"" meaning ""roos"
" and still had the same budget, I would maybe choose something closer to the city centre."
"Beautiful destination; amazing staff, excellent accommodations! Everything we ate and drank was delicious and our rooms were large and comfortable. The beach and view are priceless and we could not have been happier!"
"We came here 2 years ago, just before the Pandemic hits, and we had a blast ! Great functional room, nice breakfast, great service, and they had some great bike we could use for free!  2 years after - what a change, but in a bad way.  The warm welcoming was gone, the room look extremely run down (furnitures, probably something to sit on, was missing… and instead 2 huges plants pots were there, empty but a bit dirty inside…see picture), and the whole place look tired… The place is made of concrete and there "
"I waited a few hours before writing this review, I was so mad and needed to calm down before. I might have given a better score if my check out incident didn’t happen I’m so sorry Eduardo. Here is my story. Management gives excellent service. The room was upgraded at our arrival to full ocean view. At my birthday the cleaning lady decorated my bed with ballons and confetti, that was very much appreciated. The beach was beautiful and white, cleaned everyday.

I payed cash and left tip and went back to my room with the drinks. What happened to my money?? I don’t know. No communication between staff? A mistake? Dishonest employee that put the money in her pocket?? I don’t know!! But I do know that I repayed the bill at check out because I was in a hurry. Left absolutely insulted, "

"The experience was excellent. The hosts was nice. The food was good. They let us ride that bicycle, my husband love it.  The room service was great.  The security was nice.The host gave us Cheaper price for adventure. Me and my husband had so much fun. I will recommend this place."
"It has been an incredible experience, so clean, safe and the warmest people that you can meet. Do not miss this place in your next visit! The security and friendliness are been important factors to travel in Tris beautifull country. Do not miss AROMA TULUm in your next visit."
"Very nice management/ people, everyone here is nice and friendly also Lupitta the manager helped a lot and she speaks English pretty well. There free breakfast is amazing and their kitchen is bomb! I always ate here before going out. The hotel is calm and comfy to stay in relaxed. It’s just 1 street inside downtown so from here you can walk or bike (offered free) through Tulum Centro. To go to beach clubs in the beach area its a 15 minute drive. You would need a cab or rent a car. I recommend renting a car "
"We come to Tulum every year and we finally found the authentic Tulum style ! Exactly what we were looking for. A little paradise with the best energy . The breakfast with the other guests, Roberto the owner , and Alejandro the therapist ( he is physical therapist ) not only a massage therapist . It was the best TREATMENT I ever had ! Fully recommended"
"La Petit Shambala is a beautiful property located right on the beach, a great place to wind down and enjoy the Caribbean.   The beds were comfortable, and the view from our room unbeatable.    Roberto and his staff gave excellent service and were very accommodating, we even got some help to plan the rest of our trip to CDMX."
"Shambala is full of love. Everyone who works there is kind and approachable and very helpful. The healthy food is delicious and full of color. The location is special. The cabanas are unique and you really live on the beach, with all the weather and sea creatures! Watercraft is available, a cool infinity pool,  and everyone walking by on the beach stops to take in the magic of this place.  Tulum has changed a lot since I was there 20 years ago.

This beautiful resort is right on the beach and as far as I know has the only beach front pool in Tulum This incredible hotel is set right in the heart of Action! The owner Roberto and the staff were incredibly welcoming, warm, kind and helpful and attended to my every need and desire! What I love about this place is that you get a true authentic beach hut vibe with a modern internal design and a beautiful garden"
"You will never get a better experience than you will find during your stay at Shambala Petit. There are so many thoughtful touches around this resort that show just how much they care about making your experience effortless.   This place offers tranquility and privacy while still providing exclusive access to the best beach spot on Tulum beach.   The owner Roberto is the nicest man you will ever work with and has lived here for over 20 years so he knows all of the best spots to eat, drink, shop, and party. "
We rented all the rooms at Shambala for our wedding party in Tulum. It made our wedding experience amazing! The location is perfect in the beach zone. The rooms are authentic but really pretty. The grounds and the pool are what make the hotel a perfect spot. It's the only hotel with a beachfront pool. Roberto and his team helped organize food and drinks throughout the weekend so it felt like a mini resort. We loved our stay!
"Booked 6 nights at Shambala expecting this to be a ""rustic"" experience. Arrived and got my room, ok more of a hut. Air conditioning was marginal due to the large 2"" gaps around the doors and other misc. air leaks. Was ok with that. Went into the bathroom, no hot water. It was hot & humid, so I was ok with that. Can't drink the water here and no bottled water provided. Was not ok with this and had to go down the beach to a restaurant to purchase one. Was extremely tired from traveling all day so went to slee"
" Still fighting to get the other 5 nights $ back and to top it off, I got double billed, once by the hotel and once by Booking.com. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!"

"I was here recently for a yoga retreat.  This is not an American style hotel.  Essentially the rooms are huts by the ocean and some are partially open to the elements.  There is air conditioning but it runs only from 6 pm tp 6 am.  Hot water is spotty at best.  Expect to share your space with lizards, insects and the occasional iguana.  You will be given two only bottles of water, but there are free refills in the public areas of the hotel.  The rooms have sliding doors with padlocks and you will carry your"
"The 2 bedroomed apartment is huge and very clean. There are 2 sofas and a huge 6 person dining table and chairs in the vast air conditioned lounge. All of these are easily accommodated in this vast room. The tv worked fine and you can use your usb on it. There is also free wifi.  The bedrooms were air conditioned and are a really good size, the beds and pillows were very comfy.  Both bedrooms come with their own en suite bathrooms and showers.  The hot water showers are excellent and have 24hr hot water and"
" any other clothes or items you might have. There is extra towels, bedding and a safe for you. Storage is definitely not a problem in these rooms.  The kitchen has all the equipment if you want to do self catering. It has a gas cooker, fridge, microwave, plates, bowls, cutlery, cups and a coffee machine with free coffee pods and tea bags supplied daily, although they could be doing with getting a kettle. It also has two sinks to put your plates etc in.  The room is meticulously cleaned every day. They suppl"
"We were told it has laundry. But there was no laundry. The beach is really nice and very quiet. Seaweed isn't even horrible like some other parts in the area. 1 little cove to snorkel but there is a tour boat with 10 people visiting every hour. I was told this resort is set for demolition in 2 years and it shows. Its fairly run down. Pool was more like a slough. No way I was getting into it.  The bbq on site is a pile of rust and lizards.  The sand is really nice and clean, the staff are friendly and bar se"

Caleta Tankah has so much potential if they did some renovations and cleaned up the property. This is the perfect place to go if you're torn between denote or the beach. The caleta was super clear. The cenote is a bit rocky but perfect place to take a dip. The food here is disgusting so don't even try it. The drinks here as well were not good at all. Better just ordering shots. The staff wasn't attentive at all. For $15 cover fee I guess you can't expect much. I would come back just for a chill day for the 
"This is hands down my favorite place to stay in Mexico (I’ve visited this region 20+ times). Although the description is “a room” it’s basically an apartment with a kitchen, dining table, and a sitting area. While the property is spacious, clean, safe, and huge the real gem is the staff! Sabine is an angel and her recommendations from dining options to excursions were always top tier! I really debated about reviewing this property because I love it so much and want to keep it as my private sanctuary but I l"
I here about it went to try it! All I can say supreme and is hard for me to say that!! Excellent quality and great service and not overpriced. Located in downtown so you don’t need to go down to the beach for a good food. Will return for sure since I live in Tulum.
"The Location was amazing. The staff was great. Adriana and Jorge were amazing, they gave us some good hints where to go and what to visit.  Adriana took the extra mile to make our stay absolutely spotless and absolutely unforgettable. We had the best room in the Posada with Ocean view, and every morning breakfast was served in our balcony."
"The place is great, but the service is horrible  such a big disappointment for a great place and the poor service, I was waiting for 1 hour for the waiter, and I have to ask for a menu because they dont let u in with food buy they either offer, so I asked for a menu and then I have to wait long time for my order to be taken"
"We loved everything about the Azura Boutique. Right from booking Sabine was amazing, she was so helpful: she organised our bike hire and gave us loads of great advice on where to eat/things to do etc. The apartment is really spacious and very clean. It looked exactly like the pictures, except bigger. We loved that they provided a drinking water dispenser, it saved us buying bottled water all the time. The apartment is in the town, really close to great restaurants and bars and it’s such a lovely cycle to th"
"Me and my boyfriend booked the Domo accommodation via Airbnb for two nights and it was amazing!  Such a cool place, eco friendly, good vibe, staff is very kind and customer oriented. The price is fair compared to other Tulum accommodations and the beach club food and drinks are super good (totally recommend the all you can drink draft beer for 350 pesos!). Looking forward to staying in this piece of paradise again, thank you!"
"Loved staying here, would highly recommend the room with Sea view. The staff are all friendly and while it’s not 5 star luxury, it’s quirky and perfect for simple accommodation to experience Tulum and what it has to offer"
"The beach at Tulum (zona hotelera) was not nice this year, and a local recommended us this place.  We were surprised of how nice the beach was here. The food and drinks were affordable. If we have known of this place earlier in our trip we have had visited it more often.  It is only 20 minutes away from the zona hotelera.  The entrance is 300 Meccan pesos per person approximately $ 15 Dollars per person, which includes the beach chairs, umbrella, and parking. There is a bar, restaurant and bathrooms on site"
"We stayed in the Azura for 4 nights in Jan 21 and we can 100% recommend the place. Sabine does a outstanding job, from the welcome, to the customer managements until the check out. She is carrying about her clients like a mother :)  the location is perfect to get around Tulum citiy. There are many good local restaurants in foot distance. the room are very clean and pretty. the roof top with various small pools are perfect to escape from very busy Tulum.  Access to the beach is very easy by bike. Sabine will"
"Pros: The hotel itself is actually amazing. We had one of the most basic rooms, which provided everything we needed included a fridge. Enough space.  Taxis always available outside.   Cons: The staffing was just basically non existent. We were there for over a week and we were not told once that we could access the hotel next door for all their amenities including the pool! On check in the lady read out the price of our room and informed us that we had booked our room via booking. Non of which was needed to"
"I loved my stay at Niik Tulum. The room was very clean and so were the common areas. The swimming pool was very cute and loved that I could swim there at any time, really. It is a nice, centric hotel in Aldea Zama and the stuff was the best of my experience, to be honest! On my second day, I rented a bike at the hotel and I totally recommend doing this to move around, it changed my experience completely!"
"The Concierge provided excellent customer service by holding on to my necklaces I left behind. SO GRATEFUL for Jose Antonio Roman, who personally delivered my necklaces to my friend's hotel. THANK YOU"
"If you are looking for authentic Tulum charm, Posada Lamar is one of the must-book boutique hotels on the strip.  Still close to the new trendy restaurants and nightlife but enough serenity to enjoy what Tulum was originally discovered for - it’s healing magical charm.  I stayed in the Ocean View Loft Room (Zefiro) which was spacious with a balcony overlooking the ocean. There was a ladder in the room which allowed you to climb up to a private loft area to watch the sunrise or sunset.  There is no door to t"
"Stay away of this place, the manager is the most useless person I ever met, thay gave us a price and tried to cheat changing conditions once in place, do not visit them terrible food and service and managed by a beginner with no idea of service. They will try everything possible to take your money"
" again a special thank you to you and the team. we will recommend your place to whoever we know and intends to go to Tulum. The rating is speaking for itself.  Cheers, Klara and Chris (Switzerland)"
" pool location, I spoke with 2 people. One person said there was 2 pools and the other said something to him in Spanish and proceeded to inform me that the only pool available is in the hotel.   When we asked for water at the front desk we were told they don’t offer that at this hotel and we had to walk to the nearest shop which is about 10 mins away. Only to discover our neighbour receiving room service with a meal and drink the following day! By the way we weren’t informed that we can have room service de"
"Our stay was absolutely great and we enjoyed every minute of it. The area was nice and clean with few nice restaurants nearby. The room was clean, quiet and spacious with comfy beds and AC. The staff was super helpful and friendly. They helped us with transport from airport, bike rental and a Chitzen Itza tour. Me and my parents felt safe and welcomed. Thank you!!  I wouldn't recommend booking the tours through them, but it's more negative towards the tour company EasyTours than the hotel. We didn't fully g"
"This hotel is leading by example in terms of environmental policy.  They have refillable shampoo and shower gel bottles, electric car chargers and solar systems in place, plus many other things. A great example to many.   The apartments are clean and serviced daily.  The rooms were slightly smaller than expected but still nice.   The pools were clean and security on site was good.   The bar and restaurant were on reduced hours as we were there during winter months. A ten minute walk gets you to the Main Str"
 Tulum. We were never bothered by noise or construction problems.   I am a keen runner and found running in Tulum safe and relatively easy once I worked out a nice route.   The gym at the resort is very good and the spa (reviewed separately) was excellent.   The resort is a bit secluded but the walk to night life is only ten to fifteen minutes and there are plenty of taxis. 
 the perfect connection. It was strong enough to allow calls and zoom meetings throughout the day.  There are no fridges in the room but the hotel provides coolers so you can purchase ice and beverages from the nearby market minutes (walking distance) down the road.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating.  There is a beautiful pool area with two swings and a sun deck with day beds. Below are more day beds on their private  beach area.  If you need a beverage while you tan - feel free to walk next do
"Is a beautiful place just next to the archealogical zone of tulum.  We were recommended to go this place by our host in the hotel that we stayed to. In this season there is a lot of seaweed in most of the beach clubs from Tulum, but this is not the case. This beach club is so beautiful and there is no seaweed because the ""caleta"" (a place were  sweet water from the underground rivers called ""cenotes"" meet the salty water from the sea. There is also a cenote a 15 mins walking from the caleta that is also inc"

"Stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed the experience.  Location is very convenient close to all amenities and we did not suffer from significant noise issues. Room was huge and well equipped particularly if you want a bit of self catering.  AC was good, shower pressure ok, towels, bed and bedding of a good standard.   Staff were friendly and helpful albeit a little “sleepy”  Outside space both private and public was a little overgrown and cramped. Breakfast was rather uninteresting.   As I said good but with a li"

"You can hear everything through the walls, even the toilet flushes. Its new and clean and the rooms are big, but if you want a decent sleep, forget it. No restaurant and its a distance to get to one. There is no coffee machine in the room or teapot. The price is good for Tulum."

Lovely little guesthouse - superb location on the beach. We stayed in the big room directly overlooking the ocean - fantastic large terrace to have breakfast every morning which was delicious. Very friendly staff. Two things on the negative side - no bar or snack service although there obviously had been one there recently. The air conditioning time restriction from 9pm - 7am is a bit harsh - the room was extremely hot in the afternoon when we came back from the beach and the free standing fan was not adequ
"My boyfriend  and I’m arrived the last week in May 2021. The drive into the condo area is on a long pot holed road..so do not come in a nice car. We did not mind that..lots of yuccas on either side and iguanas to look at. Sometime they have a manned front gate..but this was very hit and miss. We arrived at our apartment ready to rest after a long day of travel, only to be utterly dismayed...the condo, on the 2nd floor was disgusting. Please see photos to understand how completely awful this place was...blac"
"Lovely boutique hotel with an amazing rooftop patio and plunge pools. We only spent one night here and wish we could have stayed longer. Fantastic sunset views from the rooftop patio, very safe area and close walk to the high street with a useful shop opposite.  The rooms were spotless and the included breakfast was lovely. Will be the only place we look at if we ever return."
"3 night stay in Tulum. The positives: the room (Monet) was large, well presented and clean. Staff were very welcoming and the location very central. The parking had actually only space for 2 cars at the rear, however there was on street parking nearby. The negatives: breakfast was very simple. Very little choice, warm coffee and only available after 8am. Tricky if you have an early departure for tours etc. Wifi was dreadful. Very little connectivity, could easily be rectified with boosters installed in room"
 find out if valuables could be left somewhere safe other than in the room. Hotel is nearby a rather loud bar or club so noise was loud until the early hours. Not a problem if you're out yourself until late but can understand it would be a problem if you need an early night. Overall a bit disappointing for the money paid. There are much better value for money hotels within walking distance away from the main road. Unless they rectify the breakfast and WiFi I won't be visiting again. Having said that the sta
"Our stay at Hotel Watal was an absolute blast. As soon as we arrived, we were welcomed by the most friendly and helpful staff (Didier & Sofia). The apartment is beautiful and clean. As a visitor you get access to all the facilities of hotel Copal which is right across the street: the gym, the spa, a cenote, the restaurant etc. If you’re looking for a peaceful and calming atmosphere, this is the place you’re looking for. Would definitely recommend!"
We visited their hotel in March with 2 children. The hotel was super clean with lovely big rooms. Staff were really friendly always willing to help. Breakfast was thee best absolutely fantastic!! Would highly recommend!
"We stayed for 5 nights. First off be sure your driver knows which Los Amigos Hotel you are staying at as they have 3 sites and our driver was very confused even after giving him the address.   We booked this hotel because we wanted something more secluded, in nature but close enough to walk to town. This hotel was not as described at all. Pictures show and describe lush trees and jungle surrounding the building which may have been years ago but this is no longer the case. The area is developing, lots of con"
"What a beautiful little spot, we are so glad we discovered it! Posada Lamar is tucked away in a quiet area on the beach away from the hustle and bustle of all the nightclubs.   We love that it’s a smaller hotel so there’s fewer guests around and each room has its own private entrance. This is great especially during COVID times.   The rooms are very spacious and modernly decorated. The bed is super comfortable and there’s lots of room to put your belongings away onto shelves.   Most importantly! The beach i"

When we told him we wanted a full refund , he told my boyfriend that HE would have to cancel.

"The reviews about this place are completely right. This is such a great place to stay in Tulum.   It is so clean, professional, friendly, and feels a really calming space. The apartment has everything you might need and more. Especially loved the gorgeous smelling toiletries, bath robes, welcome drinks and snacks, fully equipped kitchen so we could cook for the first time in months on our travels, Netflix and WiFi that worked, unlimited drinking water, air con machines in the bedroom and kitchen/seating are"

Copal Watal was very accommodating and staff were amazing. Anything we needed they made sure it got done for us with no hesitation. They were close to all the action. Maybe only about 7-10 minutes away from the strip. I would definitely return back here.
"The location is nice and secluded from the town, and closer to the beach, which is a huge PLUS! I felt much safer here than what I would of felt in a public resort, tbh. They have really good personel and the food is delightful with the seasonal fruits of the region. Memorable!"
" The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from town, though we discovered the bulk of town is at the opposite end of the strip.   Overall the hotel is nice, just not what we expected."
" is amazing. Check-in was a breeze. Front desk staff is very friendly and accommodating. The grounds staff are constantly cleaning the pool, raking the sand, tidying the beach, and tending to whatever needs doing. Daily housekeeping staff do an amazing job refreshing your room.   Breakfast delivered to your front porch every morning consisted of fresh fruit, yogurt and granola, toast and preserves and coffee or tea.  You can add on eggs or hot cakes if you want for an extra charge.    My husband and I have "

While you can take it back to your room or eat at a little table in the courtyard, we preferred eating at the big table with as many other guests that wanted to join.

Such a beautiful hotel would absolutely recommend it!!!!Everything was always clean and the stuff was amazing. The hotel looks exactly like on the pictures showed maybe even better. Would also recommend to rent a scooter or an atv for your stay here because by foot it’s possible to reach a supermarket and the beach but it just makes it easier to drive!
"This place is just perfect. The staff is relaxed, warm, friendly, competent. I was here with my daughter and we both loved it. The hotel is impeccably clean, the food is great, the decor is clean and elegant while still feeling comfortable and in harmony with the natural surroundings.  The staff was very welcoming and there was always someone available to help us. Marcel (or was it Marcelo?) was extremely helpful in helping to orient us, give us local tips, arrange bike use, arrange taxis, etc.  I would rec"

"Amazing, cozy boutique hotel with best ocean view in TULUM. Super clean ant tidy.   Not to many rooms, so overall we did not feel to many people around. Our kids were super happy about pool. Almost all the time we were by the pool alone 🤫  Rooms in this hotel are unique, because of ancient and fantastic design details.  Super warm and pleasant personal.  We always had parking space.  We were afraid, that will be noisy from around places, but we do not hear music from around.  I was fishing in the sea right "
"A wonderfully comfortable and relaxing place where you can truly be yourself, clothed or not. Beautifully landscaped, large inviting 24/7 pool, hot tub, and bar, and splendid accommodations. Easy access to Tulum and beach. Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and sociable, along with providing world class service. Excellent menu and chef onsite. Highly recommended!  This clothing optional resort is best of class in our book. This was our second visit here and we hope to visit again and again. If you"
"My headphones missed inside the room and it’s been locked all the time!! I’ve sent a message to the hotel but they haven’t answered me since now. Any kind of compensation hasn’t been offered. It’s quite a violation to the right of free property. That all made my last trip days bothering . That never happened to me before. Hope at least they gave me the value of a brand new phone. It was a Jabra elite 75t active.  Don’t recommend.If you go there, take all your valuable belongings with you. Maybe it’s right i"
" really easy for us. I know waiting on people can't always be fun but they made sure that it always felt like they wanted to do it. If you want this is a place you can do it.   I really can't say enough about this place. If you don't want to stay at a resort, and actually want to experience México and it's people, you have to say in the city. By the way it gives you far more access to everything getting out of those pricey resorts. They are really just for people who want to go to another country but not ac"
"Lovely apartment,Fantastic staff  Little bit of a distance to the beach but we hired a scooter in the end easy access to the town,all in all really nice place to stay you can use the pool next door or the one out the back which is regularly cleaned"
We threw a retreat at the hotel and it was lovely! The design of the hotel is simply divine. The staff was wonderful and the food from the kitchen was great. You truly have to see it to believe it. Highly recomended!
"We stayed 3 nights over the Easter weekend. Room is absolutely great with mod cons. Location is ok down some unpaved roads 10 minutes walk from the main road through Tulum. It's a bit of a building site in the surrounding area, and the view from the small rooftop pool therefore isn't that great. Laundry services was also outrageously expensive ($10/kilo) so we held off from using it.  Overall though it was a really nice place to stay and, partly as a result, we really enjoyed our time in Tulum."
"Amazing long weekend spent here and we were sad to leave. Truly magical and relaxing, laid back in a tropical paradise. The food was amazing, delicious and plentiful. The chef went above and beyond with gluten free dishes and excellent presentation. No matter what the other reviews may say, we will be BACK. I found the vibe here so chilled out, the room was beautiful, clean, comfortable. The patio to have morning coffee on was like being in a tropical setting. The drinks made by Joel were some of the best w"

We loved staying at Watal. It is perfectly situated in Aldea Zama.  We had stayed a week at their sister hotel Copal Hotel with family - it is equally amazing ! But then we wanted more of an apartment for the last week of our trip so we could work and cook as needed. Watal had a great set up for exactly this. We stayed in a 1 bedroom flat with ensuite. It also had a cute terrace. The staff were lovely and super helpful. We didn’t like the first room we were in but the staff understood and accommodated our r

I cannot begin to tell you how amazing the manager and staff at Niik Boutique Hotel were. They went above and beyond what you could imagine to help me and to make my stay comfortable!  Every person here was friendly,  helpful and professional. The Manager, Alvero was incredibly kind and helpful and Marcel was so helpful,too. The room was clean. And the food at the res"
We really enjoyed our stay at Tago Tulum. The service was amazing and the rooms beautiful. Only regret is we didn’t stay longer. Great small hotel close to restaurants and beach.  The best mojito on our trip to Mexico. The private pool was also amazing. Honestly I couldn’t find anything wrong with our stay! Highly recommend.
" apothecary like properties of many beverages. Sarah was so wonderful and attentive also preparing drinks, serving food and with such a sweet personality and beautiful smile. Office staff Valentina and Betsy went out of their way to help us in anyway possible.

We booked one of the condos during our 7 day vacation in Tulum and it was awesome! It felt like we were in a small air bnb with the security and perks of a hotel! The condo was huge and I loved that there was no tv! The bedrooms were the only rooms with AC but the rest of the house had ceiling fans which was not bad at all despite how hot Tulum can get. The complimentary breakfast was so delicious we got it almost every single morning. The staff were super sweet and accommodating and helped us so much with 
"We had a huge, modern stunning apartment overlooking a tranquil pool with lush gardens. The reception staff were really helpful, including Franco, Florentine and the guy who showed us our room/complex. Elizabeth, Senge and team in the restaurant at Copal were great too. Amazing place and a very reasonable price. Highly recommend!!"
"The Niik boutique hotel is located in a very cool quickly developing area of Tulum situated between the beach and downtown with easy access to both. Just minutes from amazing bars, restaurants and the beautiful beaches in Tulum.  The hotel itself is first class including a small restaurant and chef willing to customize meals to your taste. All the staff was extremely friendly, easy to communicate with and knowledgable of the area.  We don't usually brag on but this definitely was a top notch place on our li"
"STAY HERE! You’ll be glad you did!   Luis, Ricardo, Enrique.. all the staff were amazing!  Service was impeccable.. multiple turn-downs and room prep every day.  Fresh veggie arrangements brought to our cabana on the beach- we didn’t even ask for them.  Location is spectacular… place and the service can’t be beat."

" well! Everything within walking distance! The only con is that being located in the center of the city it can get noisy at night, but that is to be expected and really didn’t bother me. Overall I definitely would recommend this hotel if you’re looking for a fun stay in Tulum! "
"This hotel was unlike any other that we’ve ever stayed at. The property itself is private, but walk out the gate and you’re surrounded by amazing restaurants and beach clubs. The staff are AMAZING, they will help with any questions and will accommodate you with any thing you need. They are so pleasant and friendly and make your visit feel so personal. Our waiter, Pedro, even started to teach us the Mayan language! The rooms are nice and spacious and come at a great price. The food is fantastic-the included "

Franco, Ismael & Brian were very welcoming and accommodating and gave great advise on where to eat and go. There is a beautiful restaurant across the road that you should definitely check out. If you’re concerned about your safety, there is 24/7 security who are very friendly and respectful. The rooms are beautiful and the entire property is clean and refreshing.

"We’ve been to Intima before, but this may be the last time. First of all be prepared because the restaurant and the bar have been working different closing and opening hours. This is somehow annoying because you need to go out every single time in order to get lunch or dinner, NOT EVEN COFFEE IN THE MORNING! so annoying!!!. Also, If you’re someone who’s looking for a little party/socialize THIS IS NOT THE PLACE!!! When the bar is open (mostly in the morning) there's this DJ who happens to play the most bori"

I called them about ten times before our stay and they were so nice and answered all of my questions.  Armando arranged our pick up and drop off to and from the airport and Myltha arranged for our group to rent a van for our cenote day.

Early to our reservation so they offered to put our luggage locked up in their office.They have a beach club which was extremely relaxed with sunbeds/chairs/bar. Service here was incredible. We opened the door to our room and our jaws dropped. It was gorgeous! Better than the pictures! Clean, new, modern, had all the essentials.  Air conditioning! Aesthetically by far the best room I've ever stayed in. The balcony was perfect & private overlooking the ocean. We ha"
" that forced her to leave. We felt sorry they had to go through that, since they had been nothing but kind to us every single time we had been there. Hopefully someone teaches her some manners to that lady that lady we found out was called Ana. The only good thing about this place is the attention from the staff, they make the best they can with whatever they have."
 was that they provided us with a huge jug of drinking water! It was so nice to have especially during the day. I can't say enough about Cabanas La Luna - stay here and you will see what I mean!
"Just returned from a five-night stay at Tago after a few nights spent in Izla Mujeres. Very sweet little place. I love the overall design of the property -- the rooms and spaces are simple and understated, very elegant, and the lush gardens feel green and fresh. It's really lovely to come back to a cool, clean space and dip in the private plunge pool after a day in the heat on the beach or exploring cenotes or tromping through the dusty streets.

" definitely weak/skimpy on the alcohol, but they're really inventive and yummy. Two drawbacks I'd cite: 1) there is no real pool, which would be nice as during many months, the ocean isn't pleasant for swimming and the beach is even a bit unfortunate due to an overrun of seaweed, and 2) the whole sand-everywhere-thing including the entry ways/walkways gets old really fast -- you just don't really want sand all on your feet and everywhere else all the time. Other than that though, it's a cute little place th"

The sweetest ladies kept our room fresh and spotless the entire stay, and the vibe of our fellow guests and staff has left us missing both, as we reminisce warmly from home.  Thanks all for a fantastic visit!"
Great location and friendly staff. Our spot was located directly on the beach and their little water buckets for the sand on your feet were a nice touch. We also had direct access to the pool. The bar/restaurant is very yummy and the included breakfast beachfront is a plus. Make sure to ask for the ‘welcome drink’ which is like a virgin mojito.
"Hello, I would like to share my feedback about staying in Tago Tulum.   1. On the first day of our staying in a hotel, one of the guests stole my shoes,black slippers Versace. In the morning I didn’t find them, so I asked at the reception if someone had taken my shoes. Unfortunately, I didn't get any feedback after 3 days.  On the third day Betty showed me a video where one of the guests (who had already checked out) took my shoes. Betty didn’t have any contact of this person, so she sent an email saying: “"
I honestly don't know where to start. No electricity or hot water most of our stay!! Rooms are shabby!! Not what was advised or what you pay for!! Tulum is lovely though and definitely a beautiful place to visit
"This hotel is right off the beach. The views were amazing. Cleo & Fernando our servers were very friendly and welcoming! The staff provided great service, always very attentive to our needs.  We stayed in the Coconut Room which had  an amazing ocean view. Overall, this is a  great hotel to stay at!"
" Cleaning staff never  new towels for. Another thing is room cleaning was at 17:00/18:00, so our room was without service almost all day.  3. Every evening we heard  loud music. There is a party near your hotel, so we felt like we had a party in our own room.  4. When we checked out, I asked for a bottle of water at the reception because we had go to  Cancun (2 hours of road), I didn’t even ask  water for free, but I received an answer that we can get only 2 bottles of water during 24 hours, they gave us 2 "
"First of all let me preface that my husband and I have been in Intima about 5 or 6 times.  We received 4 free nights last year so we went from Nov. 9 - 15 on a whim.   Before you book with them, MAKE SURE TO ASK IF THEY HAVE POWER!  The power was out most of the night and some times during the day, which, of course, affects the A/C, water pressure (there's none during outage), fridge/freezer (don't open it), the stove (better have matches) and internet.

"True old school Tulum— funky, comfortable rooms, incredibly yummy breakfast and the friendliest, kindest staff, supplying us with whatever we needed all day.  The beach was incredible (I recommend purchasing souvenirs right from the local Mayan families that visit you in the beach). The room so nice, the hammocks and seating on our veranda the best!  They were so wonderful to my children and to us— Armando, Cleo, Pedro, Raul… just so great.  We splurged and had Armando arrange one tour — Siam Ka’an, on his "

"We had an amazing vacation in Akkuun hotel in Tulum. The hotel was amazing, the location  is the best and the beachfront was dreamy. They took such a good care of us, especially Santos from the restaurant  and Eddie from the front desk. We highly recommend!"
" the whole time, though.  I will go back!"
"We stayed for 5 nights for our first time visiting Tulum. The hotel is in a nice, quiet and new area. We were greeted by the very welcoming staff, who explained everything we could expect during our stay, thank you Ivan! The rooftop restaurant was amazing; a lot of choice and very fresh food, special thanks to Omar, Dayanne, and their team!! The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a very enjoyable and memorable experience. Beautiful rooftop terrace with a nice pool, a lot of cabanas, sunbeds and"
The food and views were absolutely amazing. The service was great and they were very attentive. Please ask for Santos and Eddie! They were great. I will recommend this hotel to my friends and family that decide to vacation in Tulum.

"Y'all my wife and I had the time of our lives here!  When staying here, you feel like ROYALTY! Everyone is so nice and the amentities are lovely. We visited other beach clubs during our stay and nobody could top the service at zamas.  Waking up every morning, you would smell sage burning outside your porch. This wasn't mentioned to us so it was a really lovely relaxing surprise! Whenever we came back to the room even after just a couple of hours we noticed everything was so neatly cleaned and organized.

"Casa Violeta was a welcome respite from the club scene that seems to have taken over the area. It was peaceful and serene, and while it is in the center of everything when you’re there you feel like you are alone in the world. The service and attention to guests needs was next level and the food at their restaurant rivaled any other restaurant in Tulum - and we visited all the top ones. Most of all the staff was friendly, helpful and so respectful while we were there - I feel like we made real friends, espe"
Akkuun Tulum was amazing from the service to the scenery to the food and staff! Santos and Edi especially were absolutely wonderful and made our stay the best it could be! 10/10 would recommend!!! Sad to be leaving!
"For our first ever trip to Tulum, we stayed at Cabanas La Luna. Hands down, this boutique collection of rustic bungalows is the essence of classic Tulum. The rooms are spacious, each with private decks or pools, luxury king size beds and AC units for cooling at night. The cabanas are situated around a pool and open-air restaurant, the latter with unobstructed ocean views. And, yes, the ocean is a mere 100 yards from the Cabanas, with private sunbathing areas exclusively serving guests. There are no TVs in t"
…
 propert.  The area that this is in in my opinion is the best location in the tulum tourist area. We spent a good amount of time in the downtown and it wasn't a far trip at all we also spent some time on the tourist side so you get a taste of everything. It's also quiet compared to the other end closer to the tourist side so it was a very rwalxing experience as well however there are still opportunities to party if that's your thing.  The restaurant attached to the hote is also top tier. Specifically victor
"If you are looking some place quiet, magical, tasteful this is it! I felt being at home, very peaceful, people are very respectful, the decoration is amazing, the bed very comfortable, the shower perfect, people that work there speak a perfect English and are very careful, will be back for sure!!"
"Santos is the best !!! All the people here is very nice! The food and service is very good The hotel is  romantic ,special and beautiful! We would like to come here again! !!! The room is beautiful !!!"
"We have had a lovely 5 days. The staff (incl. Santos) have been really attentive and made us feel welcome. The hotel is in a beautiful spot on the beach and well located for the hotel area. Breakfast was delicious. We hired bikes/scooter to help get to cenotes, Tulum town and the ruins."
So breakdown on the hotel   Service  Unreal . Staff amazing. Willing to help the hotel isn’t huge and I like that like the more boutique style . The staff that work at the bar round the pool are amazing.   Location  You are like 15 min in one direction by taxi from the down town . 15 min the other way by taxi to the beach . Loads of restaurants and beach clubs top restaurants are chill things near by . If like me you like the gym the hotel does not offer one but there is Los amigos gym a max 10 min walk awa
"Wonderful, authentic Mexican Caribbean experience with the most hospitable people in the world. Everything is always wonderful and we love going back as much as possible. We have been coming to the island for years and this is always our favorite place. Located in the colonias, you can watch kids play soccer, be near the beach or experience a local carnival or Mercado. And there are lots of friendly animals all around. "
…
"Superb hotel based in the quieter end of Tulum. Ideal for those wanting a relaxed/chilled vibe but perfectly siutated to grab a taxi and head to the party vibe when or if you wish.  We stayed in one of the Beach Front Chica, perfect for 2 adults and all very romantic.  We had our own hammocks, seats and sun loungers so all options covered be it shade or sun.  The hotel staff are supremely attentive and friendly.  The hotel operates a whatsapp system to contact front desk or room service and it worked beauti"
"I chose Apt. 3A because of the history of it being the home and studio of the artist/proprietress of Casa Isleño, Henrietta Morris de Avila.  It was a spacious room right on the parade route.  If there were any traditional processions taking place, we only needed to step outside to enjoy them, and in the short time of our visit, there were a few!  Altogether, the location was amazing.  Just steps from restaurants, shops, the beach right around the corner........within a few days, we were navigating the stre"
Ny Husband and I just returned from Zoetry Casa Del Mar.  It is a beautiful property - food was great and we felt very welcome.  My Husband - who never really relaxes - said it was the first place he has really felt relaxed and on vacation!  We want to give a big shout out to our UVC representative - Michelle Mondragon - she is wonderful!!!  So welcoming and will help with anything you need.  She contacted us before arrival and constantly checked on us while we were there.  I cannot say enough great things 
The stay at Casa Violeta was beyond expectations. Great and attentive staff that where very srevice minded. Wonderful food was a mix of Italian and Mexican style. Can highly recomend it. We stayed 4 days for a wedding.
"My wife and I visited Akkuun on our honeymoon and were blow away by the great service from all the team Inc Ed, Max, Juan and many others I didn't catch the names of. We had especially great service from the bartender Daniel. Thank you for looking after us Daniel and for the great chat and drinks! Food was amazing also."
 Amazing hotel all round and perfect location . So happy with the stay here !  
"We stayed in the Luna apartment for three nights which was great. It's really spacious for two people. The kitchen is well equipped, the bathroom is nice, the bed comfortable, AC and fans available, TV, DVDs, books... so many little details that were just nice! Wish we could have stayed longer.  Sue was great with all our questions and the people that lived on the ground floor were lovely. The taco stand down the road is great. My husband ate there every night. Bear in mind though that the apartment is at t"

" on some renovations.  He was incredibly helpful and welcoming!  He made sure we had everything we needed and detailed the best spots for food, golf cart rental, etc.  There were plenty of towels, a coffeemaker, fridge, bottled water, a hotplate.....but really, with the exception of some snacks, fruit and beverages in the fridge, there was no need for cooking.  Fresh, delicious, varied, and inexpensive food was widely available.    We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and I like to think that we got a sense of t"
 airport was there for us.  Both of these gentlemen took care of us on the property and made sure we were happy!  So happy to have been there - and cannot wait to return.  Felt like family.  Food was great - loved eating on the beach - lobby bar was quiet and a peaceful place to relax and have a drink. I could go on and on - but highly recommend this place and the people whom I mentioned!!  They made our vacation the BEST!!!!

"This is a great hotel for families, couples, or anyone looking for a nice but much more relaxed hotel in Tulum on some of the best stretches of beach.  We selected the Magnolia villa since this was large enough for our family of four...but it could have easily accommodated at least five.  We were only a few steps from the beach. The space was a great balance of upscale refinement with a heavy bend towards the integration of natural elements including a palm tree literally going through the wall and up throu"
"Santos is amazing,very kind,funny and professional. I reccomend staying at Akkuun hotel. The staff is on high level. This is for sure luxury hotel. The rooms are beautiful, tacos delicious and the beach is beautiful."

 and don't mind being away from the center I'd definitely recommend Capi's apartments.
"Food was amazing and the deserts are the best!! The restaurant and area are absolutely stunning, amazing for pictures with a beautiful sunset on the beach, and Jorge is the coolest (and great at foosbal). We <3 Zamas!"
"First and foremost, the staff; Carlos, Jacqueline and Ramon are THE BEST. Whenever we needed anything, someone would magically appear, yet they were somehow never in the way.   The private beach is one of the best I've seen. The sand is raked daily and there were plenty of chairs for our group of 8. Also umbrellas for shade of we wanted.  Zama's beach club is a short walk down the road and has good food and drinks and a pool if you want a break from the beach.  I really can't say enough good things. Highly "

"Our stay at Casa Isleno was a great pleasure!  Located right in the middle of town with food, drinks, bars, shops and beach all in walking distance.  We were lucky that Rob the owner was there to meet us and introduce us to the local culture.  Our room was well prepared with supplies for our stay.  We truly enjoyed our week there and would certainly visit again."
"A month ago my friend and I have been in casa del mar, for her birthday   I think The location is perfect, and the hotel is very tiny. The girls are lovely and always available. They also borrowed us their bycicles for an whole day. The breakfast is the best to start a nice and energetic day in here!! Everything absolutely beautiful"
"Thank you again for your hospitaly and all your help. It was really nice to meet you girls. We had a really good moment there. Amaizing breakfast, You can’t imagine better! REALLY! You should go there if you staying at Isla Mujeres, and if it’s full, she have friends with other places  "
" umbrella.    The food at the hotel was very good. We thought it was a bit pricey the first night, but we soon learned that the restaurants in Tulum were more expensive than most others in nearby cities like Cancun.  But, all of our meals were very good. We were very impressed by the included continental breakfast each morning with fresh bread, croissants, fruit, butter, jam, juices and coffee. You can order more, but this was enough for us knowing we would be eating decadently the rest of the day in Tulum."
"We’ve been to Mexico multiple times but never to to Tulum. This was an unforgettable experience. Akkuun Hotel was the perfect stop to stay at. The service at the hotel was great. Santos at the beach restaurant was very attentive from the first day and Carlson from the reception made sure we had everything needed for a great stay. Can’t thank enough the staff for the excellent service,  compliment the owners for the exquisite taste in decor and hospitality, and admire the natural beauty of Tulum. We will def"
"We absolutely LOVED this hotel.   All areas were spotless and constantly cleaned, staff was wonderful, the decor is beautiful and everything felt very new.   The rooms are spacious and comfortable with everything you need. We had a small living room which was nice and a small balcony overlooking the front street. The entire Zama area was still developing so at the time of our stay it was tranquil with stunning views of the surrounding jungle.   The rooftop restaurant was convenient to have breakfast and din"

"Gracias Sue y Miguel.  We found this place by accident as we were without a place to stay our last week on Isla.  Sue and Miguel met us and showed us the apartment and we rented it for 6 nights.  The apartment is huge with a large livingroom, kitchen and bedroom.  The rooms are kept clean and sparkeling.  When we had a little issue with the microwave it was replaced almost immediately.  The neighborhood was wonderful and relaxing and sitting on the patio watching the children at the kindergarten while havin"
"Sometimes, it’s just not the place but the customer service that makes a great vacation. I originally had an Airbnb booked for my birthday trip with 5 of my friends, but I needed the ease and convenience of being beach side and all of the amenities, but not go over budget.  I also didn’t want to book 2 different rooms for my small group. I was excited to find Zamas Hotel.  I was happy to book their Coconut Grove Grande to fit all 6 of us in one cute cabana that overlooked coconut groves and literally steps "
This house is nothing short of amazing. Infiniti pool. Ocean front. Huge kitchen. Restaurant next door. Everything was perfect.we had 5 couples here for a week. We rented golf carts and drove all over the island. The house was st the quiet end of the island.
Visited today for a lovely trip and came across this place. Great Nachos and a superb chicken Caesar salad. Friendly staff and very quick service. Lovely beach setting where there are many boats visiting.
"Great location in the center of the action. The room was really nice and clean. Had everything you need. Close to many restaurants, bars, beaches, event center etc. Rob was easy to deal with and very helpful. Marie was great and very kind person. Thanks guys!"
"A nice location close to the center, the atmosphere was peacefully and the owners are very friendly! They have been always helpful during our visit. They let us use their bycicles whenever we wanted. The breakfast was just delicious, full of beautiful choises. The rooms are cleaned and comfortables. We really enjoyed our time in Casa del mar!"

Perfect place to unwind and disconnect for a romantic getaway with your better half for a birthday celebration!!! The staff of the entire hotel is just awesome - very very helpful every step of the way!!! Management at the frontdesk makes you feel welcome and will help you with suggestions of places to visit and rental of the transportation of any kind you prefer from bicycles and scooters to cars! And make sure to come see Santos on the beach!!!
 heavily on our car to get in and out of the neighborhood daily in order to visit Pueblo and surrounding areas.   We loved this boutique hotel and highly recommend!

The apartment was very clean, and fully stocked with everything one would need. The space was large and comfortable, and so were the beds!

The best part was that they helped me arrange tours with local contractors to Chitzen Itsa, Cenotes, Sian Kaan, and  even arranged the booking of group massages on the morning of my birthday.  They even arranged for our shuttle pickup and Covid tests before we left. Read the info about the hotel. You will not get a typical American continental breakfast.

Rob called us as we booked and we chatted for about half an hour about the island, giving us a great sense of welcome, then his cousin Marie greeted us upon our arrival and drove us around the island by golf cart, showing us everything (including a statue of her grandfather!) and even took us to the supermarket to pick up items.   The house itself couldn't be more central to town and we were"

We feel in our casa on the beach at Casa Violeta thanks to the wonderful staff which feels like a big family from Karla (the stunning and stylish owner), Giampierro (GM), Alex (the famous italian chef from Florence), Carlo (at the reception) and the entire staff as well as  the customers who keep returning.   The italien food is out of this world, like if you were in a restaurant in Italy with extraordinary al dente pasta, thin crust pizza, delicious veggies and daily specials.  A d"

 We booked to stay for 3 nights and ended up staying 3 weeks in the Luna studio! Sorry this is a long one but I feel like we need to do this incredible place justice.  This great studio has a decent size bathroom and a kitchen equipped with everything you need.  My husband and i had been staying in a hotel in playa del Carmen and were really looking forward to home cooked meals which was so easy while staying at Capi's. There is a huge supermarket a 15 minute walk away or 15-20 peso taxi ride. A smaller sup

"Very chic, new and modern hotel in the newly Aldea Zama neighborhood which is a modern mix where tropical and city meet. For starters the hotel is located in a new section of Tulum that’s “heavily” under construction. If you can see pass the construction you’ll be fine, if construction bothers you stay away. If you’re looking for beach access stay away. The beach is about 10 minutes (taxi), 35 minutes bike, or an hour walk. Speaking of bikes the hotel has them for free to use, which is a nice perk. The hote"

Great time ... great boat ride w plenty of excitement. Able to snorkel on ur way back crystal clear warm waters ok food ... great location for plenty of beautiful pictures !!! Staff is not pushy which is great
There was eight of us and we enjoyed the house and beach. We stayed four nights and had the best time with our friends. I would tell anyone who wants to relax this is the place to do so. We rented it though Luxury Retreats.
"Cute little apartment in the heart of the town.  The rooms are clean and you feel like you are living on the island.  Just a short walking distance from the ferry and surrounded by a variety of restaurants, bars, tour offices, and markets.  My favorite part of our stay was having coffee outside on the patio every morning, that and the walk on the beach just a block or so away."

"We had a very enjoyable family vacation on Isla Mujeres with 9 of us staying at Casa de La Playa.  Location  Located on Sac Bajo (a little peninsula on the west side of the island). About 100 peso taxi ride from the ferry port. Pretty view of Cancun at night. Being on this side of the island, the water is calmer. I'd recommend renting a golf cart for the freedom/convenience, but taxis do seem to be relatively plentiful in the area. There's a beach club, ""Ice Bar,"" a place that sells chilled coconuts, a hote"

"We rented the whole hotel for 2 nights for family and friends while we had our wedding in Tulum. Carla and Giampiero were super helpful on the lead up to us travelling from the USA and helped with all our questions and needs.  Giampiero and all the staff were very nice and accommodating for our big group.  My wife and I stayed in the largest room, Magnolia.

"Good showers and comfy beds. WIFI is good as are the showers and AC. A short walk to all the action and diners. A good supermarket nearby and 2 cheap fast food shops. A short walk to the main beach then get the bus back for 2 euros, they run every half hour both ways. "
"We have been staying at Maria Leticia for the past 14 years. Nivaldo and Daniella are wonderful. There are a variety of rooms, some with singles other with doubles. Very basic but clean and safe. The courtyard is lovely to sit in the morning with a coffee or the evening with other guests."
"My granddaughter and I recently stayed at Capi's.  This was a beautiful, large, breezy apartment.  There was ample room and the place was well-equipped.  A complete kitchen made it easy to cook the local cuisine.  One of our favorite spots in this apartment was the second floor patio area.  It was such a treat to enjoy a cup of morning coffee with the sights and sounds of the neighborhood. Late evenings meant resting in the hammock and watching local cable TV.  We were so comfortable at Capi's, it immediate"
" relaxing or playing games. House has an assortment of beach games/toys. They even comb it every morning which was nice. The downside to us was the water. Super squishy with seaweed or whatever is growing there. Water socks help a bit, but not that much. It just felt weird being in it. When we wanted water, we ended up going to the Zama beach club a short walk up the road. Mexico doesn't seem too stringent when it comes to protecting seaweed so it seems like an opportunity to clean it up and make it nice.  "
"I reserved and paid for 6 nights since july via despegar.com. When I arrived to the place it was very crowded,  full of local families, the service is expensive and bad. The new manager did not respect my reservation because she said they are working in an independent fashion, so I lost my money and had to pay for another hotel. Don't go there it is not worth anymore."
To start we booked with Sidney Morris and he has since turned over ownership and operations to his son Rob and his Daughter Karen. We arrived Sidney was a very gracious host. He introduced us to home living on Isla as opposed to the standard hotel accommodations most of us are used to. It was at first somewhat dawnting but after a couple of days with Sid's help we settled right in. Casa    Isleno is inn a very good location in Centro. Around the corner from the Zocolo (city square) where there was a grocery

"Great budget room, super clean, comfortable, and has everything you'll need (a/c, fridge..) Stayed four nights and loved the spacious room and the friendly and helpful owners.   Best value for money in town!  "
"Very clean and comfortable. Loved my room. It was large, with 2 double beds; a kitchenette with a small fridge, microwave, hot plate, cutlery, etc.; ample storage space; great AC; more than adequate hot water (I had trouble getting water cold enough for a cold shower after a hot day); and a tiny balcony that overlooked the interior courtyard. It is a block from the main drag (a bonus!) so the room was quiet and a block or so from the beach. On the negative side I was only able to get an internet connection "

"This is one of my favorite places on Earth. I've stayed at every house/condo/apartment Punta Piedra has to offer & I've never been disappointed. The location on the island is absolutely perfect, the property/rooms are clean, not only stocked well but stocked thoughtfully to make sure you're comfortable & simple enough to meet your needs without taking away from the beauty of the beach. Don't miss the sunrises - they are breath-taking & definitely worth waking up early to see!"

"A great place to stay in cabanas direcly on the beach at Isla Blanca! Each cabana has its own hammock in front of the cabana to relax in after a sunny day on the beach. Be sure to bring a flash lite, cause the place get its electrical power from a diesel generator that is put out during the night."
"This is not on Isla Mujeres, it is on the mainland, 20 miles or so north of Cancun. However, it looks like it was flattened by a hurricane and never rebuilt. I booked a cabana, thinking it was on Isla Mujeres, then couldn't find any way to contact the owner to cancel so I left the island and tried to find this place. After a very expensive cab ride, we found the entrance to this place, but it was seriously scary looking and appeared abandoned. Additionally, there was a large hotel under construction nearby "
"This was our second trip to Isla and our second time staying at Zina's.  What an amazing host in an incredibly convenient location (La Gloria) for families!  Close to a really terrific and well supervised playground, a bunch of local eatery/restaurants and shops, even a grocery store and an open-air market (don't miss the tortillaria on the corner) all make this a wonderful place for folks with small kids to enjoy a vacation.  Our son (6 yo) loves coming to Zina's where he can play card games or gaze up at "
" because of all of the above and the airiness. Bring a towel for the beach if you use one as the towels are almost transparent and it is specified that they are not to be brought to the beach. (I brought a wash cloth which, with the sun/heat, was more than adequate to dry off.)  Nibardo, the owner, was accommodating but it would have been nice to see an occasional smile."

"Stayed for 6 nights, whole house for a girls trip and plan to come back in July with kids.  So many great things to say!  1) Location - perfect for us!  Mid island and half way to everywhere, we walked downtown (20 minutes), Mango Cafe (5 minutes), Mike’s Pizza (6 minutes), Madera Food and Art (15 minutes maybe.). DaLuisa restaurant is next door and really fabulous - we ate there twice.  We did have a golf cart and really found it convenient and fun to go all around the island.  Cabs were also very easy out"
"Third stay at this property.  The location right on the water cannot be beat.  To hear and smell the ocean breeze all day and all night is a real treat. This is a simple, clean accommodation not for those seeking luxury but perfect for experiencing the real Isla."

We found this place by hasard and ""after buts and doubts"" we appeared at Roberto's (the faboulous owner) last piece of paradise.

 coffee waited for us at the outside private table of our cabana.  What else a soul can ask??  Roberto and Carlos smiles were not charged in the invoice.... or we could have been broken after an unforgettable week at the Paradise....called Pirata Morgan!
" The kitchen has just what a family on the go needs to fix healthy and satisfying meals.  The simply equipped kitchen means you can prepare your open-air market food quickly and get on your way.  Your host, Zina, is a wellspring of knowledge about this island she clearly loves, and it is obvious that she has made many great friends in her adopted home. She will introduce you to the best places to watch the sun rise, the easiest beaches for families with kids, and the most amazing food on the island.  She ca"
"We have stayed at Maria Leticia several times and are headed Isla Mujeres next week.  Maria Leticia doesn't have their own website and it was evening, so I went on tripadvisor to make a reservation at Maria Leticia and was redirected to the Despegar website, where they indicated a room was available for our dates.  This was great news because there doesn't seem to be a room left on the island. While I received a confirmation from Despegar, stating that I could just show up at the hotel and pay at that time,"
 house and Marcella who met us to let us in and did our pre grocery shopping for only a $15 fee plus tip.  Great to get off the plane and have some chips and wine waiting for us! 3) house itself - what a great set up for the price!  I did tons of research on house options and for the money lt definitely was the best bang for our buck.  The iguanas by the pool love fruit and cut up canned vegetables but our most favorite was a local stray cat who appears to have adopted the home... he was so much company and
"This is for Punta Piedra 2 lower unit.   The studio was perfect for my needs. It was super clean, well stocked, completely comfortable at a great location. The beach while not swimable is great for walking along and collecting seaglass and shells. The pool was awesome for chilling while listening to crashing waves. Amy the owner was lovely and accommodating. Checking every day to make sure I was ok. Amy’s gorgeous dogs came over to socialize every morning so I had canine companionship. The bed was very comf"
"Great place, clean, near everything downtown. We practically had the pool to ourselves.  You can access the malecon and it is generally quiet. Would definitely stay again. Also we were able to park our golf cart in an empty lot next door. Mainly watched Netflix on the TV at night. Also coffee was provided which is great for the first day waking up,"

"My family and I stayed at Punta Piedra June 20 for 7 nights. We rented all 5 units. The units were clean, Pool was cool, Beach access was amazing. pictures on site are accurate, We took Taxis the first 2 days for about 50 peso then rented scooters the last 5 days. Amy and Louis were great hosts. We will be back for sure,"
"I stayed at the Xalapa room. The view is the most beautiful both during the day and at night because you see the sunrise and the moon is reflected in the sea, which is the glory. Super spotless, clean, good smell. I would stay a thousand times more in this place. The pool is small but enough for my children to play. The pool is shared with others in the village but there was never anyone so we only used it ourselves. He had coffee, microwave, drinking water. That little house is really a beauty. The decorat"
"I loved the upstairs apartment here.  Had all the amenities that one would need.  My host Zina was informed that I am a vegetarian and had me wonderful fruits, nuts and 3 beers awaiting my arrival.  I loved the fact that it is located in a mexican neighborhood.  I could walk to the market for fresh juice, go to the supermarket for food.  Taxi was easy to get as you just have to walk out the door, there are beaches in walking distance.  Maid service was prompt.  I love that I could walk out the door and have"

"Casa Luna Turquesa is a wonderful mid-island oceanfront home.  There is a spectacular ocean view, the sound of the waves rolling in makes it the ideal place to just let all your stress fade away!  Away from the crowds of Centro but an easy walking distance to several restaurants and shopping. Richard and Linda, the owners, have provided every thing you need for a comfortable stay. They are wonderful hosts! There are sitting spaces both on the ocean side and the street side, so no matter what the weather, th"
Food and staff excellent.   Raw sewing leaking to out side properties was disgusting.  The leadership references to to the local people was/is disgusting.   This is no longer Juan Carrillo's leadership people.
"This was our second stay at Punta Piedra and our first at Punta Piedra 2.  We stayed in the lower unit for a week and it was wonderful.  The location, right on the water, can't be beat.  Waking up to a beautiful sunshine and enjoying a refreshing ocean breeze all day long was wonderful.  While this isn't the best location for swimming, you can walk along the beach, find sea glass and shells, and wade in the water.  Also, Playa Norte and its beautiful beaches are a 20 minute walk away.   If you are high main"
"My husband and I just spent 4 nights at Punta Piedra II.  Amy and Louis were very helpful hosts looking after all our needs.  The room is clean, spacious and has everything you need.   The king size bed was comfortable.   The kitchen equipped with everything you need. It is less than a 30 minute walk to Playa Norte and there are several good restaurants within 15 minutes walk to the south.  We would stay here again. "

"We stayed in Villa Cozumel for a week in January 2021 - COVID times.  The villas was spotless and we couldn't have been more pleased with how clean it was and everything was in great condition.  You can tell they take care of their property and it showed in Cozumel.   The villa is on the 3rd floor with only stair access.  It has THE MOST amazing views from the balcony off of the room.  The balcony was pretty windy, but not cold.  We were told by a local that it's the trade winds or time of year, but we stil"
" Living area was comfortable with two couches (futons maybe?) and a 4 person table.  One tv in the villa and that was in the living area.  this area also had a ceiling fan. bathroom had numerous towels, hair dryer and was spacious.  the shower head left a lot to be desired and would be the only thing I would say wasn't up to par.   bedroom had a ceiling fan and it's own A/C unit, no tv.  the bed was very comfy too. Plenty of places to plug in and charge electronics. Two pools - we only used the one closest "
"We originally had reservations to stay at an apartment mid-island, but unfortunately there was a booking mistake and our apartment was not available.  The owner checked around to find us another place to stay and we were told that there was space available at Zina's Guest House. Because of the fact that it was high season and we were looking for last minute accommodations, we decided that we would give it a try.  To begin with, Zina was most hospitable.  There was fresh bread and some supplies in the fridge"
"We had a wonderful time in Casa Luna Turquesa. The house had everthing we needed and the location was perfect, right on the water and a great pool to swim in.Really loved the palapa for our morning coffee and evening cocktails. Large supermarket a few blocks away for all our grocery and beverages.Good restaurants fairly close and the downtown area is a pleasant 20 minute walk. Would definitely return."
"We spent the week before Christmas at Casa Luna Turquesa. Wonderful time to be on the island and staying at this most amazing centrally located property. Dont worry that there is no address, just tell the taxi driver the name of the house and it is across from the school (literally 5 minutes from ferry.) The home is on the Caribbean side, so you have constant wind and waves, which keep you cool and fresh. As we visited the other areas, we really appreciated  returning to it's location. You are steps to neig"
We spent several days in the Penthouse suite and really enjoyed it. Very nice space with huge bath and dressing area. There was a porch that we used every night that overlooks the bar and the ocean. Do be aware that there are quite a few steps so it is not handicap accessible. That's just an fyi.
"This review is actually for Punta Piedra II, the upper level. We rented it from 10/12/16 to 10/26/16. Same property, but it is the south building.   Our first day we had a bit of a problem, but we discussed it with Amy, and it was resolved immediately, so I won't discuss it further. She took care of business, and actually did way more than she needed to.   Overall, PP II was exactly what we were looking for: our own quiet little place right on the ocean that we could call ""our own"" (for a few days). We both"

A gorgeous villa style apartment.. beautifully equipped...balcony overlooking the Malecon..we stayed in Campeche.

" sheets"".  The sheets on the double bed were indeed Egyptian cotton, although probably 10 years old and had seen much better days.  When the sheets were changed after 7 days, the next ones were labeled ""Polyester - made in Pakistan"".  The second bed in the room, a twin bed, had no sheets on it when we arrived.  I found one sheet in a box in the kitchen and put it on the bed myself.  The bedroom has 3 windows.  Two of the windows have heavy curtains, but the third window, the largest one, has only a nylon ca"
" beat not having to drive. The neighbors are fantastic and friendly, giving us the sense we were home away from home. We had five adults in our group and there was plenty of room in and outside.  You cannot go wrong booking this home from Richard and his wife. Cheers and enjoy."
Stayed here for a week in October in the Penthouse suite. Glorious- the guest house piece might be the best kept secret on the island. Room is beautiful and being steps away from the strongest margaritas on planet earth didn't hurt either. Mal and Sally are amazing hosts and the bar staff are the kindest group of people around. Poncho the Iguana is the greatest lizard around and the sunsets are spectacular!
" cozy, and in their own way feel like a home away from home.   This side of the island isn't good for snorkeling (at least in October), but we knew that going in so that was not a detractor. And from this location, you can reach the best beaches on the island by taxi in 5 minutes for $4 US (or you can rent a golf cart for your stay, like we did... we rented from Prisma... but that's another review...). What you get instead is some clean views of the ocean, some wonderful waves, and the (almost) unmolested s"
"I selfishly don't want to write this review so I can keep this place a secret. This was my first time on Isla Mujeres and it was without a doubt the loveliest vacation I've ever been on. Staying at La Vida Dulce with Steve and Jeri as casita hosts made it that much more incredible. I felt like I was at home. The people, the food, the conversations - time slowed down and I can't help but reminisce on the wonderful memories made over my stay, which I ended up extending an additional two days ;) When I come ba"

Walking distance from few restaurants but to have the best time, just rent a scooter and you'll have the best of both world, which is access to all the island without relying on taxi and a nice quiet and clean place to sleep. Oh! and the breakfast : fresh fruits and pastry every morning! Just perfect before a day at"

The pools were handy, but unfortunately I wasn't able to use due to no ladders which I dearly missed! I have 2knee replacements. I also recommend a railing on The walkway stairs out front to the ocean. The cleaning crew and staff where very good! I will return! Isladreams.Com"

"Off the sidewalk, up an alley and around the corner and you arrive at the coolest bar on Isla Mujeres. Home of the best margarita anywhere, the Soggy Peso is authentic Mexico-Caribbean beach casual. Linger over drinks and attach a souvenir to any space you can find while just chilling out. Take a few minutes or a few hours to get in the mood and you won’t regret it!"

"We stayed 8 days at casa arriba (2 bedrooms apartment in punta piedra) with my 1 1/2 year old son and husband. I have good points and bad points too to review unfortunately :( The apartment is clean, not very modern but the price is not that high so no complaint. The owner of the place, named Amy, is a really good and nice person.  The person that is taking care of the apartment for her is not very helpful, especially before the booking. Not willing to help, very short on explanation whereas it was our firs"
"The owners live right there.  The front gate locks at night, you will have the key.  You can feel very secure.  The t v has English channels, so on a rainy day, all the creature comforts!   Everything is provided, linens, paper products,  coffee pot, microwave and small fridge. "
"We really enjoyed our stay at Casa Onali. Our host Jazz was very kind and helpful and his dining recommendations were spot on. The location is quiet but within walking distance of many restaurants, bars and beaches. The boho styled room was spacious with lots of storage space and the bed very comfortable. The shower was nice as well with plenty of hot water and pressure and the air conditioner worked very well.  Jazz prepared for us fresh fruits and pastries every morning with the best coffee we have had an"
"A truly amazing place to stay!  Palenque is on the ground level and just across the Malecon from the ocean.  Beautiful view of the ocean from the balcony!  Villa San Miguel is close to everything...a small grocery store just around the corner, a short walk from the ferry, close to Playa Norte and close to great shopping and restaurants.  The owner is quick to respond to all questions and the staff are friendly and accommodating.  We had friends in 3 other units and they were all lovely places to stay."
"My husband and I recently stayed for a week at Villa San Miguel in the Veracruz villa. To say it was wonderful is an understatement! It was very clean, quiet, and spacious. The location was incredible - a short walk to the ferry, to the downtown restaurants, and to the beach.  There is also a local grocery store (incredibly inexpensive) around the corner and we purchased groceries, wine, and needed supplies there.   We stayed in the Veracruz villa and I would absolutely recommend trying to get that villa. I"
"I spent almost a month at Zina's. I loved the little apartment and roof patio, where I would have my morning coffee and watch the world of la gloria going on around me. The apartment was clean and welcoming when I arrived. There were basic provisions in the kitchen, cold beer, milk, and condiments. Coffee and tea were also provided. Books, magazines and wireless. Toward the end of my stay a friend joined me, and we moved the single bed into the 2nd room to give us both some privacy. The pictures on the webs"
"Our family has stayed many times at Casa Luna Turquesa. We love the house and have always felt very safe there. As children and now teenagers our kids love the large pool and the location. This last stay was in the summer so the highlight of our trip was watching the giant sea turtles come up onto the beach to lay their eggs at night. We also swam with the whale sharks and went scuba diving on the reefs, which was amazing!  The house itself offers lots of room and privacy for family and friends vacationing "
"This is a MUST stop of the island.  We’ve been coming to Isla for about 9 years and always come to soggy peso.  The food is always great, margaritas are stiff and delicious and always had wonderful service.  Even have stopped here with our small kids and although it says no kids they have always been more than happy to accommodate us. The fajitas are amazing but honestly hadn’t ever had anything but good food here."
"We booked and confirmed a table for 15 on Thursday. We arrived and spent 11500 pesos there. We had an average burger, and average service. However, we then received abusive, threatening and aggressive email on the Friday night as we allegedly hasn't turned up for our table. The owner had the wrong dates and rather than apologise to us (it also happened to be our wedding night he sent the email threatening us to leave the island) he continued his barrage of abuse.   Considering the man has taken advantage of"
"LVD is centrally located - beach, restaurants/bars stones throw away!  The rooftop palapa provides a cool spot for game playing, cocktailing or outdoor dining. Jeri & Steve are great hosts, providing advice and insight on what to do/not do on Isla.  This trip we had two teen boys and unit #3 was perfect.  Adults and kids had their own space and the kitchen was great for dining in/snacking/etc.  We've stayed at LVD many times and they never disappoint!  Free ice, bottled water and US/CAN calls are icing on t"
"Casa Onali was wonderful. Tucked away in a quiet area if that's what you're looking for, but getting around the island was easy with a scooter. Jazz was a superb host, from helpful tips (like the scooter) to excellent coffee and fun conversation. We'd absolutely come back next time we're on the island."
 everything on the North side of the island that we only rented one for a day to explore the South side. There is a place right next door to the villa if needed.   We will absolutely be back!
" Funnily enough we are still on the island and every other restaurant has gladly served our group of over 40 people, so I guess his threats of us needing to leave the island are laughably empty.  I think the owners character is demonstrable by his replies to any criticism on his trip advisor feed, so beware."
"We stay here every time we go to Isla. Steve and Jeri are great. The rooms are clean and well kept. They have beach chairs and some snorkel gear that you can borrow. The palapa is nice for sitting and reading. Everything you need for your stay. We've stayed in all of their rooms and had no complaints. This is in the downtown district and walking distance to stores, restaurants and the beach. Excellent location"
I made appoint to eat at the best places in Cancun.  Its been a few years since I ate here but it still is the best Italian food and maybe the best overall restaurant in Cancun.  It is a small place with great service and great food at a good price.    We went as a family with my 2 teenage daughters and my 22 year daughter and her boyfriend.  It gave them a chance to wear their nice dresses and have a nice night out at a slightly upscale place.  You can still dress very casual but its not the surfin burrito

"I really like to give a realistic picture of a rental, not being overly critical, because you can always find fault.  However, painting an overly rosy picture doesn't help other travelers, so I would like to give the pros and cons: Pros: beautiful, large room.  well-decorated and you can tell the owners spent a lot to make these penthouses really nice.  Great food.  The tacos and guacamole were very good.   The drinks were knock-you-out strong.  One frequent island visitor described the bar as one where the"
Stayed here and loved the location. Across the road from one beach and 5 minutes from Playa Norte.  2 blocks from Hidalgo.  Hot tub on the balcony in this unit.  Spacious and comfortable.  And it came with beach chairs and an umbrella! The only suggestion I would have is to not use scented products in the laundry.
"November was our 3rd stay at La Vida Dulce. We have stayed in unit 1 & unit 2 Both have absolutely everything we need including a ton of room  Super clean ( they have a great lady who comes in as little or much as you want) & she does great job Owners Jeri & Steve are great! Have so much knowledge of the island , open , friendly accommodating  They were celebrating US thanksgiving when we were there & they invited us to a dinner they host every year up on the rooftop deck Just did a stop by and very impress"

"I went to Casa Onali with my sister in May. The host was extremely pleasant and welcoming and the the house is just amazing. The rooms are spacious and comfy, breakfast was served even though it wasn't in our booking. The host was so nice that he picked us up at the ferry point and dropped us there when we left, he even changed money for us. I would highly recommend as everything went smoothly and our stay there was perfect. Thanks again!"
"Visiting Isla Mujeres for the first 3 days of our two week Mexico vacation was a bonus at Casa Onali. The rooms were large and welcoming. Right beside a lagoon with a pleasant 2km walk around it, which we did several times. Jass picked us up from the ferry which was so nice after a long day travelling. He also gave us many suggestions, advice and recommendations on what to do, where to go, and where to eat while there. Enjoyed the fruit and coffee every morning.  Ramses welcomed us each time we came home. H"

We had a great ocean breeze most days, and could see the water through the palm trees.The maid service was great, and the staff were friendly and attentive, especially Daniel.  Cons: when we arrived, I noticed a pretty strong, unpleasant odor.  Since the owner came up with us to show us around, I didn't say anything, as he had to also notice it. I thought perhaps it was temporary and would go away with the windows open.  It lingered for 4 days. I could smell it at nig"
"We recently stayed at Color de Verano for 2 1/2 weeks.  This has turned into being our go-to-place when staying on the island.  Teresa is such a great person to know.  She has a kind heart.  We stayed in Studio Apt. #1 for the first 3 nights prior to moving up to Apt. #2.  Color de Verano is in a great location while being close to Playa Centro and Playa Norte.

"I stayed in the penthouse apartment for one month during late October and November 2020. The views from the penthouse are second to none. The apartment is very well designed and has everything you need for a long stay - including cooking the majority of your meals if you choose. There is also plenty of storage space for long term renters. Teresa, the owner, is an excellent host and very accessible. The daily staff is great and does a terrific job of cleaning. Wifi was good to support working remotely and st"

Great location near main business lane and playa norte. Hosts live onsite and were available for any questions but not overbearing. Air conditioning worked well. Kitchenettes had all we needed as we made our own breakfasts daily. We will definitely be returning there.
"We had the most amazing week at Casa Flamboyan! It is in the perfect location on Isla Mujeres - halfway between the northern downtown area and the more local southern neighborhood. You can easily walk to all of the restaurants and shops on the northern end, but we rented a golf cart for the week and it made getting around effortless. Plus, it was fun! The rooms are spacious and were so clean when we arrived, you could probably have eaten off the floor. The room setup with multiple outdoor porches and kitche"
"‘Perfect location’  ➖ Nothing. Seriously, nothing.  ➕ Casa Onali is a beautiful little building overlooking the lagoon and boardwalk. The suite was spacious, bright and airy, and very nicely decorated. The bedroom with en-suite was very comfortable with tons of storage and good a/c when you need it. The location was perfect-both the north and south points were only a 15 minute bike ride each way. The free use of a bicycle was a big bonus for me, as a solo traveller who likes to explore more than just the be"
"Our experience here at Casa Roca Caribe was exceptional. As soon as you walk in the door, the blue Caribbean Sea is right there in front of you. (See photo) Communication with the homeowners was great. My emails were answered promptly. If you book here, they will provide all of the information you will need to plan your trip.  The house is on a private dead end street, and is within steps to the local Catholic Church, a small corner grocery, and Mango Cafe. We felt very safe walking through the neighborhood"
"This place was perfect for my boyfriend and I. Teresa is so kind and accommodating. We were welcomed by a bottle of wine and our room was very clean. The air conditioning was cold, the shower was hot, and we received fresh towels every day. We can’t wait to stay here again. "
"This is our eighth year staying with Teresa and we love it! This is truly our home for the holidays and we wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. The apartment has the perfect space and amenities, the location is perfect, and Teresa takes such good care of us. We love our Isla home!"
"My sisters/aunt and uncle all have stayed and loved this little casita.  Although I have visited many times I have never stayed. This two week visit I decided to stay in Suite 1 with my sister and bro in law in Suite 2. Loved it!!   Tastefully decorated, well equipped kitchen, comfy bed and a nice hot shower.   Suite 1 is next to the street.  Busy during the day but is very quiet at night.   The roof top palapa has a large table, outdoor seating area and dipping pool. This casita provides drinking water, be"
"Our stay at Casa Flamboyan was from Nov 29 to Dec 13. We were fortunate enough to stay in both rental units over that time. Both units are immaculate and well laid out, everything we needed was there even snacks for late arrivals - salsa, frijoles, chips, some eggs, butter, coffee, and sugar. Bathroom products (soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion) are very nice quality as well. The wifi is good but may not be fast enough for some - I worked as well over this vacation and was only minorly frustrated over slow"

The master also has a water view. Very clean throughout! The view here is just spectacular. You’ll have a hard time leaving the balcony!  Don’t hesitate to book this property! We felt like family staying here, and plan on coming back for years to come."

It has a large balcony, kitchen with full-size refrigerator, living room with couch and chairs, bedroom, and bathroom.  There is ample room to store your clothes and essentials.  There are hangers in the closet in the bathroom along with a safe and a bin for laundry.  You really can't beat this place.  The only draw back for some people might be "

Chedraui is a 20 minute walk away. Coco Jaguar about 15 min stroll  in Salina Chica. Sidewalks in not bad shape. Bus runs past the house at least hourly but times are difficult to predict, it's better to take the bus on the way back. We didn't find the traffic noisy - front door is almost soundproof.

Casa Roca Caribe is a great place to stay and overlooks the ocean. It is beautiful and clean. Lorenzo and Lydia take great care of you!! It is close to good restaurants and can even get pizza delivery. You won't want to leave!
"Best stay on the Island. Karen and Jimbo go above and beyond to provide a beautiful and cozy getaway in the midst of the local community. Communication is superb and their website full of helpful info. There house staff is friendly and at your service. Our favorite drinks were waiting, fresh towels were brought before we even asked, bikes were a nice addition and Lorenzo brought us fresh squeezed Island Orange juice. Always fun and so private and quiet. Will return again next year. "
" people in their reviews commented about the noise.  You do hear cars going by early in the morning, but it is not bad.  We did hear some rowdy people in front of PA one night, but they were arrested and taken away!  I really do not feel noise was an issue.  Plus, I like to get up early and go hunting for sea glass!"

"Great value for the spot -- it couldn't have been better for my sister and me and our two teenage daughters. We had lots of privacy, and the view is absolutely perfect.  Lorenzo is a great host, and there were a few really good restaurants close by. "
"We have just returned from Isla and miss listening to the ocean. The Casa is exactly as pictured online. Authentic Mexican decor right at the waters edge. This unit  is in a neighborhood in the center of the island. I have stayed in the south end in the past and prefer this location. We rented a golf cart for 6 of our 10 days and found it easy to walk, use the Casa’s bikes or taxis on the days we did not have a cart. Restaurants and the main grocery store are an easy walk. The local staff were amazing and o"

We always have an excellent time at Casa Flamboyan!  The rooms are always sparkling clean and kept up throughout the week. Lupi checked on us everyday to see if we needed anything.  Convenient location! Loved the watch the sunrise every morning and walk looking for sea glass!
"The view and the sound of the ocean was therapy. Went back home full of energy.The commodity of the house makes you feel like you are at home. The apartment is directly on the ocean with a big jacuzzi on the balcony. There are bicycles available for transportation (the island is small so you can go from one end to the other by bike). There is a major grocery store nearby if you feel like staying in and cooking in your fully equipped kitchen. Lots of restaurants nearby. If needed, help was just a phone call "
"We spent a week and a half in Isla and stayed at Karen and Jimbos for the majority of the time and it was a fantastic experience. What I loved most about this place was that it was away from the touristy areas. Nicely appointed, it was nestled on a cul-de-sac surrounded by locals and right on the rocky beach. We spent a lot of our time exploring the rocks and just relaxing. Would 100% recommend and do it again."
"We stayed in Apartment #2 for nearly 3 weeks and can't wait to go back.  We have stayed at several places on the north end in the past.  Theresa met us when we arrived.  She had cool towels and a bottle of wine for us.  What a great host!  The kitchen is connected to the living room with a divider that includes stools.  The kitchen has a full-size refrigerator, small electric stove, coffee maker with good coffee, glasses, utensils, microwave, and a large container of water.  There was a bag of ice in the fr"

Also salt, pepper, sugar, coffee, filters, 5 gal jug of purified water, small ice chest, beach chairs, nice smooth bed sheets(rare in Mexico), fluffy white freshly-bleached towels and wash-clothes, "

"  There is a microwave, refrigerator/freezer, and 4 burner gas stove.   I normally buy a bag of ice but the store was out, so maybe ice trays would have been nice but with it being cool out, they weren’t a necessity.  So basically bring clothes and you are good to go.  Lupe, the house manager, met us on arrival and showed us around.  Her English is very good.  There is also an informational book in the apt. with house info and restaurant suggestions.  The king bed is very firm which is typical of Mexico but"

"We have been coming to Isla Mujeres for many years and always  try different accomodations to change up our experience. Casa Flamboyan did not disappoint! We chose ""Real"" which we found to be beautiful and spacious. The unit was very well stocked with everything we needed and the house keeper Lupe was most pleasant and accommodating. We enjoyed the views from the rooftop as well as the fabulous vistas from the ocean side terrance and front balcony.  We had the entire place to ourselves and certainly enjoyed"
 to find a less crowded area each day where we could have our own shaddy space under a tree!  Casa Flamboyan was perfect for our needs and we are so happy we chose it!
"We have been to the island 7 times, and have stayed with Lolo all 7 times!  We love her unique rooms and style, and her breakfasts are beyond amazing!  The honeymoon suite opens to a private pool and oasis, perfect for relaxing in the afternoon. We enjoy staying mid island, and it is very close to Chedraui, Mango Cafe and several resturants. We will be back!!"
"I came to Lolo with my Goddaughter Maya and her boyfriend.Lolo gave us half of a villa ( 2 large bedrooms) for the price of one. She created vacation of a lifetime for all 3 of us. Lolo is a wonderful person and she has adorable son and niece and a dog and cats. Lolo is a great Chef and she cooked for us often even though it was not in a contract. The best place on earth for a family vacation. If you don't have a family, they will become one."
"This is a tasteful decorated small hotel right on the beach. It is very well designed, so despite the hotel being on a small plot it maximise space. The pool starts almost as soon as you walk in and continues to the beach. Very clever. Stylish comfortable furniture and beds. Chic bar area. The best breakfast I’ve ever had, served to you, freshly prepared. Friendly helpful staff.  Good location, within a short walk to two sister hotels you can also use & dine in.  Two other small hotels and a beach bar withi"
"Lolo and her space are amazing & the breakfast she cooks are delicious.  I came to get away - solo female traveller - and Lolos was perfection.  I rented the Honeymoon Suite and could not have been more pleased; intimate, private, secluded, conveniently located (but, not in the middle of the tourist spots), healing - truly special.  Lolo is easy to talk to and her breakfast were beyond amazing - unique and personal - she asked what i liked and delivered!  Plenty of towels, comfy bed, beautiful pool, incredi"
" from old Tulum, we loved it."
"Great place, quiet, very clean room, lovely sheets  and towels, loved  the owner... I can recommend this B&B without hesitation. It’s the nicest place I saw on the island.  Will definitely come back .....Nicky"
…
"We have stayed with Lolo for the past 5 years. We found her on TA looking under B&B’s and found she also does 5 star dinners and were intrigued. We fell in love with her quaint little place mid island, and feel we get a much more local vibe than the big places downtown. We started out staying 5 days. Now 14 days is not enough!  Also, very peaceful and laid back which we like. We have stayed in the blue room and the honeymoon suite and LOVE the HMS with the sliding doors directly to the pool❤️. And her 2 cou"
Such a beautiful hotel!  We stayed there for 3 nights and totally enjoyed our stay. The breakfast which is included was amazing and very fresh. We also had a fantastic dinner on one evening.  We stayed at a suite with our own private rooftop pool with a great view. The room was always clean and we felt very comfortable.  The beach area is very beautiful and calm. You can also rent a Kayak or Paddleboard for free and also bikes at the reception! :)  We’ve been very sad to leave this amazing place and hope we
"Best words to describe Lolo's place is a home away from home. My husband and I are so glad we decided to rent with Lolo. Her place is located about 5 mnts taxi ride to the North Beach. We rented a golf car and we explored the entire island and ate in a different place every day, but breakfast in the mornings were with Lolo! She delighted us with new things every morning. Lolo as well as her niece Hanna are gifted in the kitchen, they can cook! Lolo is well known and respect it in the island If you ask her s"
"Stayed here with our two young adult daughters for 7 days.  This is the antidote to all the  huge/hipster corporate mega-resorts taking over Quintana Roo. Hotel is tiny (14 rooms) but so incredibly authentic and charming. It's like going back in time 25 years. Staff --special shout-out to Eleonora--are all so kind, personable and thoughtful. Great on-site bar/restaurant (Mivida) serving at palapa looking over beach, and on beach itself.  Would come back in a heartbeat."
The rooms were amazing! Super clean and the hotel grounds were always so peaceful! It literally made you feel like you were living next to a beach and jungle with no distractions. The hotel is also in a  community that has a guard shack that doesn’t just allow anyone; and the grounds have a security guard. The staff was amazing! Isabel Martinez was in charge of the front desk and helped us with any of our needs. She literally made reservations at all the restaurants and clubs we wanted to go so that we neve
"Los Arrecifes was an absolutely gorgeous hotel right on the beach in Tulum. The staff (especially victor) was extremely helpful but there is only a few people so, if you’re looking for that all inclusive resort feel, this isn’t the place for you. But, if you want a place with a beach right in the front and amazing drinks, this is the one! The only downside were that the address was that the gps does not take you to the correct location and there’s no pool. Look for the wooden sign on the left of the road ab"
We chose the tree house. ..my favorite since you have that small terrasse to drink your Coffee and watch the sun rise while everyone else is still asleep. ..wonderfull feeling i'm already missing so much... Great breakfast as allways !
"We had a great experience at Punta Peidra! Friendly staff, great vibe. We stayed in room 21.  Fantastic room overlooking the beach with a large balcony. Very close to good restaurants. Good breakfast included and great Italian food served as well. I would definitely stay here again!"
 back to Tulum I will 100 percent be staying here again! I definitely recommend!
 get much cheaper prices for food and drinks. Very gorgeous place though. No car necessary because you will just take taxis everywhere.
"The hotel is really nice. Design and atmosphere make it a good place to spend some days. Nice swimming pools and good breakfast. Some minor issues to be fixed, but I would recommend it! Internet worked super fast only the first two days, but I think they had a general problem on the area"
"My partner and I stayed with Lolo for a week and felt like family by the end of our trip. We stayed in the blue room which was so cool, filled with details and a beautiful private bathroom with direct access to the stunning pool! Breakfast was service every morning, each dish was delicious and so creative. We always looked forward to what was coming next. The property itself is stunning, so many creative and intentional details around every corner. The staff was beyond accommodating. The neighborhood is a f"
"If you are fortunate enough to visit Isla Mujeres then make sure to include a dinner at Lolo’s during your stay. Lolo provides a set course dinner which never disappoints from carrot soup, grilled scallop, ginger crusted salmon, chocolate mousse...I could go on. At the communal table you will meet world travelers from jazz musicians to former marines to antique dealers, all interested in gourmet food and good conversation.  I am already planning my next visit after three so far!"
Best Hostel! I picked this Hostel because it was in downtown Tulum but I was pleasantly surprised by how well I was treated here and how nice this Hostel is.   Great reception staff and very comfortable mattress. I slept very nice. Place is beautiful.
A great location with amazing access to your own little beach paradise. My upper level room had sizeable deck with an awesome view of the ocean while still tucked away in the palms for the perfect layer of protection from the sun. The pizza place right across the street was INCREDIBLE and so were the other shops & eateries. Tulum is a dream.
"I cannot speak more highly of this hotel. There was so many hotels to choose from and finally we just made the decision to come here and I am so happy we did. The views are insane, the food is amazing the staff is amazing. They made this trip absolutely 10 out of 10. You get to know the staff they greet you by your name it’s not just that you’re a hotel guest to them they actually care. The food is phenomenal we ate at all the hotels on the strip all the top rated ones and this food outweighed them by far. "

"We were so fortunate to find this Venue and Hotel for our daughter's wedding. Everything was perfect. We had 85 family and friends attend the destination wedding. Renting out the entire hotel was fantastic. Everyone loved their accommodations and the pools, restaurant and bar were great additions. The entire staff was helpful. We had children in our group and there were never any safety issues. In fact we all felt safe and cared for. The wedding ceremony and reception was everything we dreamed. Guests have "

"Really nice little boutique hotel with modern decor and everything you need for a nice holiday.   The staff was very friendly and allowed us a late check out.  The breakfast was good, with yoghurt and muesli and bread and butter/marmalade. Coffee was better than in most places we have stayed."
"My husband and I just spent 2 weeks with Lolo Lorena as a kickoff to our retirement.  Lolo upgraded us to the Honeymoon Suite which was spacious, well-appointed and full of incredible design features. The bed has a wonderful memory foam mattress and the linens were high quality.  There are so many high quality bath towels. We could never use them all. There is Apple tv with Netflix and Prime  Video access.  The wifi is strong and always available. Living in the Colonia, instead of town, gave us a deeper app"
"This I an amazing Hostel!  The location is right in the center with a lot of restaurants, cafes & shops nearby. The staff is super friendly and helpful.   In the garden you have plenty opportunities to relax, use 2 small pools or work on your Laptop with super fast WiFi.   They even have a bar and Tony made some delicious cocktails for me.  I would come back here and I can highly recommend this place."
 much and sodas his whole entire staff. We will come back to Tulum to stay here that’s how amazing this hotel was. Get the ocean view king room. I wish we could’ve stayed longer. Thank you for everything
"We recently stayed for 1 week and everything was fantastic . Food , drinks , staff were all first class  Rooms and pool area lovely , literally on the beach  It’s on a lively small strip with other hotels and amenities  Special mention for Isobel on the front of house , very helpful and charming and Abraham in the restaurant , bar area again so helpful and nothing was to much trouble  The best breakfast we have ever had !!"
"We just returned home after staying at Coco Hacienda and another place in the hotel zone. Without a doubt, I’d much rather stay at Coco Hacienda because of its lovely pools, garden, fabulous food and service. The hotel zone is a cacophony of disco, engines revving and people trying to extract money from you.  If you’re looking to stay in Tulum and want to relax, here’s your place!"
"The place is super well located, really cute and clean. They have an amazing private beach, super nice workers , helpful and friendly and also good food. Too bad that the bar next to it has not only disturbing loud!! Music, but really bad taste :("
"We're frequent visitors of My Way Tulum, the original name and owner of the hotel. This year was the first time we visited Orchid Beach House and our experience was still great. We loved My Way for its quiet and laid back vibes in the midst of an ever-growing Tulum. Although they changed administration, the staff was friendly as always and extremely helpful. We especially adored Mariela, who went out of her way to make our stay very comfortable and nice. We hope you'll retain all of the good vibes My Way br"
"Good experience overall ,good size od the room and bathroom. 2 outside pools well maintained. More breakfast options would be beneficial, I would expect a better choice than granola and bread for the price we have paid."
"This place is the best! Friendly and extremely nice staff, beautiful spaces, and really close to the Main Street which is so fun. Only 30 minute bike ride to the beach. Staff helped with anything that was needed such as renting a scooter or directions. Breakfast was so tasty and more than expected. There was no construction like other posts mentioned either. The place is very clean and the rooms are so cute. Will be coming back and recommending to friends!"
Leo the boss has helped us a lot when we’ve struggled a bit. All staff are super friendly. There is a very nice vibe here. Awesome concert yesterday (Wednesday) and we’ve ended up staying 4 nights instead of one. And happy about staying in a large bed dorm! Best price in Tulum.
…
Compact hotel with a lot in tiny space. The best part is the access to a small beach shared with 3 or 4 resorts. Great to relax on the beach and watch the frigates and pelicans. An iguana visited us one evening on the beach. Should try the cocktails served by the very helpful and friendly Arsenio. 
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I found it last year and decided to try it due to how inexpensive it was to stay here... did not disappoint not one bit. We drove to Tulum so when you're looking for this place it's like uhhh maybe I should've stayed at a resort, but once inside its this beautiful oasis that helps you escape the noise of the world. The staff were incredible and made communication so convenient (via what'sapp), the location is great for walking to a few shops and restaurants, tulum jungle gym is practicall"
"We were meant to stay at Los Arrecifes for 4 nights but unfortunately we had to check out the morning after checking in because it was impossible to sleep. The hotel itself is really nice and the staff were absolutely wonderful, but unfortunately the hotel is located right next to some clubs which were playing loud music with bass all day and all night - until 3am! It was so much that ear plugs didn’t help at all, the walls were literally shaking from the bass. The room itself was spacious and luxurious wit"
"Amazing Hotel and all the staff are extremely helpful!! ** Liz, one of the staff members at the hotel is simply amazing - so helpful with our needs! beautiful personality! 😊 With all the craziness that occurs in Mexico - recently, in Tulum - we felt extremely safe, as they had security all around the area at all times of the day.  "
I would not recommend that hotel. The room was very humid and smells really bad. They were making noise all day long as they are changing staff in the hotel… They should do it without guest inside. One day we couldn’t sleep because of the noice as they were working till 22.00 and also a one member of the staff was listening to music very loud. When we told him to stop the music at 1.00 he said that he is in his room… I mean. Really?   The only good thing is swimming pool.  They also said on the website that
"In the Oostel - Smart Hostel in Tulum you have a great bar downstairs. The barkeeper Toni is always there to serve drinks or to helping the guest who needs something. There's a big open area outside with two pools and a lot of chairs. You can have some free relax for yourself there or doing a party at the rooftop! The hostel is near to the central bus station and the city center. There is transport nearby which brings you to the beach. All in all a really calm, friendly place to spend time at!"
"Love this place!  Amazing staff. Amazing location, great beach, and walking distance to MANY awesome restaurants/bars/beaches/CENOTES!!! (a not miss!!!)/local attractions.  Wish we were still there and want to never leave.  Will definitely be going back."
Wakax Hacienda reminds me of a fantastic theatrical production. When its live for the cameras. Its all glowing with whimsical lighting. However behind the scenes. Once the lights go out. This place drifts into slumber. If you want any attention. You can contact a (non-face to face) of a WhatsApp message to Itzel. Who seems to be the only one holding the fort together.  Or when filming certain areas. Guests are offered (dollars included).  To get off site to a 3 star Poc beach club at Zona Hotelera. Where th
"We had the most wonderful four days in Coco Hacienda. The room was perfect, the jacuzzi was perfect, the swimming pools were wonderful, the ambience was relaxed and chilled. Breakfast was delicious. Staff like Cristopher and the man working the desk during the day between the 13th and 18th April (can't remember his name - I'm sorry!!)  were so so helpful and kind and really wanted us to have the best experience possible. When we had tours booked that meant we missed our breakfast they went out of their way "
" our room at midnight and then couldn’t sleep until 3am when the loud music finally stopped. It is such a shame that what could be such a lovely boutique hotel has been completely ruined by the super noisy clubs next door. When we complained to the staff they were so polite and understanding and allowed us to check out and refund us for the remaining nights and it was such a shame to leave, but unfortunately we simply could not stay somewhere so so loud. So if you are planning on coming to Tulum to party ev"
"We have stayed at countless hotels in several countries but our stay at Una Vida was by far one of the best stays. The staff, the boutique property and the food was just perfect.  We booked their jungle 3 bedroom Villa and it was perfect for our family. Would love to visit again."
I had the most amazing time at Orchid Beach House Tulum. What a beautiful and relaxing place to go to while staying in Tulum. The staff was awesome and also the food and drinks where amazing. Liz made our day; she was always there when we needed something and she such a sweetheart. I can't wait to go back to Orchid Beach House to relax and see Liz
"My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 days in October in the King room with the tub. While the stay itself was pleasant, we were massively over-charged when we arrived. We had booked the hotel online through their website to avoid Airbnb, but when it came to check out through the website, the price we were charged was over $300 more than the price we had been shown on the website. When we raised this issue with the General Manager of the hotel, she agreed that there had been a mistake through the online booking "
"This hostel has potential. Unfortunately, potential is all it has. We arrived to our dorm room where we, not unreasonably, expected there to be lockers to keep our valuables safe. Lockers were in the description of amenities offered. All of the lockers were full and the doors were all broken. The receptionist basically told me there was no solution to this problem. It took me an hour of persistance to convince them to do something and finally they did fix it. This was just the beginning of the problems. Nex"
"Great location, it shares a beach with Azulik!  And a 7 eleven is in very very short walking distance.(like a block, but there aren't blocks there)  This place turned out to be a classic beach front place to stay.  It felt like a step back in time, but with modern creature comforts. Don't expect fancy furnishings, it's a very laid back place, but it's so quaint.  The whole place is filled with antiques, it's awesome. Everything was freshly painted with a distressed look in our room and we had a very large o"
" this place down is the indifferent service.  On checking in. Its all very efficient. You have to sign a disclaimer, presumably in case you might drown in the lake. It's not going to be their fault if you can't swim. So make sure you have good insurance. Once the official paper work was out of the way. I was carted off to my room. Suitcase just dumped behind the bed area. I wasn't offered a welcome drink. Or shown around the room.  Hardly the warmest of greetings.  The veranda has dirty cushions. I know thi"
Great place with a great location. Right on the road to the beach and yet very close to the city centre. Staff are very very helpful polite and professional. Rooms are big and clean! We stayed 2 nights and decided to extend for another night.   The restaurant on premises has excellent food. We've ordered ceviche everywhere we went on our 3 week trip in Mexico and this was top 3! Good value for money too. Our server Carlos at the restaurant was amazing. Very good energy and super attentive.   We highly rate 
 been planning to stay in a hostel but he has since been persuaded to look into Coco Hacienda's website :) I'm only sorry it has taken me 2 weeks to sit down and finally write this review because we are so grateful to you all for an incredible end to me and mum's holiday in Mexico.  Thank you!!

"Such an amazing place ! Beautiful decor, huge rooms lovely pool ! Like an oasis in the middle of the jungle ! So close to everything. Take the bikes ride to the beach ! Pool is wonderful and vibe is great  Staff are just wonderful and so so helpful love this place"
"This hotel was beyond beautiful, but the staff was even better ! They went above and beyond to accommodate us like no other place I’ve been too ! I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend this amazing hotel !"
"Orchid Beach House made itself a new go-to beach club for us over Easter week.  Small and chill scene, great sun and shade spots, delish food (ceviche) and drink (a real-deal Mojito) and best of all the service: Primo is a master, with his beach partner Lis, his nephew Demitrio, and manager Edvang."
" reimburse us, and feel entirely scammed. Both the hotel and the management did not help us …! Also the hotel was under major renovations which were loud and not very visually appealing. Nothing was offered to us, and we were not made aware of them prior to arrival. We are extremely disappointed with our experience and will never recommend to anyone."
 drilling in sweat. There are 16 double beds in the dorm meaning that there can be up to 32 people in this tiny dorm at once. There was nowhere to store the many bags which means bags were littered throughout the dorm on the floor. Climbing down from the top bunk meant risking stepping on someone’s bag and potentially injuring yourself. Last but not least was the lack of hot water (which was also advertised) we experienced in the morning. I turned the tap on and let it run hoping it would finally warm up bu
" the bathroom didn't quite shut properly so if that's going to bother you don't stay in room A.  Can't say for the rest of the rooms, to us it wasn't a big deal.  There is a restaurant on property and they will serve you there, at the covered oceanfront terrace by the pool or on the beach itself, which was very nice.  The shrimp tacos were the best I have ever had and the breakfast offered every morning was very good.  They offer coffee, mango juice, toast and a choice of made to order omelets , scrambled e"

"Super sad about this experience, we choose this hotel accordong to the reviews but during our stay we totally don’t get why people recommend this hotel. The staff probably doesn’t know what hospitality means. Our room was dirty when we arrived, the pool is full of leaves all the time, the bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows - it feels like they are full of clothes, like jeans or jackets - not any of pillow material :) :) :) The first night there was a party near the hotel and the music was extremely l"

Marta and staff made sure our stay was fantastic , clean room every day , amazing food and drinks and the best view we could ask for .  Music t night was loud until 1am but we didn’t mind at all because we stayed up late and slept in very well . Loved everything about it ."
"We stayed at Una Vida for 5 nights during our 3 week honeymoon and I honestly think that it was the best hotel that we stayed at on our trip. The place itself is stunning, the rooms are decorated in a gorgeous way, as is the rest of the hotel. It has a great sized pool and a cute restaurant on site and you also have access to the sister hotel, Bardo, so you can use their restaurant and pool too which is great.  The staff are next level. They go above and beyond for you and make you feel so very welcome. Ari"
"Reserved a dinner in the nests, got here and was told all kinds of minimums per person. Two types of nests one had minimum of $150 pp, other has $100 pp. For beach there’s $60, $80, or $100 minimums for different types of tables. Good experience!"
"The place is alright.. nothing major or special about it. Definitely super expensive for what you're getting, but it didn't matter - my friends and I were in Tulum after 2 years of not having traveled, and we wanted to splurge. Upon arrival, no one came to help with the luggage.. let that pass, not a big deal. Over and above the high price we had to pay for a basic stay, they charged us deposits which they said is only a HOLD and won't be charged. On checkout, they confirmed the hold has been released.

"We came here on our honeymoon, and this is far and away the best place I have ever stayed in my life. We even extended our stay an extra night because it was so perfect. From the pictures we could tell it was stunning and beautifully designed, but it was even more incredible in real life. The room was gorgeous, luxuriously comfortable and smelled amazing, with of course the classic useful amenities too like coffee facilities and a fridge in the room.

"Lovely stay at Suenos Tulem, located right on the beach with a beautiful pool. The grounds are exceptionally well landscaped, with fascinating lizards all around. Recommended for a stay with small children, you can have yummy breakfast, lunch and dinner with your toes in the sand and drinks/food all very reasonably priced compared to other establishments nearby. All staff are very friendly and helpful."

They really went above and beyond to make our stay as relaxing and enjoyable as possible and they succeeded. The service, food, drink, pool and rooms were all first-rate. Elizabeth, Ivan, Ana and others are extremely nice and had several great suggestions for activities off the resort and great dinner recommendations. The hotel setting is extremely unique and is a true oasi"
"I highly recommend staying at Coco Hacienda Tulum. Our group booked 4 rooms, and two rooms were upgraded at no cost because better rooms were available. I think this speaks to their approach - provide the best experience possible. Other highlights: -Great air conditioning in rooms -2 lovely pools -Tasty breakfast at the restaurant  -Can arrange for spa treatments in the room  -Very quiet at night  The only issue was that the Wi-Fi was hit or miss in our room, but I got a good signal if I walked a few steps "
"This hotel is basically a scam and it’s unlivable.. the rooms might be ok (nothing special), but this hotel is so close to the nightclub called Taboo that the walls of the rooms are literally shaking. I know that Tulum is hardly a quiet place these days, but living in that hotel would be equal to sleeping at a techno concert under the stage. Literally unlivable"
" lovely and attentive. If you're looking for a reasonable, bohemian place to stay in Tulum then look no further! Only a 20 min taxi (about £20) to Tulum beach, 10 min walk to Tulum town and close to centoes - you can't go wrong.  Thank you to all of the team for making our stay so special, we will never forget it!"
"I spent hours researching hotels in Tulum before I made a reservation. I wanted luxury without an exorbitant price; an authentic Tulum vibe, not some generic, corporate hotel atmosphere; beauty and style in the rooms and location; and a destination where I could just relax and enjoy.   Hotel Panamera is all these things and more. It exceeded my most optimistic expectations. The staff was welcoming and helpful from the moment we arrived until we checked out. They got to know us by name during the week we sta"

We will definitely be coming back and recommending Kanan to all our friends."
" actual statements showing the date those amounts got posted for me and my friends, they lie to our faces. If it's a small amount, I wouldn't be posting this - but among the 3 of us, it's close to a $1,000. There were a few other people that week too who got charged, so I wonder when they'll realize they've been hustled. We can't even dispute the charge because our physical cards were present, even though when the amounts were actually authorized, we were back in Canada. Do NOT stay here. Since management c"
"No wifi! The hotel is still under refurbishment and does not look clean! There were flies all around the open buffett breakfast. Disappointing, not recommending! It looks like a construction area and the money you pay for that place is too much for this quality hotel."
"We went to check in at 3 pm, but were told to wait for 10 minutes. We got the room after 2 hours. Then it wasn't ready, there were no towels or linen. The aircondition didn't work.

"We enjoyed a relaxing, low-key week on this beach where it is increasingly difficult to find that quiet, relaxed vibe that made Tulum popular in the first place.  The hotel is family run, and that shows in the genuine, friendly attitude of all who work here to do their best to make sure you enjoy your stay. The rooms and beds are charming (if I wanted beige I'd go to New York) and comfortable.  The tropical garden is livingly tended. The expansive beach is sublime.  You never feel crowded by other guests.  "
"We had an amazing vacation Thank you for the warm welcome from Ivan, Elizabeth,  Anna, &  Abdiel. We received superb service from Efrain, Alejandro, and  Ricardo. Kudos to your entire team from food preparations, housekeeping, maintenance, great customer service, & we are great full with all the excellent recommendations of restaurants, transportation, & amenities. We look forward in returning in non salgaso season to enjoy the beach. Thank you to all & sad to go home."
"It was an amazing stay at the Coco Hacienda. We also got an room upgrade and enjoyed the 4 nights at the hotel really much.  The staff is smiling the whole day. Supportive and really friendly. Breakfast at the poolside.  Cocktails are delicious and the Tacos are amazing.  Thank you so much, for making our days so wonderful"
"The good:  This is just what you‘d expect of Tulum: An insanely beautiful stretch of sand. Perfect views from every room. Very boutique and private feel. Tasteful decoration. Sophisticated yet casual eateries close by. Convenient parking in the backyard. Although prices in Tulum are very steep by international standards and you usually get less quality than expected, this place was worth every penny.  The bad:  As of January 2021 there are two large beach clubs right next to the property (Taboo and Tantra)."
"Hotel Tiki Tiki was perfect in every way. The staff & staff cats are all amazing!! The staff, especially Yesica and Melissa, we’re so helpful with anything we needed. The breakfast each morning was beyond delicious. & Damien was the best bartender in all of Tulum! We will 100% be back!!"

" beach, she was there to provide all the services we wanted--towels for the lounges, an umbrella to shade us, servers to take our orders for drink and food. During any given afternoon, she would check on us to make sure we got whatever we wanted. The beach was lovely, even if it had banks of seaweed that washed ashore as the tide came in. The pool was relaxing. Try an Aperol spritz while you lounge near the water. It' s my new favorite drink.   The rooms have a simple, spare beauty. The rain shower was just"
Beautiful experience with different seating options.   The service was efficient and friendly.   Our server Roger did a great job of making our experience memorable!   Would definitely recommend if you are interested :)

This hotel is a building site with noise from 7.30am and dust everywhere. We left after the first night as it is also in the middle of nowhere. And if you can't sit and chill by the pool because of the building site what's there to do.  Also very dodgy locks at the gate of property. Friend could get inside for about 20 minutes and there is nobody there at night to help open the door. Taxi to the beach is 600 mex pesos at night so very expensive to go out to the restaurants and beach. Very disappointed.  Hot
"Stayed here alone and the place was very welcoming. Standard rooms but great feeling in the communal, bar, pool and rooftop areas. Staff were all great and very friendly and helpful, including the front desk, bar and restaurant. Leo and Rodrygo and Co. provided the party were super friendly, inviting guests out to places and always up for a drink around the hostel. The Sunday rooftop party was great with a banging sound system and djs that loved what they do. All the best guys hope to see you again some tim"

"Check in was uncomfortable with demands for payment made immediately and insisting we use a different card to the one we wanted to - and a sudden rate hike adding a good 15% to the bill. Room incredibly uncomfortable - bed is hard, pillows feel like a couple sacks stuffed with any bits of cloth they can find. Hot tub isn’t a hot tub, water is luke warm and takes hours to fill… and when it does work there’s a very strange, unclean smell.  When we mentioned we were disappointed at check out the hotel didn’t c"

Here are my thoughts   Pros: -beautiful hotel location is remote a bit but it’s perfect if you are looking for a place to relax  - amazing concierges, you feel like that you are treated Individually you can always ask anything recommandation or help they are all super nice and their services are great  -great pool - really good food without leaving the hotel   Cons: - isolation of the room you can hear everything  I mean everything from your neighbors  (even sneezing)we were "
My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it did not disappoint! It was so hard to leave our beautiful room at the end of our stay. We were blown away when we walked up to our room. They had set out some flowers as they knew it was our honeymoon as well. We had an amazing balcony that was beautiful and so peaceful. The trees and garden around the hotel were beautiful. We constantly admired all the birds flying around the hotel. So peaceful! An ideal place to stay in Tulum! Cristopher and his staff 
"Great place to stay in Tulum. Great vibes, great staff! Highly recommended!!! Stayed there for four nights. Fantastic pool and bar. We also always got great recommendations for day trips within and around Tulum!! Definitely a good choice to get a good Tulum experience!"
"One of best hotels I have ever stayed in!  The customer service is A****!! So helpful, attentive and kind. Made the stay one we will never forget.  Travelled with our 6 month old, and they are so kind setting up shade areas, making her smoothies and suggesting baby friendly places.  Hotel is stunning… Beautiful rooms, with great showers. Pool area is so relaxing and chilled. Great food and drinks menu.  Aristides who works there is brilliant. Always on hand to help and offer his local advice."

"Beautiful structure, literally living in a jungle for a week.  Their Spa worth a try ,  Kanan  has the most kind and attentive staff that you wish or your holiday!  We had an issue which has been deal professionally .. Special thank you to Natalia ."
"Orchid Beach House un lugar hermoso, con comida muy rica, buena presentación y ricos smoothies sin duda volvería a ir!  A beautiful place with good food and nice presentation I would go back if I visit Tulum again."
"Excellent location, very good Wi-Fi and co-working options for digital nomads. The breakfast was very tasty and the staff super friendly. The garden and pool area are very nice and inviting. The capsules were spacious enough. Bring some earplugs though, as you can hear literally everything. Defintely a very good option if you want something were you can get some work done! I recommend it!"
"Amazing service, because of delayed flight from paris the staff took care off my 19 years old daughter who flew in from montreal.  Suits are really nice, food is great. Hiden paradise in the jungle Itzel,Javier and Edgar thank you for maken us feel at home  Walifa, Jill, Zalifa and Elfie"
"Nice place to stay, affordable prices, staff is very helpful and polite. There’s a swimming pool and restaurant on site. Room as described and clean. Has a mini fridge. Soap and shampoo (no conditioner on the amenities). Reliable Wi-Fi. Comfy bed. No surprises. Walking distance 10-20min from lots of restaurants and commercial areas.  Need a car or scooter to go to the beach/ ruins/ cenotes. They can help with tours on site."
…
 maintenance over. - most of the time when we were ordering breakfast the order came a little wrong  and it took about 30min to 1hours to get your food ( definitely not a big deal but I just wanted to mentioned that)  So my conclusion is that is a great hotel beautiful concierge are AMAZING food is great however I am very sensitive to the noise and the isolation of the room was a big problem for me other than that it was great .  Thank you
 next to some restaurants and shops. So much good food in Tulum! I’m very happy we did not stay at the beach as it was way more crowded and hectic. We were still only a short drive from the beach but this hotel was significantly more laid back. We were pretty close to a few cenotes and the lagoon and were able to take a scooter to both. We can’t stop talking about how amazing our experience at this hotel was. Thank you! We cannot wait to come back!
"This spacious and clean house/hotel seems to be designed and run as a corporate retreat. We rented it as 4 women with 4 kids. It didn’t suit our needs as it wasn’t private and secluded as we had hoped. There are a lot of very helpful and friendly staff around outside the hotel and in the hotel. The pool and yard are visible to the neighboring house, which can be rented as well. It’s the not the kind of place to unwind and watch a movie in your underclothes as someone may walk in at any moment and restock yo"
"What an amazing place in crazy Tulum. We stayed 7 nights with our 11 year old daughter. The room was incredible, lost in nature. You wake up with the sound of beautiful birds. We even spotted Toucans! Very nice pool with beautiful settings. There is a rooftop terrace which has amazing view on the jungle. The staff is super friendly and super helpful They gave us the best tips and made our holiday. We even felt sad to say good-bye. Tiki Tiki also has the best bartender in town, def check it out!

The highlight for us was definitely the impeccable service we had particularly from Aris and Paola… they are literally the nicest, kindest people you’ll ever meet. So hospitable and made us feel at home. The heated pool was so lovely and our one year old daughter absolutely loved it. The hotel is beautifully decorated and so peaceful.. def no parties or loud music.. really makes it an oasis in crazy tulum. With a one year old it meant in the evening we were restri"

Great food and amazing service especially Alba who took care of me making sure i had a great time every time i visit the beach front with her smile and good recommendations of things to do and places to visit. Definitely will come back next year. keep up the good work"
We picked this hotel for our honeymoon solely because of pictures of the pool.  What we encountered was a perfectly curated balance of isolation and cool vibes.  This beach club offers picturesque ocean access and the most chill/vacation music playlist sounding all day.   The restaurant has classic food options that are well executed -chef approved ;) - and service was friendly and attentive without feeling overwhelming (they leave you alone if you want them to).  If you like to party; there’s an event sche
"The hotel is a “work of art”.  Just awesome, as the crew.  They are all great. Place very well located, can walk all Tulum hot spots.  Perfect place to rest, or if you prefer, have fun.   The restaurants are very good and the shows at the nest are unmissable."
"This hotel is like a little hidden jewel on the beach. We loved every minute of our stay from waking up to our delicious breakfast in the morning to some of the best cocktails in the area. The staff Primo,Diego and Liz were absolutely wonderful and management kindly catered to all of our needs. We will definitely be back next year!"
"Definitely does not worth that price! The room smells awfully bad! We let the staff know about it, and they could not do anything effective because it was coming from the shower tubes (the room was cleaned again and the smell came back a few hours after).  On top of that we were deprived from water the 1rst day from our arrival 6pm to the next morning 9am! Impossible to use toilets or shower (after a 20hour flight and a swin in the sea it was such an issue!) We wanted to talk to the manager as the staff cou"
"It looks and feels  like a tropical paradise at the resort. You can literally walk around the resort barefoot (buckets of water were provided by the room doors to dip your feet in, to not track sand in the room). The Mayan decor throughout the resort, and in the room was a nice touch. There was even a hammock in the room. The bed in the room was extremely comfortable, the room was really clean, & cleaned daily. There was no need to leave the resort with soothing music playing,  the beach literally a few fee"

"i love a hotel with a strong concept and this one certainly has one - Mexicana meets mid-century Miami, which is successfully executed and super stylish in an understated yet colourful way.  But the best thing about this hotel is the staff - especially Melissa and Yesica at reception, as well as Damian at the bar.  The girls went out of their way to help and were so friendly and nice.  Great for solo travellers, I felt super safe at all times and you can walk to restaurants and cafes nearby, although the pl"
" weirdly the lounge to our one room suite was separate from the bedroom (it was as if they were two separate hotel rooms, separated by a hallway with two doors and separate keys).. maybe not an issue for some people but as we were with our baby we couldn’t relax being in a separate room .. if I would have known this I probably wouldn’t have booked this room. The only other thing I would point out is that the hotel is quite out of the way.. not really close to the centre nor to the beach (that also has its g"

I came to the Kanan Hotel’s Restaurant to celebrate my graduation and it was a phenomenal experience. I was traveling alone but Roger and the rest of the staff made me feel so welcomed. The servers were extremely kind and attentive; they even took some photos for me and brought out sparklers and a house cocktail for my birthday. It’s rare to find such a unique experience and truly caring group of people when traveling to popular locations abroad. I will definitely be back and I recommend that everybody come
"Only there for the amazing food. We lived in a hotel next to it, went here almost everyday. Best lunch place along the beach. Great tacos, amazing burritos, cheap prices, and friendly and fun staff. The vibe was great, simple as that. Compared to other places along the beach, the quality-price ratio was a steal. It took time to get the food, but hey, that’s okey, when one is on vacation and the food is that good, it’s worth the wait."
 option! Ps: the only positive thing is a the Argentinian girl at reception who was kind.

" very accommodating. I also appreciated the sunblock & mosquito sprays that were available in the open lobby for guest to use. The continental breakfast was really good, filling, and extremely fresh. It included freshly squeezed juice, yogurt with fresh fruit & granola that was made at the premises. Breakfast also included scrambled eggs, & croissants/breads.  I mostly ate the chicken tacos which were good as well. I really enjoyed the fresh hot salsa that they provided with all my meals (I requested it & t"
"Thanks to all the staff at Radhoo for being so attentive and making our week in Tulum stress free. The concierge team and all the staff have been amazing. With a special mention to Alessandro who’s cheeky smile at breakfast has got our days off on the right foot. The space itself has been perfect and has everything we expected. Amazing room, pool, bar, free yoga on a Monday and beach access across the street in the sister hotel Encantada made it even better. Everything we could have hoped for and more."
"My wife and I had a a wonderful stay at Hotel Tiki Tiki. The pool was great, crafty and clean with a beautiful green surrounding and bird sounds. The bar food (quesadillas) great and homemade drink Tiki Tiki was refreshing and needed after a long day in Tulum. The breakfast is fresh and that includes fresh squeezed orange juice among other baked breads that are delightful. I recommend hotel especially if you rent a car, since they offer free parking. Wish the beds were softer but everything and all of the s"

"The hotel common areas are beautiful, the staff very friendly and attentive, and we enjoyed the convenience of ordering food and drinks from the restaurant while lounging at the beach. The staff is ready to accommodate umbrellas when the sun gets harsh which was perfect for us. You do have to get there early to claim chairs though! It is also a beach club that can be used by those who aren’t necessarily staying in the hotel.   My 3 star review is for the actual rooms. They are bare bones, almost to the poin"
"Our stay was fantastic. The property is absolutely stunning and it feels like being in a giant tree house. The view on the ocean is fantastic, beach access, and the rooms are beautifully decorated. Ours had a super nice bathtub. The location is great as you are in a lively part of Tulum beach. There is a lot of music which we enjoyed and we also slept well regardless, but if you are looking for a peaceful stay, maybe it’s not the right hotel for you. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We got a massa"
"I come to Tulum often and because this hotel had a friendly guest policy I decided to give it a try; BIG MISTAKE!  Summary of what was wrong during my stay:  •	The picture advertised on Travelocity showed my room with a desk and chair, when I arrived there was no desk and chair   •	They didn’t have washcloths for your face or body  •	The AC in my unit was horrible, it barely made the room cold •	On one day the power to the entire hotel was out for a few hours!!!!!!! •	The biggest deal breaker for me was the"

"Overall, I loved staying at Tiki Tiki. Quiet, the sound of birds in the morning and evening. Well maintained and clean. The aesthetic is beautiful. Staff was very friendly and constantly helpful, spoke really good english. Breakfast was sufficient, fruits and granola, bread with jam of butter with coffee or tea. Room had AC. My room faced the jungle and had a lovely balcony.  The main reason I removed 1 star is the location. Tiki Tiki is at the very end of Tulum which means everything takes a while to get t"
Great stylish appartement with bohemian feel. We spent much time in the warm pool. Staff is so friendly and knowledgable. Food is great!  We enjoyed our stay very much. They have bikes and a lovely food truck park with music and dance around the corner.
"A beach front and pool hotel with amazing roof top for unreal sunsets and tasty food.   Location, decor, staff, service, music, drinks... everything was perfect!   Thanks to all the staff and, of course, to Celia for making our experience in Panamera unforgettable.  Make sure you visit this hotel if you ever be in Tulum."
The room was absolutely incredible. The staff was top notch and could not have been nicer. One of the cleanest hotels you can stay at in Tulum.  My girlfriend and I moved hotels because we wanted to try 2 hotels and all we wanted to do was get back to Kanan. 10/10
"My friends and I stayed at Suenos for 5 days and it was simply paradise on earth. I cannot recommend this hotel enough - the staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and well taken care of. Our room was clean, comfortable and cool (despite no air conditioning at night!). The complimentary breakfast is healthy and a delicious start to each day. The beach is clean, private, quiet and relaxing, and a short walk to the busier beach clubs. The ocean is simply divine and any seaweed is meticulously cl"
"Alejandro and Edwin are awesome. Great breakfast at Radhoo hotel. The hotel atmosphere is incredible. Ana, Ivan and Abby are very kind and supportive. They arranged a romantic dinner for us and everything was perfect."
 restaurants I was interested in was at least a 25 min walk.  Other minor issues - the shower just never got that hot and didn't have great pressure. The fan looked wonky but it did work.
"Great property. The design thoughtful and absolutely spot on for the location and positioning of an excellent boutique hotel it has a great beach, great pool setup, a new rooftop sunset bar. Their biggest strength however is The team which is great and very well trained. Especially david at the front desk and Carlos on the beach. Reminds me a lot of soho house vibe, the design especially of soho house miami. The only areas of improvement would be elevate the F&B, perhaps add some more storage in the rooms a"

"I recently stayed at Radhoo (which was reserved for Wedding guests). The couple must have done their homework. They wanted their guests to feel top notch comfort, service, and the best amenities. The rooms are clean, surpringly spacious despite being a small imprint. Our room faced into the West and directly bordered the natural jungle and greenery.

All the design details (the tiles and the striped pool!) are immaculate and the friendly staff are beyond welcoming and helpful…from the bartender (damien makes the best cocktails) to the cleaning crew.

"Small cozy well packed room for a great stay at isla mujeres if you rent a golf car. away from the noisy area of the island, suggested for mature people. I enjoyed the location because i had a car with me making it easy to get everywhere."
"I stayed at Casitas del Mar on a solo portion of my trip.  These units are across the road from the ocean and there are paths to walk down to the beach.  Perfect place for sunrises.  Beds are comfortable, a/c and fans in the room, kitchen is basic but has everything you need. The bathroom has ""saloon"" type doors so not complete privacy in case that's an issues.  Plenty of parking in front for a golf cart.  If you want to stay away from the noise and activity from Centro this is a great option."
"This was our 1st visit to Isla Mujeres and it was amazing.  We enjoyed being in the Colonias, the view & we were close to lots of restaurants & shops.  The room was comfortable and the a/c worked well & the bed was very comfortable.  We also enjoyed getting to know the couples that came and went in the other 3 units there.  Joyce provided a ton of info before we arrived and there was a great guest book upon arrival....all very helpful.  Joyce and Bob were wonderful & we are so glad we got to meet them.  We "
"We recently spent two glorious weeks in one of these comfortable, well-appointed casitas.  Here there are beautiful views of the Caribbean as well as soft ocean breezes.  The hosts, Joyce and Bob, are warm and welcoming.  The area around the casitas has lots of interesting local restaurants to explore.  In front of the casitas is a beautiful shoreline.  The casita just offers a place to relax and dream."
This was our first visit to Isla Mujeres. We will be back. Casitas del Mar was amazing. It was a prefect size place with everything you would need. We did have a issue with the internet and they were all over it and had it fixed. The owners were so nice and helpful. They even gave us a ride at 6am. The view from right out front was amazing. We love this place. Really loved the book of tips they give you. This is the prefect place for a couple.
"Picture a studio apartment with everything you could possibly need to settle in and make it your own. A space beautifully planned, with a compact complete kitchen, a spacious bath with full shower and plenty of hot water, all the kitchen implements and appliances you need. Add a comfortable queen size bed, great lighting, A/C if need it and a very cozy blanket if you don't. All this comes with the ocean at your doorstep, and a palapa to sit enjoying your morning coffee or your evening cocktail. All this for"

The casitas are fully equipped; beautiful bedding; ocean views.  Owners Bob and Joyce; were not only hospitable but very helpful on things to do; restaurants to visit.   We rented a golf cart one day for 8 hours which was more than enough time to circle the island to see all it has to offer.  A day spent on north beach was great! We wal"
"Casitas Del Mar was a fabulous spot for our first trip to the Isla Mujeres.  It was a perfect size and had absolutely everything we needed for our stay.  Bob and Joyce were fantastic hosts.  They were always very attentive and responsive, and helpful in every way.   Clean and comfortable, and we enjoyed our stay immensely.  I will be back."
"Loved the Casitas!  Waking up to that beautiful view was just a great way to start the day.  Joyce and Bob were wonderful hosts, super helpful and gracious.  Loved the location within an easy walk to some of the best restaurants on the island...  Bastos, Limon, Oscars, Deisy & Raul El Charco, Mango Cafe, so great.  Great value.  The room had everything you need with its small kitchen, coffee pot, etc.  One of the highlights was walking across the street to sit and watch the beautiful sunrise over the Carrib"
Casitas del Mar is a perfect place to stay if you want to be out of the busy downtown area but still have all that you need within walking distance!  Waking up each morning to take a walk along the Carribean side of the ocean was good for the soul.  Sitting under the palapas in the evening and feeling the ocean breeze was beautiful and relaxing. We were able to rent two casitas (one for my husband and I and the other for my son) for an extremely affordable price and had all we needed to make our stay comfor
"We just got back from a lovely stay!  This was the first time to Isla Mujeres.  It was wonderful, primarily because of the relaxing, enjoyable time we had at Worldmark Isla Mujeres.  The whole staff were fabulous  in taking care of our needs and making sure we were comfortable.  Jaime was superb!  He helped us with getting settled into our perfect room and answering our questions.  Alberto and Luigi were also incredibly helpful!  The rooms were clean and very comfortable.  We look forward to returning here "
"Worldmark cancelled our reservation without notification. Three days before our arrival they cancelled our reservation in what looked like a standard advertisement email.   We were not the only ones!  Other customers were stranded in a remote island without assistance. We have been told that this is Worldmarks standard for customer care.  Cancel your customer, put them on an endless hold and then leave them to figure it out for themselves.  Worldmark will mess up your vacation and leave you to clean up thei"

The location mid island is great for exploring either up north in the town, or go south to the Cliff of Dawn, Garrafon pa"
I wanted to Love this resort but it just didn't deliver.  The headache of having to trek all your luggage on the ferry was exhaustive.  The resort itself is adorable but not very comfortable.  The one bedroom that sleeps four truly only sleeps two (couples only).  The sofa bed is something weird and was incredibly uncomfortable for my guest.  They even bought a mattress to accomdate.  The unit are very cute but hard and insects everywhere.  They really need to spray.  I think this might be the only WM I won
"We really enjoyed this resort.  Staff was great, grounds and room was clean and well cared for. On a previous day trip to Isla Mujeres we had stopped by on a whim and were given a tour of the resort. When planning for a 2 month trip to the Riviera Maya we wanted to spend a few nights here. Of course the resort was pretty full and only a few night’s available.  Worldmark reservations were a big help to get 3 nights in the type of room we wanted.

We arrived Feb 26-March 5. I generally always stay at a Riu but this was the first time I have stayed at a Riu Palace. It was so amazing! The staff was unreal. So nice. Super sweet and very friendly! You could really tell they appreciated my business. It was also my bday during this trip and we didn’t tell any staff. They decorated our bed with balloons and made a bday cake out of the towels and out fresh rose petals on it. I felt so good when I saw it. Then we went for lunch and came back to the room and y
My 24-year old daughter and I loved our stay at Las Palmas.  Kate is such a warm and welcoming host which is evidenced by all the regulars who stay there every year.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was a little small for 2 women but it worked fine for us and the outdoor community areas at the hotel are so beautiful and everyone we met was so friendly.  The hotel is in a perfect location very close to everything and quiet and safe at night.  My only regret is we didn't stay longer.  I
"Everything about our stay at Casa Lola exceeded expectations.  The house is kept in immaculate condition - both inside and out, throughout the entire stay.  The wifi worked perfectly, and checking in and out is extremely seamless.  The concierge staff was super helpful and responsive around the clock.

"I just returned from a lovely 17 day stay at Las Palmas. The first 11 days were with my husband and the last week was with my sister celebrating her 60th birthday! To say it was a beautiful,relaxing, sunny vacation is an understatement. It was just the best in so many ways!   Las Palmas made it simple with its fantastic location 2 blocks from the most beautiful beach, Playa Norte, 1 block from the great shops and restaurants on Hildago, and directly across the street from 3 delicious places to grab breakfas"
"This hotel is situated on a lovely property with a pool, small beach, and restaurant. Unfortunately, our room had a street view, but it was a nice room with vaulted ceilings and a private patio. One small thing to note, the bathroom door is made of wood slats, and if you're chilling in the bedroom you can see right into the bathroom. If you're traveling with people you're not comfortable with seeing in the bathroom, maybe book a few more rooms. Our stay was nice and quiet, the staff is somewhat helpful. We "

There are several stairs to your condo but the view and space is worth it! Comfortable beds, full kitchen, friendly and incredibly helpful staff. Will recommend & stay again!"
"If you’re coming during May-August and are escaping the seaweed plague of Cancun/Playa del Carmen, this is the place to be. The hotel staff is very nice and accommodating (especially Romi!) the bar and restaurant are at your disposal via room service and beach service. The beach is quite literally attached to the hotel (basically in its backyard). It has the best beach in all of the island (Playa Norte) with clear waters and soft white sand. And as if all that wasn’t enough, the main shopping and dining str"

They provide water and lots of drinks and snacks at very reasonable prices.  Kate is a great resource for information about the island and recommendations. There are many places not to be missed mid-island as well and a taxi ride is $5 at most.   It is a beautiful island filled with sunshine, sand, water, music and great food and drinks!

" They also scheduled massages for our group, which were outstanding! These ladies understood the body and our group is very picky about massage. Everyone agreed the massages were excellent.   Our cleaning crew was fabulous and we would wake up to a spotless house every morning, without being disturbed while sleeping. Once we moved downstairs for the day, the cleaning crew moved upstairs, so we came back to spotless rooms every night. I am impressed with these hard-working ladies.  My favorite part about the"
"Beatiful place. Tropical water. We didn't eat here, so can't help with the food  reviews.  However,we got quoted a price of $150 for 6 people  to rent beach chairs and 3 drinks per person, Instead we were charged $240.00 Needless to say, WE WON'T BE COMING BACK"

"This is my second review for Las Palmas.   You may or may not get the flavour of the island staying in a resort facility, but you certainly will staying at the Las Palmas. And the flavour is riddled with relax, take your time, chill out while you warm your winter bones, eat, drink, and definitely be merry.   Located in the north downtown district and one street parallel to the busy pedestrian tourist shop and restaurant laden calle Hidalgo, Las Palmas is ideally situated. A quick walk takes you off to the P"
Guests at Marina Paraiso often played the music so loudly in the boat that it could be heard at other businesses even when I was inside with the door and windows closed. When we asked for the music to be turned down it was turned up even louder. They broadcast the music to outside speakers.It was not all guests but one boat in particular. One day they broadcast what sounded like a porno movie. Not cool.

I have stayed at this resort a total of 5 times. Every time I come back the stay is better than the last. Waking up early to the birds chirping and napping on the beach all day while drinking pina coladas was my agenda for the time I stayed. Something about it feeling not as commercial and having a traditional feel makes the experience all the better.  The cleaning service is more than exceptional. Making friends here was an ease because everyone is very kind and just there to have fun. another great part o

This is a gem of place if you’re looking for some island luxury, in a boutique setting at a still very reasonable price.  The grounds, rooms, and pool are immaculate and so welcoming day and night. Ashley and Curtis welcome you with open arms and equip you with lots of tips to make the most of your time of the island.  The morning coffee and breakfast were incredible.

I would be embarrassed admit how many trips I have already made to this beautiful hotel. Ixel is so very beautifully maintained and with the most positive kind courteous and attentive staff I have ever experienced.

However nothing is better than a beautiful breakfast with Alejandra in the hotel Restaurant :)  Chapel Eli and Ricardo deliver beautiful nachos or ceviche under your umbrella as you

A very peaceful setting with beautiful views of the ocean and pool right from our room. Good food and friendly service. We could walk to the massive grocery store and there were restaurants along the way. Nice bathroom, and firm but comfortable beds. The TV worked well but we only used it one night.   WiFi was available in the pool, restaurant and bar area. This drove my 13 yea"

We took full advantage of the kayaks and paddle boards, we did yoga on the rooftop terrace (they even had yoga mats!), provided us with beach towels, golf carts, concierge service to call taxis and make island recommendations. We didn't eat out much elsewhere since the chef truly was phenomenal. I love spicy food and made a fresh habanero sauce for me every day! The Mexican eggs benedict for breakfast was mind blowing.

This is a great mid-range complex; not luxurious but a great value for the price.  Reception and check in was fast and efficient. Grounds are very well-maintained, pool is nice and never too busy and staff is friendly.  There is a restaurant in front of the condos (not part of the resort) called Mayan Beach Club that has good food and very reasonable prices.  Our unit, 24, was i"

" Punta Sur or Playa Norte. If you aren’t a walker in the heat, Ashley can help you get a golf cart brought to the Villa.  Bedsides all the above amazing things, I’d say three things make me want to come back here over other locations.  1 - They work hard to be green here which matters even more on an island.  2 - There is a wonderful team of staff working here, who have been with the Villa for a long time. You can tell they all care and that makes the stay even better.  3 - It’s a small business with six ro"

"Just returned from spending 10 days at Hotel Las Palmas. This is an ideal place to stay in Isla for the solo traveler or for anyone wanting to meet other travelers. From the beginning Kate was extremely helpful in providing information and guidance on how to experience the island. Las Palmas has a 'hostel for adults' feel about it (I'm in my 60's) with many beautiful communal areas to choose from, whether you want to relax by yourself or socialize with others.   Great quiet location, close to the main road "

" clothes/suitcases.  The only two downsides are that there is only one tv in the unit and the living area and lanai furniture are not comfortable for lounging. Although we didn’t spend a lot of time in the unit, it would still have been nice to have a comfortable seating area for lounging in the evening and if you are traveling with another couple or kids you might want a tv in the bedrooms. Overall, Nautibeach is a great place to stay and we’d definitely stay there again."

Fabulous hotel and great service.  Everyone was the nicest.  Rooms were clean and well taken care.   The beach is fabulous. And beach service was on point.  Great hotel. I would stay here above a VRBO which is what we rented before on Isla.  Close walk to restaurants and shops just down the street.  The beach massages are also to die for.

"This was our first 'real' family vacation since the beginning of the pandemic.  So our expectations were very high.  I am happy to say that Casa Lola and Isla Mujeres exceeded on all measures.  The villa itself is spacious, thoughtfully designed, and comfortable.  Nearly every room has not only ocean views, but also private outdoor space befitting the best resorts.  The living and dining areas are massive and open entirely to the patio, pool, and beachfront.  Sunset views are gorgeous.  As much as we enjoye"

We were very sceptical because of the lack of current reviews and the older reviews were not appealing at all.

The villa was tastefully furnished and clean. The villa had everything we needed from kitchen utensils, appliances, "
"Die Casa Talavera befindet sich im Herzen von Isla Mujeres, man ist sehr schnell am Markt oder in den Restaurants. Das Zimmer 1 fand ich schön und praktisch eingerichtet, sowohl die Klimaanlage wie auch der Ventilator funktionieren tadellos. Und im Korridor hat es einen Wasserspender, der ist Gold wert. Vom Balkon aus kann man das Treiben in den Gassen beobachten, bevor man aus dem Haus geht. "

I ate at the Kalak hotel restaurant almost daily. The coffee is amazing, great food, and the staff was so nice and even helped me with my Spanish since I am learning! Can't wait to come back. Alejandra and the entire Kalak staff were awesome."

We prefer smaller family  Owned and operated hotels with their own distinctive atmosphere and Las Palmas is the absolute best on so many levels!  The staff are welcoming and genuine—they make you feel like family and are there to help!  The rooms are very well equipped with top quality comfortable beds and beautiful bedding.  The location is absolutely ideal!, 4 "

However, we canceled several of our dining out plans after we sampled the cooking of the villa's personal chef - Abraham is extraordinarily talented and it was a pleasure to have him cook for us.  Private breakfasts are included in the cost of the rentals and the add-on cost for other meals is more than reasonable.  All in all, our family could not be happier with our week at Casa Lola.

There is a beach club next door and we worried when we seen the catamarans pulling in full of a crowd and although there is a sign sta"

As always, Ashley and Curtis had the property in tip top shape and the service was impeccable. From Ashley's warm welcome to Curtis' scrumptious breakfasts, every detail was a winner! The past year was exhausting and there was no better place to rest, relax and recharge than camped out by the pool with an excellent marga"
Showed up here with my sailboat 46 foot beneteau once I was tied up I came face-to-face with the owner witch is absolutely rude.He then went on to ask me if we had rented a room and that if not I would need to leave...the fact that we were ready to spend money at his restaurant and paid for a dock for overnight didn't seem enough for him. I don't recommend this place don't want to encourage this type of behavior from an owner!

There was hot water in the shower. I was provided a large bottle of drinkable water since I stayed for the week and could not drink the tap water. Corner balcony was perfect for enjoying the waves, sun, boats in the distance and view of distant Cancun. Maids were friendly and efficient. Other than relentless mosquitos I had no other bugs. T"
" 5 p.m.) Renting a golf cart is a great investment and made exploring the island, hanging out at all the remote beach sites and eating at the fun places in the north shore or central island a breeze and very enjoyable. This hotel advertises that they are next to the Garrison Park and share the same reef for snorkeling but that is not exactly right. It cost $39 to snorkel the reef which is actually roped off from this hotel and government operated with admission through the park.  They will whistle you out! "
"I never write reviews but after the experience I had here I felt compelled to share my experience.   If you're travelling alone don't stay here! Alex, the owner, just wants to make as much money as he possibly can from you. He asked me to stay in a room down the road from the hotel in the backyard of what looked like a rubbish dump.

"We went back to this hotel in December, a few years after our first visit.  The beach and view are still a plus, but there were more problems. We, too, encountered the red ants mentioned in another review, although we changed rooms (to the side closer to the cafe) and didn't have a further problem. Breakfast is no longer included and is now hard to get, since no restaurants within walking distance are open early. Staff is friendly, and they seem to be working on some needed repairs to the buildings."

"We had always stayed in North Beach, but wanted a change. We were so glad that we found Villa La Bella. Wow!! Everything was perfect and we will stay here every time we visit Isla. Ashley and Curtis are perfect hosts with a wealth of knowledge. They treat you like family and were so much fun to talk to daily. The pool, the view, the shell shower, the drinks, the breakfast were all perfection. I could write a whole review on the breakfast and the coffee. Curtis is quite the chef and we looked forward to that"
This hotel was cheap and very central. We found our room to be a good size but dingy and in desperate need of painting. The bed was well used and lacking in comfort. The bathroom was a good size and had plenty of hot water. The passageways had cleaning brooms and mops piled in corners and gave an un-kept look to the hotel. The central walls had large patches of black mould on them where water dripped. The central garden vegetation was sparse and the area was often used to store garbage before being disposed
"This is a great, centrally based hotel with welcoming and obliging staff. It's no frills, but quite adequate and above all, clean.  However, we had a bad experience with the Tours and Info Bureau attached to the hotel.   The day before we were due to leave we purchased a pre-paid taxi from Pt. Jaurez to Cancun airport. Unfortunately, the taxi never arrived and we had no means of contacting the agent  (despite having a receipt, there was no telephone contact number). We were forced to take another taxi to th"

We left our bags in the room and then took a cab (quite a drive, almost 10 km from the town) in to town. When we got back in the evening (after another long cab drive) we inspected our room more carefully. Well, it was nothing great - a typical early 80'ies decoration, but it seemed clean. When getting in to bed I found a ded ""dried up"" ant, but I thought nothing of it... bugs can get in s"
So close you can hear the party from the nearby strip so this has pros and cons of course. The a/c just about kept us cool... not sure if it was working well. Bonus TV and DVD player and nice big bed. Poor shower stream and not the nicest bathroom.

This place is run down.  They list the rooms for $20 on their sign and all you get is a bed.  There is no hot water, no air conditioning, nothing but a bed.  Whomever is posting these current reviews is not being honest.  It is really sad that someone would try to cheat people coming to this beautiful island.  Do not sta"
We absolutely loved this place and the owners. Never felt more at home so quickly during a vacation. Breakfasts were absolutely amazing and the advise and service was top notch at all times. We stayed in Palapa 2 and it too gave us a full island experience while still having a wonderful view. We will be back and fully recommend staying here to our friends.
"We liked this place alot. The staff are very nice and friendly and they look after the hotel well with high care and standards. Perfect wifi, nice balcony bit, good location. The price is the best we could find on the island. Don't book ahead on Mujeres, just come have a look round yourself, you'll get a better budget deal. Also, the rooms are so cool on the third floor, we didn't even need the fan on much! "
I absolutely love this place! I am a member and try to get to the Mia at least once per year. Miguel made our stay so much fun! Views and the beach are stunning. All services are excellent! Highly recommend!

The location is really great! 2 streets away from all restaurants and shops. Playa Norte (the sunset is AMAZING) is less than 5 minutes away or 1 minute away with a golf cart. I really enjoyed my one night stay at Casa Naranja. Might be noisy for people older people but at the end of the day I will recommand this place. 
"We had a room at the back but we were the whole night really bothered by the noise on the street. If you want a restful sleep choose something else. So we wanted to move as quickly as possible and fortunately the owner did not fuss about it. Well we had lost the 15% that goes to Hostelworld. On the Internet I did not find affordable accommodation but when we were there, there were plenty of cheap hotels."
"I have visited Isla Mujeres 3 times prior to this last visit. This time, we were going to stay for 10 days. The first 5 days we stood in Hotel Cabanas Maria Del Mar in Playa Norte. We were with a group of friends, so the location was perfect. One day, we were driving around the island an came upon the floating house. Directly in front of it was Villas Hi Na Ha. We decided to look around. The grounds were gorgeous as were the rooms! We decided that for our last 5 days on the island we would stay there. This "

Daytime temps were around 28 celcius so hot evenings weren't a problem. Although the room was clean it was a little dated with faded paint and paint chips in the wall. Electrical switches and outlets were about 50 years old. Shower head was rusted, there was warm water, mirror was faded and tough to see my reflection when shaving. No safe in t"

"I stayed at Hotel Osorio for 4 nights, it is situated very close in walking distance to the ferry harbor and also to the main street of Isla Mujeres.   There are two types of rooms available, with or without AC. As the hotel was almost fully booked and I didn't place a reservation beforehand the only choice I got was a double room without AC but with a ceiling fan, which was 300 Pesos per night. The room was situated on the floor above the reception. It is very spacious, not very clean but not dirty either "
" close to the main street so you might hear some noise from (most likely) drunken people passing by. One night I was seriously bothered by a group of guests from the hotel who came home around 5 o'clock in the morning and kept partying in front of their rooms. The following nights there were no disturbances whatsoever..  Overall I think it is a good budget place to stay, especially for backpackers. If you plan to be outside most of the time and don't expect a cozy hotel but more of a hostel it will be alrig"

"Isla Mujeres is a beautiful beach, with almost perfect views, the atmosphere is excellent to rest and get out of the routine.  It is a place that you can visit with your family and the costs are affordable.  One of the best beaches in Mexico"
"Beautiful beaches. Nice town. Nice to walk around and buy hand  craft or souvenirs.  My first time was amazing.  This time we went there for 5 days for the Holy week (Semana Santa) and honestly too many people everywhere. So, if you want to get a tour it was longer because was a lot of people. Service and food was not good as well."
"We arrived at the IMP on 9/11/2021 after a horrible wait for a ferry . We were told that the IMP boat would be picking us up . However , when we arrived at the airport , we were taken to a ferry where we waited over two hours to go to the hotel . Upon arrival , we were told our room wasn’t ready , but the hotel was going to upgrade us free of charge . The first day we noticed a charge on the credit card for 620.00  and immediately called the front desk . The front desk said it was a mistake and that it woul"
" charged us 630.00 for the room upgrade that we were told was free  . It has been horrible since that day . We filed a fraud claim dispute . The hotel sent a receipt after 6 months to the credit card company showing we signed for the charges for the room upgrade . The only problem is that the date is wrong , all three signatures they supplied don’t match , and the room number is wrong . The Palace Resorts have yet to refund our money back .  Th ey should refund the money back and apologize . We already had "

"Once again another tremendous Palace experience. It is what we have come to expect from Palace and they have again made our vacation a memory for a lifetime.  Although they consistently provide excellent food and beverage, clean comfortable facilities and lots of available activities, it is the staff and the service they provide that truly make the difference for us. Our DC Fermin did an incredible job tending to our needs and planned a beautiful special dinner for us under the palapa on the pier as we enjo"

We enjoyed several spa experiences from massages to manicures & pedicures all at the amazing talents of Natividad & Carmen who provided a tranquil setting to display their skilful abilities.😇😌 Palace should be proud of the wonderful team they have put together at Isla Mujeres Palace. As this particular resort has been sold effective April 1st, we would like to extend our best wishes and continued success"

My favorite time of the day was Morning awaiting the amazing welcoming from Juan, Christian, Macedonio and Paolo.... Last time we were there was right before covid Paolo coul"
"Having experienced a number of organised trips in Mexico, I knew to expect some level of shortfall on delivered service. Overselling is pretty much the norm here.   Decided last minute to book a catamaran trip to the Isla Mujeres.   For those who snorkelled, Great experience and really well managed by boat crew.   The island is what you would expect two stops, one at a market that would suit people that want to barter and get a deal for local trinkets. Frankly the prices quoted were 4 or 5 times what you wo"

" to my taste.   Wasn’t that impressed with the ad hoc swim with shark attraction, advert in how not to look after wildlife.   Trip back was uneventful with a nice breeze, great for topping up tan.   The end of this trip was a debacle with boat crew more interested in securing their tips, they were great to be fair and earned them, than telling us how to find our taxi back to resort. One tour guide was trying to help dealing with around 300 passengers most of which walked past the meeting point for taxis, wh"
"The location of this hotel on isla mujeres cannot be beat. The rooms are nice sized and clean, with private balconies. Cleaning staff did an excellent job every day. The decor is minimal, perhaps not the bohemian vibe that some travelers look for. But we loved it and are going back again over Easter"

"Very nice place to stay. Very quiet at night, not sure about during the day, wasn’t in room much during the day. Excellent location, right on the beach, close to everything. Very clean throughout the resort. Beach bathroom very clean every time I used it. Plenty of loungers and good service to help you set up for the day. Food service on beach was good as was the food. Plenty of other places near by to eat if you want to change it up. Very close to Hildalgo  street for shopping and restaurants and entertain"
The best place and buttifull  small Ilene happy 😃 people were very impressed by this place  The beaches was clean and unique  White sand   Bat everything is close at 24:00 pm Privilege resort was very good and all exclusive was perfect 👌
"The Maria Del Mar was one of the most beautiful places to stay at. The cabana's, pool, restaurant, and staff were all incredible. The staff is what made our trip! There was always someone around willing to help out/bring anything you need. Donovan, the general manager, went absolutely out of his way to ensure our stay was perfect. Cannot say enough amazing things about this hotel and can't wait to return back soon!"
"we just returned from another lovely stay at Playa Arena.......and returned happy again... there are lots of small and lovely touches like filtered water, fresh coffee set ups, and wine glasses.... appreciate the great hot water and the super clean rooms.... we will be back!"
Great spot to stay. Traveled the area a lot and by far the coldest room ever. Free breakfast is a nice add. Good location to all of north beach and nice staff. Clean rooms and nice grounds. Only drawback is a very small pool that’s upstairs. Very small like a plunge pool. Other than that top notch.
"if you want to get a genuin adventure, take a look at the tshirt on the picture and contact them, the have a little wooden boat, not so nice but they are fantastic people. You go snorkling among fishes you only see in an aquarium... They are polite and speak some english. if you are brave enough to get out of the box on your vacation..?price is good too!"
One of the most beautiful beaches that I have ever been to. In my opinion better than the Maldives.  The north end of the island you can walk out 80 meters and still only be thigh deep.the beach bar at this beach was very good value for money and the food was nice.best way to travel the island is by hiring a golf cart.the ferry crossing from cancun to here was 19 us dollars. Well worth a visit.
"The location was absolutely beautiful and the hotel itself was very clean. I would say that overall the best thing was the staff. The concierge, Donovan, went above and beyond, he is so friendly and helpful. He made the experience that much better for me and my friends. The rest of the staff was so great as well, there was always someone to help when we needed it whether that meant booking an excursion or recommending a restaurant.  I couldn't recommend this place more! I will definitely be going back."
"Great experience at Playa Arena overall. Stayed 3 nights following a stay at Nautibeach next door so we were able to experience both accommodation types in one of the mist beautiful beaches in Mexico. To summarize here are the pros and cons per our experience:  Pros: Clean, allowed early check in, steps away from the beach, complimentary breakfast, tropical property ambiance, affordable price, helpful beach bar staff  Cons: Poor staff follow up to room issue (had us wait and never returned to room to inform"
"The Marina here is very tranquil and lined with beautiful vessels anchored from everywhere in the world.  Docked here in front of the Isla Mujeres Yacht Club & World Mark Resort is the Famous ""Boardwalk"" Yacht .  What an incredible luxurious vessel to view from our room!"
"If you’re looking for a top notch place to stay- look no further. Close to all the main attractions, you get the best of both worlds with upbeat attractions and the quietness to enjoy. From everything to the Staff, location, amenities, location you are getting nothing short of an A+ experience. Thank you to Donovan for the great help and customer service. We will be back again! 🇲🇽"
"My family of 4 (two 15 year old boys) rented Marino Pescador 1 for the twins and Mi Secreta 2 for myself and my husband.    The accommodations at Playa Arena are good, but don't be expecting anything fancy, y'all. What this place delivers on is AMAZING BEACHFRONT ACCESS and small resort charm.  I feel badly ranking them a ""4"" because they have such a strong 4.5, but the resort has some flaws.  Pros: Mi Secreta is not just beachfront - it is ON THE BEACH. Check out the photos below to see what I am talking a"

Beds and pillows are decent.  AC is strong and cold!   The lunch we had there was also very good.  Drinks are reasonable priced.   Marino Pescador 1 was larger than Mi Secreta and had better kitchen outfitting.

Awesome journey filled with scuba diving and awesome people great food relaxing four hour  cruise. Crew members were funny and entertaining highly recommend this for the next trip. The next trip with the all the extra activities we couldn't of asked for anything else 
"If I could give more stars to this resort, I would.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, we were met with genuine, kind, attentive (but not fawning or overwhelming) staff.  The concierge,  Donovan, was just a great guy who is very experienced but also with a genuine sense of humor that put us at ease immediately. I noticed the constant, thorough attention the staff paid to keeping the pool area pristine all day.  They made a very strong, consistent effort at keeping the algea (build up due to "

The ferry ride was very relaxing and fast. Some restaurants were clean some others not so much. It's pretty chill there. The beach is nice. Ppl are nice. Not much to do. Just walk or rent a gold cart to get around. It's busy so be prepared to see a lot of people walking around. The weather was nice mid 70's-80's a bit windy but very nice. I recommend to bring (pesos) way cheaper that way. 
"Great hotel, friendly and attentive staff. Food and drinks were good. Consierge Donovan was very helpful and helped us book an excursion to Chichén Itzá which was awesome. The pool was great since the beach was all covered with seaweed. Would definitely stay at Maria del Mar again. "
"I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of April. This is a small hotel tucked in between Nautibeach and Ixchel directly on Playa Norte. It's hidden under palm trees so there is a lot of shade. I stayed in La Carta room #2 above the lobby. It was a small room, with shower and balcony. It had a microwave, mini fridge/freezer, toaster, coffee maker, and large bottle of water. The air conditioner has a remote control so you can adjust the temp yourself! The only negatives on this room were that the bed and pillo"
"Helpful, friendly staff.  Clean well kept facilities. Beautiful grounds. Highly recommend.  Close to shopping, and beaches. Staff speak English and you will find English widely spoken in Isla. Wonderful restaurants, reasonably priced."
"Amazing hotel, wonderful and helpful staff, perfect location. Strongly recommend Maria Del Mar. it’s a little paradise. For fun or just to relax it’s the perfect place. We didn’t a week during April. The restaurant is also super great."
" included. Let the front desk know if you need new towels or your room cleaned. The breakfast was excellent. You could have eggs, beans, potatoes, toast, coffee, pancakes, fruit etc, with the most breathtaking view.Valentin will take excellent care of you at the restaurant/bar/beach. Staying here gives you access to lounge chairs, umbrella, and table with fantastic beach service from Alejandro and Valentin. This is my favorite part of the beach since the chairs are not so bunched up together. You can rent a"
Stayed with two other families in March 2022. The location is great off the main noisiest part of Tulum beach but close enough to walk to the shops and restaurants. Beach area is great with many shaded areas. But the staff is what makes this place great. Carlos and Franco at the restaurant are great. The owner is on site and makes sure everything runs properly.  Would definitely return .

"I’m typically very generous with 5 star ratings if I’ve had a pleasant experience and this was indeed very pleasant but I can’t go higher than 4 stars as it wasn’t “prestine” all around which I expected considering the price.  We had booked one of the pricier options for roughly 550 USD a night and at such a price I expect everything to be otherworldly, maybe that’s unfair so read my review in that light.   The pros: * gorgeous view - I mean just look at the photo. * great room - excellent indeed except for"
"The loud music every day is ANNOYING. It’s just too Loud!! Boom boom! Why does it have to be that loud? Not to mention your choice sucks. Sorry… just sayin…so you nope, guests staying at neighboring properties want to hear the ocean. Clubs like this are what are ruining the tranquility of Tulum."
" restaurant collaborate but with only 16-20ish rooms you expect peace and quiet but instead the hotel/pool/outside area can some days be “invaded” by  guests from outside the hotel who buy a single beer and then establish their own party right next to you when all you want is to enjoy the nature and relax. Considering the price per night, I’d expect the hotel/restaurant to keep that as the main priority. We saw this on more than one of the days and that is a major “con” for me given the purpose I had with m"
"We loved the vibe of this place, people working at Dos Ceibas were very friendly and welcoming (the lady at the reception, Claudia and the other Italian girl(sorry, forgot her name) all so kind and helpful). Loved the Temazcal experience and the Cacao ceremony.  Nice, clean and spacious room."
"Came here to enjoy a beach/ocean front suite with a private outdoor area complete with a hammock and indoor/outdoor lounging areas, your feet on the sand just off your room. The beach was free of sargassum and maintained daily. Front desk and restaurant service was excellent and the included breakfast was delicious. One of the best ceviches, guacamole and mixology. Location is ideal, walkable to restaurants."

"this hotel is heaven on earth.  a private and great beach, great food and the best staff in the world. First of all - management - Orfe.  She was always there for any of our questions and requests.  Marcellino in the service - best man ;) the plants on the hotel are a big deal.  Golden hands and lots of love here.  We will be back!!!"
"We stayed at Alma for a girls trip - our own version of a 20 year college reunion. The staff at Alma were wonderful. We especially enjoyed our breakfast every morning. It was so nice to be welcomed with a yummy breakfast which was included with our stay. Carlos, one of the restaurant waiters, went above and beyond in providing us the best travel tips, helped us coordinate transportation and cenote passes while we were having breakfast. Everyone at the front desk is lovely and responded to our needs quickly."
We planned a trip with some friends to stay at this resort and decided to cancel months ago at the height of the omicron variant when cases were very high. I have yet to receive my refund for my room. The staff seems very disorganized and I guess they just pocketed my deposit which was a couple of hundred dollars. I hate to write a bad review but I just hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else.
" other local hotels restaurants.   Muchas gracias a todos en Alma por su servicio, especialmente Carlos, Gabriel, las muchachas de conserje, y Dayana."
"We had an issue with our room and they really went out of their way to make up for the issue . Definitely recommend  this place, the staff are great and the breakfast and shrimp tacos are amazing. Claudia was a great host and I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.  "

The hotel was very in theme with tulum. Rustic idyllic pretty lagoon  pool. FRANC"
"I previously wrote a review for Dos Ceibas and we decided to go back this year since we had such an amazing time last year. I even decided to propose to my partner there! The room, food, and beach access were all perfect. I really cannot think of anything I would change about this property. It is like a home away from home. Before going, I was able to get in touch with one of the bartenders I met last year (Ivan Lopez). He went above and beyond this job title to help me plan the most epic marriage proposal."
" Overall Very serviceable.   We had some issues with the A/C but once we told them (the 2nd crew ~nice young man with a beard) they took care of it. The shower flooded a bit but once we told them they resolved it. It was as simple as moving the black rocks decorating the drain to fix it.  cleaning crew- nice replenished towels etc.  Everyone went out of their way, minus one lady, that I would say really made the stay an amazing one.   Even with the A/C and the shower (which could happen anywhere it’s how th"

$450 a night for a hotel with a giant cockroach in the bathroom and a beach that’s covered in seaweed. The cockroach is not a jungle pest that should be tolerated. It means the pipes under the sink aren’t sealed so it allows bugs in the room. The pillows are also pretty cheap for a hotel this expensive. All that plus every restaurant in the area seems like $200 for two to have dinner. Not for me thanks.  I’m never coming back. I have asked to leave the hotel and they will not refund me for the remainder of 
"Our group didn’t stay at this hotel, but we were guests of the beach club two days in a row because it was that great! It’s a little off from the party/clubby beach clubs which we liked because we could generally relax and have a beach day. The staff and service was great and the food was even better. They have one of the lower minimums of guests, which is easily met with a drink and a meal. By far the best pina colada I’ve ever had!"
We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel area is just amazing with a direct beach access. They have a cocktail bar as well. They served one of the best margaritas I‘ve ever had. Ivan the barkeeper was so nice and helpful. We can highly recommand this hotel.
"Very poor experience, constant power outages, salty tap water. Mini fridge and air conditioning do not work. Managers avoiding us. Beach is full of weeks old trash and seaweed, insects and bats living in smelly seaweed, plastic bottles and dirty plastic bags flying around. Wifi breaks down. Constant sounds of drilling concrete. I could not charge my phone, could not shower for 5 days, could not flush the toilet because no water and had to dress in complete darkness."
"I Stayed at Maya Tulum Resort for 3 nights, the staff were very helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We had a  room on the beach which was clean, pleasant and effect for listening to the waves at night.  The best part of this hotel has to be the white sand beach with  cabañas and hammocks to chill on. The hotel has a beach bar service I found the drinks to be over priced but after spending a few days in Tulum I Soon realised they were a fair price  for the area.

At night turtles come to lay their eggs, the hotel protects the nests until the babies hatch, Cabanas are top notch, comfortable, air conditioned, clean, enough space.

It was like in the pictures. and its near by the main road in Tulum City. Nice people and very helpfully in all situation. We recomand ! The street its under repair but looks like will be done this season. We recomand to follow staff recomandation for trips and rentals.
" We ate at Kiguri, their Japanese restaurant, our last night in which I had the best tonkatsu of my life!!!! Shout out to Andres (waiter), Edward and Genaro (reception), and Enrique  (security) which made Justin and me feel like family. We can't wait to return to Pocna!"
100% recommend staying here! The property is kept very clean and the staff is amazing I felt welcomed and comfortable. Daily breakfast is nothing fancy but it's made fresh and delicious. Pool side view😍
"We used the Habitas beach club as day guests. View was lovely, they had a beach team cleaning up the seaweed however it was a constant build up so the ocean view pool came in very handy! The did reserve this close seating area for guests but wasn’t an issue as lots of other seating options.   Food was nice in the restaurant, decor was stylish. We were told we had to have a minimum consumption spend of $100 USD per person but actually wasn’t required once you were in"

There are not many rooms in the hotel (maybe 10maximum) which makes the swimming pool highly available for yourself and the hotel is not noisy at all which is perfect for relaxing.

Just what was needed.    The whole place is surrounded by a concrete wall that’s about 10’ tall and has two wooden doors that are locked at night.

The entire stay is truly an experience, starting from the greeting and welcome - you are emerged in a quiet jungle, on the beach with wellness as a top priority. The restaurant, Moro, has incredible and fresh meals, elixirs, and beverages. At first, we were bummed that Habitas is about a 5-10 minute cab ride from the heart of Tulum beach, but honestly after spending a day down "
For the price it was a good stay. There was no microwave and the water went out on our stay for several hours but the tried to Compensate with wine. The continental breakfast was was good and the pool was clean as well.

The staff was amazing and went above and beyond to accommodate my friends and I. Mariana was the best host we could have ever asked for and made sure we were taken care of! She would call taxis for us and even planned some of our daily/tour activities. She was truly the best!! We had the penthouse which was spacious, included a kitchen with a fridge, super clean, and the view outside the"
" hotel for our travel back to the U.S, and had great recommendations for where to eat, where to go, etc. We truly felt taken care of the entire time. We also ate at the restaurant Tatewari several times during our stay and the food and view were great. We really loved the location as well. It’s in the hotel zone, but the hotel itself doesn’t have a club in it, so it was like the best of both worlds. We enjoyed being able to go hang out in the party restaurants and come back to a quiet hotel. Any convenience"
…
"We loved our stay at Villas H2O.  This was our first time Tun Tulum but we were shocked that the hotel zone was so chaotic and packed - maybe a factor fo a COVID and all of the influencers and digital nomads being there - but regardless, we were glad to be in a quiet hotel a little bit apart from the hustle and bustle.  The rooms are minimalist and lovely, with excellent AC, fans, and screened doors to keep cool.  The beds were comfortable and shampoo/ soaps high end.  The room was dark and silent at night."
…
"A hidden gem, on the beach, located close enough to the main strip but cabs to/from are expensive. Hotel staff all very polite, helpful and pleasant.  Loved the WhatsApp group. Loved the activities on offer which once can partake or not. No pressure. Good mix of clientele and restaurant serves the most delicious food."
"This really is a wonderful hotel in the perfect location!   The rooms are really beautiful, comfortable and well sized. They provide you all the amenities you would need to have a great stay. The coffee delivered to the room and the late night cookies are so cute!   The restaurant on site is also really great. The food, drinks and prices are better than a lot of other options around Tulum beach which is very convenient.  Fernando at the front desk is a star, so helpful and informative! Definitely a great as"
"I stayed in this hotel in November 2021 and contacted them right away when me and my cousin noticed there were lots of over charges from Kimpton Aluna Tulum Hotel on the credit card. They have not tried to clear it up, instead, they blame the credit card. The credit card did a whole review and concluded that its the hotel that did the charges, therefore, they have to return my money back. They are not calling me back, nor sending me an email. Im very frustrated with their service and now I have to waste my "
"Habitas is a truly special place. Quality food, service, rooms & everything. Blooming brilliant find. Loved the sandy walkway through the jungle to arrive in the communal spaces. Showing with the the sunshine, or moonlight was unforgettable. And watching sunrise from the balcony over the ocean, or from our bed was special as heck. We'd love to go back. "
La Valise was better than we even expected. The facilities were top notch. The food and drinks were incredible. But the people and service at La Valise really set it apart from other locations. This is the best place to stay in Tulum. I couldn't recommend it enough.
" bugs in the room that chirp and whistle all night too, so if you’re a light sleeper it’s something to definitely keep in mind!   Overall I had an amazing stay and would recommend it to anyone!"
" este hotel en noviembre del 2021. Cuando yo y mi primo vimos que nos avian cobrado mas de mil dólares mas de lo que tenían que cobrarnos, me comunique con ellos. Hice muchísimas llamadas y ellos no an tratado de resolverme el problema. Ahora tengo que gastar mi tiempo en reportarlos. CUIDADO EN USAR TARJETA DE CREDITO CON ELLOS. El hotel esta lindo pero desafortunadamente me hicieron fraude."
"I stayed an entire week at Habitas, as a solo traveler looking to unwind, get closer to myself, but also to be in a place where I would have the opportunity to meet some others.   This is an incredible hotel. I notice some negative reviews here from people who showed up for dinner only - I was here a full week. There is yoga every morning, and a really good sound therapy which you must try, and generally some sort of rotating / mindfulness thing in the evening. All were great.   The thing I liked about it t"
"My wife and I just celebrated our honeymoon at La Valise and can't say enough about this beautiful property and the wonderful people that work here. Emily and Josefina at the Concierge desk were absolutely on point with helping us set up airport transport, restaurant reservations, scooter rental, in-room/beach/pool dining and every other aspect of our trip that made our stay absolutely seamless. The property itself is breathtaking and unlike anywhere else we have ever stayed. You feel like you are staying i"

"Not even 1 star !!!!   This company is a complete FRAUD.  They are the middle man and keep all the money themselves, will not speak to customers, will not provide ANY solutions to the problem and DO NOT offer any refunds for bad accommodations.   During Spring Break - April 4-9 2022.  We booked 3 bedroom Villa in Tulum, Casa Ganesh and had concerns of the music next door prior to arrival.  Our travel agent through Smartflyer, found this villa through Journeys Mexico - who we paid, however we didn't realize "

"When we found the hotel we were greeted warmly and well looked after. The rooms are amazing and right on the beach…literally! Rustic and fantastic, with a hammock outside on the terrace. The staff are very friendly and Eduardo looked after us well for breakfast 🙏 there was a nice breeze coming from the ocean which was cooling and pleasant when sitting in the open restaurant or on the beach.    Great stay 🙏"
 this amazing place and the people who run it. Thank you so much!
"I can’t say enough about this place. It’s a hidden gem. To provide some context, I’m a Ritz Carlton platinum member so I love luxury hotels. I was a bit nervous about hotel beforehand. Now, I can attest the experience at Delek was as enjoyable as any Ritz or Four Seasons. It’s important to understand that at Tulum, you’re here to relax, eat good Mexican food, enjoy the beach, and party at clubs. The only reason Delek is not rated higher is because they don’t have their own pool, gym, etc. However, Delek is "

We were told Tulum is famous for bars and nightlife, but this is a completely different experience.  At the Villa, which we paid $1500/night, we had NO Air Conditioning in the Master Bed and No Air in the main living area.  The hotel GM that the property is attached to was wonderful.  He apologized, treated us to lunch and provided their portion of the refund.  He sai"
"We had really been looking forward yo our holiday at this Kimpton - the hotel rooms were lovely but the whole experience was marred by the staff which is unusual for a Kimpton.  The Front Desk team up until 4pm were misleading and unhelpful, even check in was a chore.  The later afternoon team were better.  The service in the restaurant was slow (20 minutes to get the free coffee in the morning) and inherently sexist by responding to questions asked by me (female) to my partner and only speaking to him.

"We arrived and I was instantly impressed by how beautiful it was! The server Isai was great! He told us about all the deals and was not wrong about how great the mango margarita was. The guacamole is really good. Very herby and fresh. Thanks to Jorge, Felix and Evi at the bar. They know what they’re doing."

" all we wanted, and then escape back to Delek within seconds away. The best part here is the staff… they bent over backwards for us. Fernando at front desk/concierge set up everything needed for Tulum partygoer… he knew all the places to visit, restaurants, etc. From the beginning, he gave me his cell and was accessible from the first hour. I bothered him about everything and he was super patient and helpful. What was super scary was that my girlfriend and I were injured riding a scooter (my fault) and the "

"We love the Aluna hotel. It's a boutique hotel that focuses on the human connection.   A personalized gift was waiting for us in our room; a hand-crafted gourmet chocolate camera. I was blown away by the attention to detail they paid to create this one-of-a-kind experience for us. The room had the right amount of minimalism and warmth. The staff is truly unique. Kathleen, Stephan, and Rogelio were incredibly generous with their time. The Bhanu restaurant is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. For dinner, we pl"
The Hip Hotel is gorgeous! The rooms are right on the beach and have a rustic feel which we love.  All the staff is very friendly. Especially Eduardo who served us breakfast. Food in general is delicious here.  I highly recommend a stay here!
"We have rarely had such a fantastic stay as at La valise. They helped us to arrange a marriage proposal down to the last detail and it was beyond amazing. The place, the rooms but above all the team at La valise that take service to another level. An absolute must for those going to Tulum. It doesn’t get any better!"

"Stayed here for a week the first part of April 2022. It's very close to many good restaurants and shops and felt it was centrally located.  The first two nights we stayed on the lower level close to the entrance and it was a little to loud at night bc the club next door has loud music till 1am. My friend and i are 53 and don't stay up that late anymore lol. As soon as I mentioned possibly changing room further away, instantly they took care of it and was moved closer to the beach and on the upper level. It "

The hotel offers bike hire which is included. The rooms were a great size always cleaned and it felt nice coming back to after a long day out. The staff at the hotel are very knowledgeable and offered great recommendations of places to go and eat, In particular Art and Sergio.

Wonderful restaurant with excellent service and yummy food. Abraham and Eduardo were very welcoming and helpful. The view is breathtaking. We stayed at the hotel and all the staff were very nice and kind
"This hotel lived up to everything it promised and I had hoped for!  At the heart of this place are the amazing staff. A big thank you to the concierge team, Josefina, Iker, JP and a big thank you to Emily who went out of her way to help me with a last minute purchase. Plus all the other staff who took the time to remember our names, whether delivering breakfast, another Margarita or turning our bedroom into a birthday delight or towel animals! If you go here I hope you get to meet the same team as we did.  "
Amazing service.  Best day in Tulum. Jordan was a great server. The food was so great.   Cerviche.  Yummy. Everything was so good when joyed it so much drink service everything it was amazing will be back and suggest all our friends to come here. It was awesome
 close to any activity we wanted and even just to relax on the beach. I would give this place a 10/10.
"Great service, they changed our room because the neighbour upstairs had a baby and it was noisy, the rooms are nice clean and calm, loads of space. Different pools and areas in the hotel + the restaurant service is amazing, you really feel special.   Special thanks to Mario from the restaurant, really nice person."
"This was the second time my husband and have been here. Last time we came in February 2020 before the pandemic, so we were so excited to get back. I love the rooms, and the service is wonderful, especially Eduardo and Abraham. It’s very friendly and peaceful. No loud party vibes. Good food for a hotel and delicious fresh juice and fruit every breakfast included!"
" walking for fun and liveliness or retreat back to peace and quiet. But it’s a 15 min walk to the middle of the busy patch, so you can end up a little sweaty arriving for dinner.  Can’t recommend this place enough."

"Our first time to Tulum for my birthday and the Sundream festival.  Staying at the Aluna Kimpton was the perfect hotel for a magical week.  We can't say enough about the staff at this Kimpton, they were so friendly and hard working, we felt like they became friends and we look forward to another trip there again. Traveling is a privilege and the staff you meet are welcoming you into their home environment, travelers need to be respectful and appreciate the experience. The hotel is beautifully designed, open"
Lovely view and wonderful service from Abraham and Giovanna. Dinner was accommodating for our vegan preferences.  Nice breeze coming in through the sliding doors and beach sounds were peaceful.  Vegan Caesar was good as well as the vegan pizza.
"Great service. More than happy! Ronaldo, Darinel, Irlanda and Ángel treated us amazing! Great food, drinks and vibes. If you come to tulum make sure to visit HIP hotel, you won’t find a better service at an excelente price in tulum."

I don’t love writing reviews like this as I know they damage a hotels future business.  But unless you are heading to Tulum to club every night until 4am this hotel is not for you.  We thought we were staying in a cool chilled beach pad. But there was nothing chilled about it.  The thumping house music from Rosanegra next door blared from 11am until 4am! It was relentless.   Even with ear plugs I could hear every word and could feel the music as it shook my body with the base.  It was relentless and exhaust
" and the ""green power juice""!!  And one morning they had a fantastic warm tomato soup, I've never had soup at breakfast but it was so good I couldn't resist.  There is a rooftop pool and restaurant and both were a treat to discover.  The cabanas up there at night were so peaceful and taking a nap under the stars was amazing.  The restaurant Bhanu and the chef were great. Other great things:  craft cocktail & snacks daily at 5pm, free bikes to get to town & beach, towels & bag to go to Maia Beach Club-  A Mu"
"Best service in the area !  great food ., friendly staff! Amazing view!! Super clean rooms  Thank you Eduardo , Aimar !! Yoshira , Meche and all security ! Safe amazing place with family and friends,  See you all soon"
What an amazing experience!  This hotel is so beautiful- completely natural surroundings with only 11 rooms. It is set right on the ocean. Our room was a hut that was spectacularly decorated and had an outside shower. As beautiful as the hotel is the best part about it is the staff. They are young and beautiful but so great at their job. They knew our names the whole time and made every thing run smoothly. They even negotiated the cab price before we got in.  Breakfast on the front deck looking at the ocean
 was hot and pressure ok.   Nobody asked us when we left if we’d enjoyed our stay: I assume our bloodshot eyes and exhausted demeanour told them the answer.   I would never stay again.

"We (fanily of 4) stayed here in a beachfront king double room which was just sublime. We had access to the terrance pool and could have food in the privacy and shade on our balcony. The Sea wind was a gift from nature as it gets very hot on the jungle side of the resort.  We attended various yoga sessions, healing ceremonies from the shalla and even clay paint on the beach it was all spectacular  Massive mention goes to Bernie and the other staff on the terrace, nothing was a problem and they were only too "
"I stumbled upon BeTulum over ten years ago for lunch and swore I would stay here one day. I’m a designer and the property and the rooms are so amazing. It is epic design in harmony with nature. It appears so effortless but I know all the effort it took.   We had room 28, an Aire Master Suite. It is closest to the left common pool on the trail. It is a second floor living room, master bedroom and private terrace with a staircase to a private rooftop terrace with its own soaking pool, lounge and netted suspen"
Was very nice! Delicious juices and coffee. The views on the beach and the ocean are super beautiful. We were here only for a drink but the fish and tequila looked very appealing too for later in the day. Our server Eduardo was great :)
 that easy to get to but this hotel and staff made it completely worth it. We will be back!
"This hotel was incredible. The location is perfect, walking distance to the main hot spots and popular restaurants. Having access to the other Ahau hotels was also a great benefit.   We stayed in a superior room which was modern and extremely clean. Really good value for money compared to other hotels located on the beach. The staff were super helpful and friendly, going out of their way to make our stay so fantastic. 24 hour security also meant we felt safe throughout our stay.  Other reviews mention the m"
" excellent, things from the bar are on the pricey end of things but for beach frontage service can you really complain.  The Sea swimming was incredible, quite powerfull and mindfull experience. I didnt mind the sea weed which is a major issue in Tulum.  I would go back to Amansala in the morning"

" room, blow dryer, shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, moisturizer, water, etc. There are plenty of outlets available and no converter is necessary for US electronics. The bed and pillows are very comfortable. House keeping has flowed in and out without any disruption.   Entertainment wise they played all my favorite Brazilian tunes during the day and there was an epic flamenco troop that performed one night.   The restaurant and beach servers are abundant and tend to your every need without being intrusive. "
"Couple trip - great beach club to chill and excellent service with Abraham!! The food was very good (we ordered tuna bowl and the coconut ceviche with passion frui) and the drinks were great too, asking for chef specialties."
"This place is excellent! The service, the food, the environment!! Nothing to complain about. The beach is beautiful - although we could not use it due to the seawood and the crashing waves, it was still amazing. Private yoga sessions - wonderful! The food, the drinks, the smells, cleanliness! This place is a must!"
"I came here on a yoga retreat from my university - I can't speak to the quality of the yoga here as our instructor came with us from CA, but the staff was all wonderful and we had a lovely experience. There was an issue with seaweed but not much can be done about that - it seems to be something that happens all along the coast at this time of year."

"Superb service from the front desk to beach staff, always there to help, great cocktails! Good location, a quiet enclave in Tulum with restaurants and bars nearby allowing us a wander out for lunch and dinner at our leisure. "
"Leading a 15 students class for a week. Love everything, the food is delicious, right on the beach, there is a small pool and spa, 3 yoga shalas to teach yoga, flexibility with class schedule, fun extra activities/ excursions."
"We decided to go to Be Tulum restaurant, after having a walk on Tulum’s beach. The place is absolutely beautiful, peaceful and relaxing. We loved being advised by Giancarlo about the food and the ceviches, which were maybe the best food we had in our entire trip in Mexico. He was the perfect waiter, and could answer every single question we had. After this amazing lunch, we thought we had to come back to Be Tulum and I went back for a smoothie the day after. Same atmosphere of peace, and great tastes. Gianc"

Carla, david, raul, luis, fernando showed us impeccable service! Thank you! Carla the front desk girl helped us book a private chef to come cook us breakfast. And what a treat that was.

The staff was incredibly kind, genuine, and thoughtful every step of the way. We so appreciated seeing familiar faces each day!

"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND DISRESPECTFUL. We booked a so called ""Wim Hof Ice bath on the beach"" and when we showed up the organiser was ""out in town"" and tried to blame some other member of staff for not booking the event - when he was the only one managing it... we drove 2h that day to join the event that never happened. We were treated very badly and rude,... the place is overpriced with terrible customer service, I'm still waiting for a refund one month later...stay away..."
" asked to be served by Giancarlo, and all went perfect one again. We felt sad to leave the place, but will surely come back to this little paradise."
"We were very excited when we booked Alaya months in advance. We arrived at the hotel with a group of friends. First of all, in this hotel you have to negotiate about everything in order to get a service or amenities. You negotiate on a beach towel, you negotiate on a coffee which is given in the morning free of charge, you negotiate on AC during as it's limited while you pay almost a luxury hotel rate in Eu or US. If you do not insist on the thing you want, you do not get it. (for instance: when my friend a"
"My wife and I stayed at Encantada Tulum for 2 nights and we absolutely loved it! The room was beautiful and offered a unique jungle experience while also having access to a private beach. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome and comfortable the moment we arrived. We highly recommend staying here!"
This was the best thing I could ever have chosen to do for myself. Amansala and all the staff that work there are incredible; I am truly grateful to each and every staff member and instructor that works there. I chose the Bikini Bootcamp and although it pushed me beyond my limits; I honestly had so much fun. The schedule is incredible and a lot of care goes into making each day epic by the staff. I was never bored! Thank you so much!

He is well prepared, organized, generous with his knowledge; his instructional manner is approachable, patient and easy to follow.  His attention to detail is also commendable.  The dishes we prepared were visually attractive and creatively plated.  Who would have thought we had prepared such fine dining under h"
"Rescued from the wreaking ball, this series of old warehouses has been repurposed as an Inn. Funky shaped rooms are remarkably quiet considering that it is in the heart of St. John's. The knowledgeable front desk can point you to all the attractions, the goodies in the lounge will keep you happy while you wait for that early morning flight and the OVOO restaurant is a little gem offering among other items, oven fired pizzas. This is a good alternative to the franchised large hotels."
" Keeping and they came to take that as it was a very normal animal. When I asked for a room change as I didn't feel fine if that was the only scorpion in the room, I was refused. I seriously couldn't sleep and did not feel fine in that room. There was definitely a hole somewhere as we never left the door open. The reaction of the reception as well as the other employees was weird. They were not even sorry, they did not offer us anything else nor extended apologies. At the beach one server came 5 times to me"
"We visited Encantada as our final hotel on a 3 week trip around Mexico, hoping to have saved the best till last after reading some incredible reviews but we were a little bit underwhelmed.   The hotel itself is stunning, nestled away at the quieter end of Tulum beach and is a perfect escape from the loud beach clubs.   Our room looked great, and had all the amenities that we needed. The bed is so comfy! We did have an issue with noise though - we were on the ground floor and the room above were so loud that"
"Spent 12 nights here on bikini bootcamp mid-March.  Perfect time to go, the weather was always warm, moving to lovely and hot most days. The twice-daily yoga especially was fantastic, lots of different teachers with different emphasis on their practice, all super good, and very qualified. It means that things never get dull and by the time I got back my body felt amazing. There's lots of other classes and activities on the menu, HIT, salsa etc. also regular trips out with the funster known as Carlo - he's f"
"Adrian from Maresias restaurant and also the room service department, was phenomenal. We went to Maresias our first night and since then he was 10/10. Florencio from the front desk helped us throughout our stay with any questions we had was helpful and hands on with great food recommendations. We haven’t even left back home yet but we wanted to write this review and express our gratitude because that’s how amazing it was."
"Tiene todos los servicios que puedas necesitar sky, conexión WIFI, ventiladores de techo funcionales, AC. Todos los controles bien puestos y funcionando a la perfección. Las habitaciones son básicas en espacio, pero tienen su pequeño escritorio, closet y hasta cajones. Solo tiene 3 habitaciones, y el baño es común.  Hay dos baños completos que se comparten entre las 3 habitaciones por lo que mi recomendación es que si vas con familia o amigos reserven este lugar y será como tener tu propia casa en Todos San"

" present during the day. For example, when we were relaxing on the gorgeous private section of the beach you had to go up to the main restaurant if you wanted something as they didn't often come down to offer drinks etc.  The hotel is spotless and the staff work very hard to keep it clean, but each morning when we came back from breakfast from the onsite restaurant at around 9am our room was being cleaned. We found this a bit awkward as we then had to wait for them outside our room to finish before being ab"
" Melissa (the owner) is friendly, helpful and clearly works hard to maintain high standards throughout.  My room was beachfront and definitely worth the extra cost. Falling asleep to the sounds of the ocean was all part of the restful vacation I was seeking.   Met some lovely people, there's a communal table for bikini boot campers, (most of us travelled solo), so you can be as outgoing and social or reclusive as you want."
First time visiting Be Tulum. I saw it on instagram and decided to visit. We had the Agua Suite and it was beautiful and comfortable. We only ate at Maresias but there is a second restaurant as well. Everyone at Maresias we welcoming and we had great service. Carlos Ramirez and Javier Cruz were especially great. I felt like a princess. 
"Casa Flores is very warm & welcoming, with lovely views of the ocean and better yet, the waves lulled us to sleep.  We enjoyed our porch and the hammock by the pool.  Most of all, we appreciated Barb's generous hospitality and assistance to store many pounds of fresh frozen fish for the night.  It was an ""above and beyond"" request and she graciously helped us out.   The only downside to Casa Flores is that it's a bit too far to walk into town; however, the ocean views are worth it!"
"The hotel looks very nice on pictures, nevertheless our stay there was average. We had a room on the top floor, which means you are underneath the roof. The roof is made out of straw, which means there are small holes in it, which led to insects falling on our bed, very unpleasant. One morning we discovered a scorpion in our room, housekeeping removed it, they said on the one hand they had never had it before, but on the other hand they were like ""this was just the jungle, you have to live with that"".

The hotel design was so beautiful and unique. Coolest hotel room we’ve ever stayed in. Ours had a private pool. The food was very good by the beach and our waiter Ruben was very nice and friendly. Would definitely come again. 
"This place is wonderful! Delightful, comfortable, spacious, and stylishly appointed casitas with all the amenities you could hope for. Barbara is a kinda and hospitable host, and is happy to provide any assistance or extra little things we have asked for during our stay.

" checked in. The hotel is overpriced for what is on offer. Despite paying so much, breakfast is not included and the air conditioning only works at night, not 24 hours. The beach has beautiful, white sand, but there is a problem throughout Tulum that a lot of dead algae are washed ashore, which means you can't swim in the sea."
"Encantada is an absolute treasure. It was immediately obvious to us how much care and thought their staff puts in ensuring every element of your experience is perfect. The rooms are spotless, elegant, and comfortable. The property is impeccably maintained, beautifully designed, and had thoughtful moments throughout. The staff were absolutely incredible - I can't say enough about them and how at home they made us feel.   I don't think you could go wrong with any of the rooms. There is a private beach with am"
We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel! The food and rooms are great! The service at the hotel is really good. Everyone is very nice and happy to help. Especially thanks to Giancarlo who made our experience at the beach exceptional!
"We got a great last minute deal when we changed our plans and we were delighted with this small, basic and very clean hotel.  The location is central (which comes with a bit of street noise and music), but it is close to everything and you can walk everywhere.  This is a very basic hotel but the rooms are big and clean, the bed is very firm, and the bathroom small and basic.  You will only get two towels, two packets of shampoo, and two bottles of water, but you will also get a table and chairs in your room"
" with. The property is pet friendly as well.  A ten minute walk up the road brings you to a path down to a gorgeous beach and lagoon - since there is no parking nearby, it’s usually empty, and it’s great for shell hunting.  Overall, we highly recommend Casa Flores for a vacation or a longer term stay.  I can’t speak highly enough of our experience here - look no further for a perfect Todos Santos getaway!"

" one near the reception desk.  We also utilized their concierge for arranging travel to and from the airport, a tour of Chichen Itza, massages, and a truly amazing Mezcal tasting - all of which were perfect.

"the layout was not very good with a very small access to the bathroom, sink next to the door, rather noisy from neighbors but not outside, bed was decent, room was clean, room rather small, good for one night in a small town that was rather pleasant"

We were unable to stay and spoke to Barbara before leaving. She kindly agreed to a compromise refund which we greatly appreciated.

"This quaint little hotel was an historic sugar cane mill that has been converted into a 4 room Inn. It is an absolutely charming little place. Surrounded by lush vegetation, the rooms open onto a brick courtyard that steps up to a lovely pool area. The spacious rooms are finished in Mexican decor and are complete with a mini kitchen, including a fridge. There is no office or main reception area. You will be greeted at the gate with a welcome sign with your name, room number and date on it. Your key will be "
We like this place. It was clean and the bed was firm. The only problem is the noise from cars without mufflers and dogs that fight during the night. It is a great low budget option because Todos Santos is way over priced.

The hotel is located in town at the end of the main street, perfect for walking into town. There are many restaurants close by within reasonable walking distance. There is a designated parking area for your vehicle behind the hotel. This little gem is so charming, very quiet and very unique. It has "
"Maria Bonita is not luxurious but is well located in down town Todos Santos and has all the essentials -a/c, t.v., shower with reliable water.     It is near most restaurants and shops in the charming town of Todos Santos.   Good value for money and helpful staff. Recommended,"
"My friend and I stayed there for one night after we landed in San Jose Del Cabo and rented a car and drove up here. Very clean and a very nice girl in the office!! She didn't speak much English, so it was fun to try and brush up on my Spanish. Right in the center of town. The beds were a little hard but we managed. For the price of only $37.00 a night it was hard to beat!!"

"Very basic, very clean,economical, all you need for short visit to Todos Santos, the location is perfect to walk anywhere In town,lots of great restaurants. The hotel has lots of parking close by. I stayed here for a couple of nights whilst on a tour of B.C.S.   "
"Nice place and economical. Pretty hard to find much of anything in this price range within Todos Santos.  Large clean room, nice patio and pool, and laid back vibe.  Todos Santos itself is a bit rarified with affluence and tourist trappings and not our cup of tea.  Much preferred La Paz for its lack of tourist amenities. "
"We stayed at the hotel part of the Posada. Rooms are beautiful and spacious, although pricey compared to many other places in the region, although Todos Santos in general is very expensive. Service was really loose, our room was not ready by 5:30 pm, it was difficult to find the owner and there was no one in sight for most part of the night (no guard, no one). No wifi. No receipt for our payment except for an informal piece of paper worth nothing anywhere. I wonder if they pay taxes... We were a bit disappo"
"So glad I stayed here, one of the best places I went to, and I was nervous after reading some reviews. I reserved online, all went smoothly, except the owner was a little hard to find at first. Just hang out at the pool for awhile--it helps to be laid back here. room was large, with a kitchenette, and the pool area is gorgeous. another review said it was far from downtown and restaurants, but i disagree.. can check it ona map, but a restaurant next door, a block down at end of street there are 4-5 others, a"
"We drove from Cabo San Lucas to Todos Santos to spend 2 nights here. When we’re on the way there we just got an email said they cancelled our booking! We don’t have a place to stay, it all fully booked. They just leave us in the cold. Not recommended if you have solid plan"

"I love Todos Santos, every corner I love. Casa Rancho was a wonderful experience. Fantastic place, service and environment. I will be back every time I am in Todos Santos. Thanks to all the Staff for such an incredible time!"
"We booked two rooms at Posada del Molino about 5 days in advance on Booking.com. When were arrived we were told by the owner Alice that she had given one of our rooms away to a passerbyer. Apparently they were staying for three nights which was more than our one. To compensate for this she stuck three beds side by side into one room for myself, my husband, our toddler, 8 month old (who does not sleep through the night), father and mother in law to squish into, like sardines. There was a reason we had two ro"
"We enjoyed an extended stay with family at Casa Rancho for 2 weeks over Christmas and new year. We rented just over half of the complex including; a contained suite, separate master suite, an outside bunkhouse containing two bedrooms with shared bath and a large main gathering house equipped with large living/dining and kitchen space. Casa Rancho is located a short drive from Todos Santos, it is safe and some amenities are within walking distance.  The grounds and gardens are a beautiful oasis within the de"
" long drive back to our place as at this point it was too late to find another suitable accommodation in town. What a disappointment it was for us. This looked like a beautiful place to stay (other than the two large dogs that were drinking from the pool and standing on the outdoor tables), but never have I experienced such terrible service."
"We were in a single room that was clean and nicely designed but poorly equipped - no tv, no comfortable chair, no coffeemaker, no microwave, no ice maker. Mini fridge was loud enough to awaken us in the middle of the night! Location was relatively quiet but definitely not walkable to central district. There was a cafe and yoga studio nearby. Employees were very nice and helpful."
" tested our limited Spanish with the house keepers. We never did have luck refreshing our kitchen drying towels. After about 5 days we located the storage shed for supplies such as toilet tissue, garbage bags and fresh kitchen sponges. The mosquitos seemed to favour my youngest and Alec did provide a bug net at our request (which helped immensely). Alec encouraged us to cut an agave bloom spike for our Christmas tree, which my kids enjoyed decorating. Unfortunately Alec never followed though with a deep sea"
"Perhaps the suites are nicer, but room 5 is very basic and not what I would term ""mid-range"" (after traveling around central Mexico for 6 weeks).  Maintenance lacking - burned out light bulbs, broken lamp, the hot water in the shower is only 3 minutes, no housekeeping done unless specifically requested, garbage is not picked up, the bed is small (probably close to double size, definitely not queen), no chairs in the room, window shades are pretty but they do not keep out nighttime light, no heat in the room"
" plus/minus, but the road walking up to the hotel from the town has poorly maintained sidewalks and the roadway is dusty.  Finally, the price is quoted in US dollars, but then payment has to be made in pesos, with a very unfavorable conversion rate.  Other reviewers mention a nice manager, but we never saw anyone other than lower-level staff people.  All in all, if this were a budget hotel, I could recommend the hotel, but not at the price point (paid ninety-five USD)."

"My wife and I spent an evening at Casa Rancho in mid-January 2017. The accommodations are 3,000 feet down a dirt road a couple miles from the city center of Todos Santos. You'll definitely need a rental car to get there. We had a Nissan March and had no trouble negotiating the road. The grounds are expansive with brick / gravel paths connecting buildings and common areas (Pool, kitchen area, and upper viewing deck). Palms and various foliage provides adequite shade. All was neat and tidy. We had a private r"
The rooms of Casa Bentley are spacious and clean and the pool is very nice !  It is a hidden gem located in the center of Todos Santos.  Alvaro is very welcoming and caring. Do not hesitate to book at Casa Bentley you will not regret it!

This is a little bit off the beaten track but is close to great restaurants in a few markets. It's definitely walkable to City center. The pool was nice. The check-in was quick and the woman who did it was very friendly
" door and down a few steps is a common area building with a full kitchen and seating area. Very nice. Even had a hand press juicer so we got some oranges from a local market and had fresh OJ in the morning. Coffee maker, cups, plates, etc. are all available. Next to the kitchen building is a small pool which appeared clean (I didn't go in). The upper viewing deck has a few comfy chairs to look at the Pacific in the distance and a hammock, though the hammock was ripped so I didn't trust it to hold me.  The o"
This place is fantastic.  Every room is unique as is the whole grounds.  We will recommend it to all our friends for Todos Santos stays and we will be back.  The whole grounds are like an oasis in the city.  The rooms are large and all decorated tastefully.  There's nothing else like it.  The manager was friendly and recommended a place for us to eat as well as local sites.  You won't be sorry if you stay here.
"We took an impromptu trip to Todos Santos from Cabo Este and literally booked this hotel online while we were driving over. Seemingly brand new facility with lovely landscaping and very clean and comforatbly appointed rooms. Tucked away in a quiet little neighborhood just a couple of minutes from the downtown core of Todos Santos. In the area immediately surrounding the Villas you will find an excellent local restaurant, an ice cream shop a general store and a beer store as well as the areas largest beachfr"

"This location is quite beautiful and really gives you a taste for the local flavor of Todos Santos. The grounds are well kept, clean and comfortable. There is a lovely spot for morning yoga looking out onto the arroyo and ocean horizon. The ability to rent mountain bikes is also epic if you are without car and a fun way to get through town. There are fully stocked shared kitchens (but I believe you can get casitas with kitchen as well) and there is a nearby local store where you can get everything you need."
Serendipity is a true gem! The grounds are gorgeous and so well kept. Sharon has such an eye for aesthetics and plants. The breakfast was delicious and filling and a huge menu to choose from.   It’s also so accessible to a stunning beach . Just a very quick walk down the beach.   Sharon and her pups are so lovely! I highly recommend this place and will be back!
Casa Bentley is a hidden gem in a great location and has a very interesting and generous host - Bob Bentley.  We had a group of 4 couples and the accommodations were far and above adequate and comfortable.  Lovely B&B.  Would have loved to stay longer.
We have stayed several places in Todo Santos and none equal this! The grounds are spectacular and they have such detail with the amenities! We had a group of 8 and each room was more beautiful than the other. The team was so accommodating and treated us so special. Breakfast was fabulous with more than we could eat! Don’t miss this treasure!
"If you are looking for a quite spot filled with natural beauty to stay then this is the place. Alec, the host, was very helpful with local information and recommendations.  He is an avid surfer and knows the place well. The compound is very close to nature in a wonderful way.  You will wake to the calling of local birds and be sung to sleep by the geckos.  Enjoy! "
"We stayed at Serendipity for 12 days in February 2022 and fell in love. Fell in love with Southern Baja. Fell in love with Serendipity. And with the town of Todos Santos.   The people:  Sharon (the owner) is an absolute sweetheart! She’s just the best. She’s owned Serendipity for many years (built it with her husband) and is an expert on all things, Todos Santos  The staff: Kind, friendly, super hard-working, and attentive. Rooms are kept clean. Requests are always met quickly.   The dogs! The best! Sharon "
"We booked Casa Bentley for a two night stay for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.. and what a treat. We chose the Fountain Room which I highly recommend. The pictures don’t do it justice, its a massive suite with a large four person dining table, small fridge/freezer, sitting area, king bed, huge walk in shower and a jacuzzi tub. The room also has a private outdoor terrace surrounded by beautiful trees and gardens. You also have access to a small kitchenette with stove, fridge, coffee maker and some basic ki"
" builder of the property, Robert,  he is a lovely older gentleman who is very proud of what he has built and rightly so... he is a retired geology professor and has incorporated his jasper stone collection all throughout the property imbedded in the walls. Simply stunning and such unique architecture throughout!  The pool is gorgeous and lots of comfortable common  seating areas to enjoy.  We felt very welcomed at Casa Bentley and can’t wait to visit again when we are in Todos Santos."
"If it was possible to give 10 stars, I would. Let's start with the basics -  a) Location - par extraordinare. A 5-minute walk along a sandy path to one of the best beaches in the world.  Watch the humpbacks and Mobulas breach right from the beach. Watch the deep sky from the roof at night.   Fall asleep to the sound of the crashing breakers, wake up to the song of the desert Thrashers and doves Walk to town for breakfast... b) Style - The rooms are laid out as classic Casitas - with a shared kitchen - what "
 and everything was delicious. Great way to start the day   The B&B:  We loved it. Know going in - this isn’t the 4 Seasons. It’s a Bed and Breakfast. And it’s perfect.   The pictures and descriptions found within these reviews are totally accurate. The rooms are kept clean. Many (but not all) have an ocean view.   We were able to see whales splashing around most days right from the pool/breakfast area  There’s a great pool + Jacuzzi.   The Town: This was our first time in Todos Santos and wow. what a beaut

" chairs and towels d) Connectivity - the best we have experienced in MEX this year  But what swept us off our feet was the owner - Alberto.  We were late getting out of La Paz and had lost connectivity. He tried to ping us multiple times, and GOOG maps drove us to a wrong place and we were completely lost in the dark.  He searched half the town in the dark to fetch us! Unbelievable! He is a great host - and even let us check out *hours* late. He gave us great tips to get to the local attractions, including "

"During a quick COVID get-away, we spent 3 of our nights in Todos Santos, Baja Sur.   Casa Bentley was the perfect venue for us.   The hotel feels like it is out-of-the-way due to its walls, architecture and landscaping.  However it is on the northern edge of the Village of Todos Santos.   We were able to easily walk around the main part of town from the hotel.  There was onsite parking, so we were able to park behind locked gates, and drive to and from Todos Santos as we desired.   It was perfect!  The arch"
"Def a drive down a dirt road from town. Lovely room, with shower room & coffee machine inside. Tables & chairs outside & the ‘kitchen’is not a shared outdoor space as we expected - for our king size room it was up 3 steps inside a door at the side of the cabana. Just a big enough cupboard to hold a fridge with water flagon & single electric (worm) ring on top, right next to a stone sink with cold water tap. More like glamping!  Great location: just 5 mins walk down sand track to beach where we watched humpb"
This is a beautiful well-appointed Cabana has all the amenities and is only a short walk to the beach. We love hearing the ocean Roar and the sound of Wildlife. And especially the donkeys During the night. . The Night Time Entertainment in town was incredible. Where we were able to hear. Irish music and contemporary two competing restaurants across the street from each other. Town is it's a short drive from or our Cabana.
"We stayed at Serendipity...loved our time there! Sharon is a wonderful host, and the staff is very friendly. The flowers and trees are very beautiful. Breakfast was delicious..made to order and fresh squeezed juice!  The pool is great too!We will be back. Highly recommended!"
"I can not say enough wonderful things about Serendipity! It’s such a beautiful little place, right next to the ocean, with wonderful views, lovely gardens, a salt water pool and hot tub!  My husband and I rented a Casita for the week and loved having our own space! You could totally bring kids but there’s not a lot to do for kids there.  The breakfast is made to order by the sweetest women who are fantastic cooks!  Sharon, the host, is amazing! She’s so knowledgeable about the area and is happy to give her "
" quartz, jasper, etc.  (The owner's father was a collector.)  Many of the interior and exterior design touches were lovely.    This is not a hotel for people wanting clean modern lines, large closets with tons of storage, and other modern conveniences.  That being we had a comfortable king-sized bed, hot water and good pressure, an outside patio and plenty of room for us to spread out inside the room and bathroom.   There was a place for our unpacked clothing, and to store the suitcase.  The wifi was adequa"
"Three of us stayed in two casitas at Sol Caliente last March, and we couldn't have been happier. The design and privacy of the casitas with a 3 minute walk to the beach couldn't be beat. Alberto was friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable about the area, and his advice was spot on. While it might seem a bit out of the way, it is an easy drive to town but away from all the noise ... and the beach is a very short walk out the front door. Spending two weeks in south Baja, this was by far the most relaxing and"
"We keep coming back to this peaceful, colorful and warm getaway in Todos Santos,  not in touristy Cabo. This small and beautiful B&B, is situated in an area of modern homes, spacious gardens, and an easy walk to the beach. We can watch the whales from the patio and many of the rooms, or walk to the beach to watch the turtles hatch in season. Sharon, our hostess, prepares an amazing Mexican breakfast every morning  with lots of local seasonal fruit. She loves to keep us informed with any events in town while"

"This is a 4 casitas hotel, love the design and the location, a five minutes walk from the most stunning beach. Ever so quite, paradise. None the less, beds are cheep and incredibly uncomfortable, the beddings are not hotel grade and not in line with the rates they charge. We had no room service for the duration of our stay, 3 nights and the room was not exactly clean when we arrived. Seams like a bachelor own the place and this is how it feels. I would have enjoyed the grounds a lot more if they did not hav"
"most of the reviews for this lovely place talk about the amazing food.  Now, make no mistake, the food is amazing, both in presentation and taste.  And the place is beautiful and clean and we enjoyed the views and the peacefulness very much.  But we most enjoyed our hostess (and host), their friendliness, their pride in what they were doing."
"This is a wonderful, authentic B&B in a great neighborhood of Todos Santos. Sharon and her team make everyone feel welcome in their clean, beautiful space with all the thoughtful touches. Perfect for a quiet escape. Don’t miss sunset, the evening turtle release or the yummy breakfast!!"
"In the beginning I thought I'd made the wrong choice for the 3 of us. I'd gotten the impression that we could walk to town and manage without renting a car. Driving in Mexico has never been my favorite thing to do. But Alberto, in his very kind way, suggested that a car would be most useful. And Alberto was always kind and helpful. While he was ever-present in his own dwelling on the property, you never saw him, but when you called his name, he was there and ready with suggestions.   Anyway, after trying to"
"When you leave, you will dream of Isabella's food until you return. A small B+B (2 rooms in a separate building) owned by Isabella and Gabriel. To say the are a wonderful, charming couple is far from adequate. Accommodations are always clean and comfortable. The grounds are beautiful. Close to the beaches-- 20 minute walk with some hills. Close to Todos Santos--10 minute drive and you need a car here. The roads of La Poza, the neighborhood of Todos towards the ocean are dirt, rutted, and not well marked so "
Los Colibris is an amazing getaway just a short drive from downtown Todos Santos. The grounds are stunning and both the hosts and chefs are fabulous. I came for a retreat and was almost overwhelmed by the hospitality and beauty of the grounds.
"When you meet Sharon (the proprietress)  you are instantly welcomed. She is very friendly and knows a ton about the region. She helps with reservations at restaurants. The room was very nice and unique. You could tell that the whole place was built in an artistic way. The place is about a 10 minute walk to the beach with only one building in between. No swimming in the ocean though, serious rip currents.  The rooms had hot water, air conditioning and a 5 gallon bottle of water for drinking along with wifi. "
" Todos Santos, but I want to devote more of my review to Sole Caliente. It was beautiful, clean, quiet, and had all the needed amenities. But, for me, the amazing piece, was the beach.  It was about 5 mins. walk and so totally uncrowded and non-commercial, that we would spend 2-3 hours each day just walking. It was heaven.  The ocean isn't for swimming in this area, and in March at least, it is a bit chilly, but oh the colors of that beautiful, mesmerizing surf!  And throughout the night you could hear it p"

"Isabel and Gabriel are wonderful hosts, and we could have just chatted with them about dogs and art and life all day. Isabel is an amazing cook, and breakfast was a highlight of our day. The property is gorgeous, peaceful, and has great views. We took wonderful walks to the beach, could see the ocean and whales from the house, chilled in our hammock, and played with the dog. We didn't happen to use the pool, but it looked great and had lots of space to relax.  If/when we come back to Todos Santos we will de"
"Our group stayed at Los Colibris before and after going out to Camp Cecil. The rooms were wonderful! It was clean, spacious, comfortable with a glorious view of the gardens and ocean!  The gardens are gorgeous and full of birds. The breakfasts were professional prepared and amazing. Highly recommend this boutique hotel!"
"My husband and I spent four days in the Treehouse room at Serendipity and we weren't ready to leave.  The room was comfortable and the view from both the room and the balconies was spectacular.  Breakfast was made to order and included.  I particularly enjoyed the passion fruit juice.  Sharon, the owner, answered all questions and was very informative.  She made several very good restaurant suggestions and shared her personal experience and favorites at each.  She also connected me with several other local "
"We were fortunate to stay with Isabel and Gabriel, and enjoyed every moment! We booked their Tomatillo Room for 5 nights, which boasts spectacular views of palm-tree covered countryside and the ocean in the near distance. From their balcony on the first morning we saw a whale spout, and we were not disappointed by the wildlife or scenery. Isabel's breakfasts rival some of the best restaurants around the world: she's so creative and inventive with combinations and flavors, and the presentation was always per"
"As part of our TOSEA Camp Cecil adventure, we found ourselves in the lovely Los Colibris Casitas.  Set into the hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, this wonderful getaway was the perfect bookend to our time on Isla Espiritu Santo.  Away from the crowds of Cabo, Los Colibris offers spectacular amenities, including fully furnished casitas (wi-fi is available) and a marvelous dining experience at Iker's cafe.  Business or pleasure, you should take the chance to enjoy the hospitality at Los Colibris Casitas"
"Our only regret is that we only spent one night. Travel up an off-the-path road and arrive at paradise.  The views are stunning as the resort is tucked into the mountainside. Seeing and listening to the ocean from our perch was special. We stayed in Bobisuri House and our room was fantastic with a large sitting area, spacious bedroom, super-large vanity and an open large shower with access to the outdoors. The room had a fridge, microwave and all the amenities. We loved the decor. The property is beautifull"
" a boat tour to swim with the Whale Sharks in La Paz. One of the best trips I've ever taken, and that is owed in large part to the hospitality we received at Casablanca. Thank you Isabel and Gabriel! "

"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in La Molflita casita. The views are spectacular and having the ability to watch the whales breach as they swim by and the sunsets, wow, the sunsets are worth the Mexican roads to get in there. We thought the GPS was wrong but after some bumps and ruts on the roads we pulled up to heaven.  If given the option to book a hotel right in town with restaurants and shops right there or back to Los Colibris with its bumps and ruts, we would go back to Los Colibris in a heartbea"
"We loved our stay ay Casablanca, where Isabella and Gabriel under supervision from  Camillo (dog) takes  care of their guests in a wonderful way. Even if it is a little rough to get to Casablanca, once you are there, it is such a treat. You get the most amazing new breakfast every morning, and if you are ""lucky"" also wonderful dinner from Isabellas kitchen. They also have lots of really good suggestions about, what to do in the area. The  2 rooms are great and there is a little pool to cool off in in the ga"
Los Colibris is a magical hideaway tucked into a rugged landscape. It is the perfect setting for either a quiet getaway or as a base for adventure and exploration of the Baja peninsula. We truly enjoyed every minute and cannot wait to return.
"Wow, what a spot. Amazing view of the pacific and an easy drive to town. A real treat to fall asleep and wake up to the sound of waves crashing in the distance. Well appointed and equipped room with the right amenities included coffee maker and ground coffee for morning cup on the balcony. Dirt road in is a little bumpy and rocky, we held our breath at times concerned it might cause a flat on the rental car, but all good. Amanda and team always very responsive and helpful. WiFi worked reliably when needed. "

"My husband and I stayed here for a week for our first trip (almost) post-Covid and it was exactly what we wanted--gorgeous, peaceful, and far from the madding crowds. We stayed in one of the Babisuri suites, with spectacular views overlooking the sea. Each of the casitas is totally private and beautifully decorated, and we hardly saw another soul. The grounds of Los Colibris are charming, with gorgeous gardens and friendly dogs and cats. Bryan, the owner, is a very gracious hostess and was willing to help a"
We loved our stay at Villas La Mar. The view was stunning and it was very quiet and clean. Kitchen had everything we needed. Equipped with everything we needed for a relaxing stay.  Only downside was proximity to food.
Isabel and Gabriel master the delicate skill of being perfect hosts. They are so kind in giving advice but are never too obtrusive.   Breakfast is delicious: a Euro Mexican mix.  Just Waw!  We had the upstairs room which is beautifully decorated.   We would come back in a heartbeat!  
" He's awesome!). Breakfast is available onsite (thank you, Eliazar, for the wonderful desayunos), but otherwise you'll need to eat in town. There are lots of excellent places to eat in Todos Santos, and guests are given a long list of recommended restaurants, all of which are safe and delicious. It's not entirely necessary to rent a car--Bryan arranged an airport transfer for us, and we enjoyed walking into town--but know that Los Colibris is about a mile from the center of Todos Santos, and the swimming be"
"Villas La Mar was absolutely gorgeous - I even extended my stay because it was so pleasant! The dirt road to the location is totally manageable, and the proximity to the ocean / gorgeous views are top notch. Stayed in room 15 and room 18, both were amazing.  Would definitely stay here again!"
…
"We loved our stay at Villas La Mar. The room was well equipped - the bed was comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, our balcony w/ fire pit was perfect, and there isn’t much better than taking a hot shower with a view of the ocean. We loved leaving the sliding doors open and just shutting the screen door so we could fall asleep and wake up to the sound of waves crashing on the shore. Amanda and the staff were very helpful when needed but left us to enjoy our time alone otherwise. It’s quite a hi"
"Stunning views of a pond and the majestic Pacific Ocean - modern stylish clean and comfortable. Coffee and coffeemaker provided, pool… in a small condo complex. Ten minutes down to the beach on a rocky trail. Short 10 minute drive to town yes, on dirt roads, that’s the only way to have an ocean view in Todos Santos!"
"I do not know where to begin. The Los Colibris resort is one of the best kept secrets out there. My wife and I stayed for 1 full week and did not want to leave. We stayed in the La Chucha casita and wished that we could just move in. The sound of the ocean waves, smell of fresh flowers, and amazing bright sunsets to name a few. We cannot recommend this place enough. Owners Bryan and Sergio were great to visit with and were very friendly. Town is only 1.9 miles away and the food was superb. Go see these nice"
"From the moment we arrived, the staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. Once we walked to our room we were taken away with the breathtaking views and the beautiful and eclectically styled rooms. We spent evenings on the balcony listening to the waves, star gazing, and watching the moon set.. which is a sight to see! When we weren’t at Cerritos Beach, participating in an adventurous activity, or off touring the city, we spent the afternoons whale watching poolside and catching the warm sun rays. This"
"We spent 3 great nights in early February at this comfortable modern Airbnb. Cliff side location with awesome views of the Estero/Lagoon and ocean, tons of birds and whales.  The room was nicely furnished with a small frig/freezer, toaster, coffee maker, silverware, cups, glasses.  Nice shower."
"We had the good fortune to spend three nights in #18. The room had all the amenities necessary for an outstanding stay. The views were spectacular and the endless whale sightings only added to the overall experience, not to mention the sunsets are amazing. We are already planning our next trip back."
"Absolutely beautiful property. If you’re willing and capable to walk a lot of stairs, I highly recommend the upper level rooms. Watching sunrises, whales, and sunsets from a birds eye view every day was a treat. Bed was comfy, pools were cool and refreshing. Staff was all extremely friendly and helpful."
"This is the best place in Todos Santos. Everything is fantastic and the whole experience is curated to optimize for total enjoyment. Renting a car is very recommended, checking in is very easy. The room is spacious, clean and very confortable. The views from the terrace are breathtaking, enjoying a cup of coffee while whale watching became our favorite thing in the world. The walk to the beach is a beautiful path where one can appreciate the endemic flora and the beach is stunning. Amanda is attentive and v"

Beautiful property. So well-kept and quiet and private. Loved all the decor and outside space. Beds were so comfortable with lovely linens. Enjoyed breakfast on our private patio area each morning.

 actual family house. This proved useful and one at least should really be provided anyway.  We chilled in the room in the heat of the day and used the reliable WiFi.   We did not take advantage of the inviting pool or patio at all as only there overnight.  The main room had two double beds on wooden bases with a small bedside table with two drawers between.

"I came down to Todos Santos, Mexico on vacation by myself to surf, practice my Spanish, and relax. The hostel in town was cheap and got great reviews but as I was here for nine days I wanted a place to stay that was more secure and would give me a place to retreat alone when I needed it.  The Hotel Miramar was perfect on all counts. A warm, friendly family that runs the hotel (they don’t speak much English which was fine with me!); clean, simple, pretty accommodations, including a small pool; and a place th"

"We chose VSC to stay for 4 nights for the days leading up to and after our elopement in Todos Santos - staying in both the Beach Bungalow (Palma) and the Sierra Suite in the North Villa. Both rooms were exceptional with stunning views of the ocean.  The grounds are so well kept and beautiful. The small details - like coffee and juice at the door in the morning and little treats before bedtime make this place extra special. Room service breakfast was wonderful, all of the cocktails were amazing and we saw so"
 wait to come back!

"Had a great stay here. Beautiful, quiet, large room in small out of the way compound. Comfortable bed. Great host.   Helpful restaurant suggestions Nice 20 minute walk to beach. Would definitely come again."
" to our 14 day trip in Baja California that we really needed. We loved listening to the sound of the waves crashing as we fell asleep. Not to mention, the coziest robes we have ever experienced in our lives! Thank you VSC, we will be back one day!"
"Dirty, very old, worn, didn't sleep well... would never stay there again! Not even for free!! Our tour guidebook recommended that it was worth being out of the town area but that was not the issue. Felt very unclean and uncomfortable."
"I've stayed at plenty of budget hotels and it was a bit dated but unfortunately, our room wasn't cleaned very well. The bathroom was a little gross with a wad of hair in the drain and the mattresses were really stained...we had to find another hotel last minute and the only other places in town are around $150 or more a night. Way more than we wanted to pay but didn't feel comfortable staying at the Miramar."
Our stay at Hotelito was better than expected. From our personal greeting from our host to wonderful breakfast every morning to evening mesqual it was so enjoyable.  The accommodations were excellent and location easy to find. I would definitely recommend a stay at Hotelito.

"This hotel confirms my theory that the lower the room rate, the more authentic the mexican warmth.  Marta and her family are truly lovely people.  And the property is great -- airy rooms, nice pool, easy walk into town or down tobeach.  Wifi is about 50%.  But u cant have everything!"
"It's all true from other reviews.  I'm still here,leaving this AM. Only 20 minutes from Cerritos Beach or Las Tunas,hit a good swell. Coffee,good wi-fi,warm shower. Car is a plus,somewhat away from the Centro,but a good walk(2-3K)."
"We stayed at the Hacienda  Chilicote for the second time in 3 years because  the location is excellent, easy walk to beach, all of the space you need for 6 people or intimate enough for 2. We love the full kitchen and Jenny's  always there to help with any questions , and recommend the best places to eat . She is always right on! We had people use the WIFI for work with no problems.  The animals make it a magical place and you will love the solitude. The staff is all top notch! Love , love , love."
"My wife and I just got back from 4 nights at Villa Santa Cruz, and we're already planning our next trip. We stayed in one of the newer tented ocean suites, and it was fantastic! The rooms are super nice, and we especially liked the soak tub and the private fire pit on the sand, steps away from our room. The owners have done an excellent job integrating the hotel and grounds into the natural landscape of the property. The staff are all super nice and incredibly helpful. Breakfast was delivered to our room da"
We enjoyed our stay here. The lovely units are detached which adds to the privacy. Each cottage is a different colour. A car is a must as it’s located just outside of Todos Santos. Hotelito is in a quiet area within driving distance to the restaurants. The staff was friendly. I would recommend this place!
" popular.   We can't wait to get back to Todos Santos, and specifically the Villa Santa Cruz!!"
…
"I've been back to The Hotelito six times in seven years. You could say that I am addicted to the peaceful beauty of this insanely gorgeous property. Each year I wonder which Casa I will stay in next year, each more exquisite than the next. I come to leave my hectic urban professional life behind and write.  It has been an enormously productive environment for me while I attend the Todos Santos Writers Workshop. I want to come and just read five books in the hammock outside on my patio and do absolutely noth"
"You need to stay at the Villa Santa Cruz in Baja’s Todos Santos. I have always been a big fan of Baja. But, I have found my new favorite spot in Todos Santos.   The Villa Santa Cruz is 13 km or 25 minutes North of Punta Lobos and only 15 minutes North of Hotel California Todos Santos and the main drag in town. Punta Lobos is where you will find local fishermen heading out in their Pangas; it is also home to the beautiful yet stuffy Hotel San Cristóbal.   When you get to the Villa Santa Cruz, there is almost"
" lull you to sleep each night. The Tented Ocean Suites each have their very own fire pit on the beach, perfect for watching the sunset.   You can also watch the sunset from the treehouse, which offers incredible vistas from Punta Lobos in the South to as far North as the eye can see.   At night you can dine either at the hotel itself or the beachfront restaurant called The Green Room, which offers some of the freshest fish I've ever had and some of the smoothest Mezcal from Oaxaca. I recommend the Rosarito "
…
"Weak internet connection, hot water shower, swimming pool.  You can hitchhike to the beach.  An inexpensive option if you want to surf Cerritos.  This is the only budget option in this nice town.  Laundry downstairs."
"WARNING: HOTEL STAFF STEALS YOUR MONEY! We stayed three nights in this place. The third day, after returning from the beach, I found my moneybelt in the room but WITHOUT my money, and it was 5000 pesos!! Every day there are cleaners, they took it out. When I confronted the owner with the situation, he said that ""it will never be safe to leave money in any hotel"", to me it is the proof they are thieves. But because it was cash money, I could not proof anything. I just reported the situation to the local poli"
"Gorgeous hotel and best in town - creates it's own perfect little world within its four walls. And much more stylish than the other smart place in town right across the road (whose beach club you can still use for a $30 fee).   Food delicious, hammocks loungers and plunge pool in the beautiful garden, friendly staff, bikes for heading to the beach (which is stunning by the way - do make the effort), great attention to detail. It's like out of conde naste or vogue or Mr and Mrs Smith. "
This was a pleasant surprise during a miserable guided tour. We had lunch here with low expectations and loved it. The staff was attentive and the food excellent. We had probably the best tortilla soup I’ve ever had. The fish dishes were cooked perfectly.I am going to try and recreate the Chili Rellenos stuffed with shrimp and scallops. The restaurant made an otherwise miserable day a success
"While we had lowered expectations at 400 pesos a night, we felt that this hotel could use a few improvements that are simple to do and it would be quite nice to stay in. For example fully screwing in light fixtures, adding a shower head to the rusted pipe in the shower, and a window pane or even a wood plank to cover the busted window overlooking the foot path above the shower. Other than that, the sheets were clean and the air conditioning worked marvelously, and the staff was helpful. "
"I paid 400 pesos a night--a little over $20. No credit cards. Spacious room and bathroom. Bed not overly comfortable but not an issue. A/C and great little fridge. Five minutes of hot water in the shower, followed by ten minutes of warm water. Solid water pressure. Two free bottles of water. Wifi is available but it only worked in my room next to the door. Laundry right downstairs. Central location close to everything in town...  If you don't want to spend big bucks on a boutique hotel, you can save a ton o"
"From the photos I was not sold, but once we got here. The location is right in town. Pretty quiet at night. The beds were so comfy /firm, including great pillows and soft towels. The pool is small and quiet. Very relaxing. It is super clean and well maintained. We stayed midweek. Free breakfast was included and delicious. There is air in the room, lots of light and black out shades. The mixologists at the bar were excellent. Generally we just had a great overall experience. Muchas gracias."
"As others have indicated, it’s largely a tourist trap. Hotel is still closed (presumably due to Covid restrictions) but the bar & restaurant are currently open.   Food was good in the restaurant, margs were okay & service par for the course. Don’t have high expectations- snap the pic you want & move on…"
"If you're looking for a cheap place in TS, this is it.  Pretty basic, but centrally located.  You can walk around town, but will need taxi or rental car to go to beach etc .   I don't expect this motel to be around too long with real estate prices going crazy. So get it while you can, before TS is completely ruined by tourism."
"The place is cheap, roughly 500 mxn for two twin beds, which was just enough for us. We did not want any luxury, but did not expect to find a rusted fridge with bugs! haha1 but hey! we did not even expect to have a fridge! The place is good if you are in a budget and you can get cheaper for only one bed. It is ideal if you are not fuzzy, and there is no reason to be, you will be out most of the day. The shower had actually no shower head, just the open end of the pipe, but good hot water. Real travellers wo"
"A 100+ year old fresco greets you at the small check in lobby behind the charming brick walls, you know you are somewhere special. The small hotel has the charm of a Mediterranean villa, the atmosphere of a tranquil oasis, the most comfortable rooms, incredible bar, amazing food and thoughtful and attentive staff.  The only thing that could improve the experience is that you find a unicorn under the bed and the winning lotto numbers on a napkin.   Otherwise you will just have to put up with the quaint perfe"
"We had a chance to have lunch at Hotel California during a recent trip to Todos Santos, Mexico. Considering the hype and name recognition, we expected more. We had a simple meal, nothing special, nothig worth writing home about.  Place is surrounded by touristy booths.  Not the spot to visit if you are looking for an authentic or tradtional Mexican experience."
"We planned to stay multiple nights, but left after the first. I would NOT recommend this place to a friend, but I can see how certain travelers wouldn't mind.  PROS: Cheap Central (well, Todos Santos is small so...) Clean sheets, floor.. Friendly office  CONS: Awful putrid smell (nothing to do with ground-floor Laundromat) Aggressive fluorescent lighting Broken toilet Green and moldy pool A near complete absence of furniture other than the bed, TV and stained and scary green armchair) Wifi only works near t"
"I loved this place. At 450 pesos for a twin with private bathroom, it was on the lower end of hotels in town, and it still came with little perks you normally don't get in a budget place. There were four bottles of water and a new bar of soap in our room when we arrived, and though we only stayed one night everything got replenished by 9.30 the next day. Same with four clean towels. In fact the whole place smells wonderful from the launderette on the ground floor, and the staff keep the white tile in the ro"
"Ever since my first visit to Todos Santos in 2021, I've wanted to stay at this lovely, historic Inn.  Finally, that wish came true this past week.  My wife and our two dogs were welcomed on short notice after our Airbnb flopped due to a faulty hot water heater.  Tosos Santos Inn to the rescue!  We arrived at 20:30 on a Wednesday night and Hector, who was at the front desk met us on the street just as we pulled up.  He was awesome and took care of helping us get our bags and the dogs settled in the room.  Ou"
Service was slow. Food was just okay. Very poor access for wheelchairs. Staff was pleasant but not very helpful. Overall disappointing since the last few times were wonderful. Not really sure if I want to go back even though I love the atmosphere there. Overall impression was…..disappointing
I have been here many times and the food and service have always been great. This time was a disaster. Even though they were not busy it took forever to get service. The food was barely edible.   Don't try this place if you are in a wheelchair. We zigged and zagged numerous times trying to get inside.   This is a definite MISS. Don't try it.   Never again.
 Smaller doubles with shared bathroom go for $350.

 Todos Santos Inn.  We'll see you again!
"This place is best known for its lawsuit with the Eagles Band.  It’s nice to photograph, but beyond that, it’s a large souvenir stand.  Thank God for our stop at Tequila Sunrise Restaurant or the day would have been a bust."
"A google search will tell you that this placed named like the famous song is purported not to be the place from the famous song.  I know that's what they say but there are enough similarities of what's described that I feel the place has credibility to be the actual place.  For instance when my family and I were there, I heard the mission bell from the church nearby.  It was a great little place to visit if you are staying in Cabo.  The courtyard where I wanted to dance to remember had a gate on it and was "

It was a wonderful experience. Customer service by all the staff was 10++++. Hans and George were on top of everything. The party on November 2 was spectaular. The rooms were clean and the ladies were friendly and accomadating. We look forward to returning. Thank you Todos Santos Inn!!
We stop every year in Todo Santos and have lunch at the Hotel California. We own a place in San Jose and usually take our friends up for a tour of the area.  This year while with friends we stopped into the gift shop to buy some tequila. The guy behind the bar had such a poor attitude that I almost left without buying the four bottles of their tequila brand.   Our friend asked if they could taste the tequila to decide if they should buy a few bottles themselves. He held up an empty bottle and said no there 
"Las Bougainvilleas is an extraordinary, 2 acre property within walking distance to the beach. There are two guest casitas which are beautifully appointed with intricate palapa roofs, full kitchens and private patios. A large pool and palapa bar for the use of the guests is within 10 feet of your casita. Pat Gerhardt, our host, was delightful and full of suggestions to make our stay in this wonderful well kept secret of a town one of our best vacations yet!"
"Bartender Erick and Chef Jorge took very good care of us. From craft cocktails to a delicious chef menu, we experienced the best in Todos Santos. Very kind, accommodating, and culinarily creative. Chef Jorge’s menu was phenomenal. I highly recommend coming here to visit."
"We stopped for one night in Todos Santos while driving from La Paz to Los Cabos. The town is small and nice with many shops (closing very early in the afternoon) we stayed at Todos Santos Inn and it has been a very good experience. The place is an old Mexican building with large rooms, high ceiling and a beautiful garden with a small pool. The personnel has been very professional and kind, the breakfast is “top” and the price very honest. The bar is “English style” offering a good variety of spirits and coc"

"on our weeklong visit to todos santos (FABULOUS city, by the way) we stayed at this inn for the last 2 nights, after 5 nights at alegria (see other review for alegria info). las bougainvilleas is in a lovely setting, huge property landscaped beautifully, with a nice-sized pool, and a short walk to the beach. only 2 accommodations, and both are free-standing units - one is a 2-story casita, the other is an octagonal-shaped 1-story casita. we stayed in the one-story casita, located a bit further back on the p"
We stayed here at the end of June 2021  for 3 nights - as you enter the hotel you are met with its rich history and lush foliage framing the internal garden  - tastefully restored with magnificent mature planting all around - cute little pool with comfortable loungers to relax - our room was spacious with a cute separate private planted garden - the atmosphere is calm although our room was close to the main Rd which had big trucks and could be very noisy  - the shower was pretty awful with very little water
"First of all - best margaritas in Cabo, maybe in anywhere Mexico or otherwise, had while dining at El Gusto one of the two nights stayed at Posada La Poza. I believe Juerg made them and they were so delicious and strong - definitely recommend dining at El Gusto and trying them. I spent the rest of the trip comparing and missing them!  Stayed 2 nights in one of the junior suites. Getting to the hotel is the only downside as you will need a car and the road is a bit rough, but that leads to the quiet seclusio"
" connection and service to all the guests. Everywhere had little artistic touches, the breakfast was delicious and different each day, and the menu for dinner was fresh and curated. I loved the privacy, the peacefulness every night. If you're looking for an experience outside of the huge loud resorts, definitely spend some time here."

"Of course, no one is traveling right now. So our flight here from San Jose, Ca had 40 passengers. But here we are in Todos Santos at Posada la Posa. Possibly the most beautiful place we’ve stayed in Mexico. We pretty much have the place to ourselves. Surprised the Baja is empty. They are serious about masking and distancing here.  And, they are doing rapid Covid tests all over town and at the airport. So it’s no big deal to get your Covid test before you hop on the plane home.  But if you’re coming to the B"

An intimate boutique with just a handful of rooms, Juerg & Libusche are wonderful hosts who go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. Out highlight was ordering of a delicious bottle of hand-selected Sauvignon Blanc from Valle de Guadalupe delivered to us with a snack poolside.

Set on a lagoon with a short walk to the beach and ocean. With the lush tropical landscaping all around, birdwatching is incomparable!  The friendly European owners, Libusche and Juerg, have created a beautiful and serene retreat. Libusche is a resident top artist in town. Her paintings and sculptures are on display throughout the rooms, restaura"

"So disappointed, and here's why: -Property is located in a dense, run down neighborhood, and difficult to find -It is a 15 min walk over boulders and brush to the ocean (snakes!). Serious footwear required.  -Jackhammering in neighborhood at 7a and continued throughout the day -Owner would not refund our cancelled nights, even though there were several rooms still available. (We had offered to pay for 1 night cancellation, even though the jack hammering made our stay unbearable) -Fireplace is dangerous and "

At the end of a dusty track, a short walk from the spectacular lagoon and long pristine beach of La Poza, is a trio of adjacent villas whose comforts are considerable and whose lovely high palapa thatch ceilings keep you cool. The adobe and palm thatch architecture is charming. You're serenaded by crickets and birds, and fall asleep to the sound of the sea.  --A drop of ink may make a million think.  Pawan Manghnani"
Incredible quiet but truly lovely home in a truly lovely setting with a few neighbors.  Surrounded by birds and nature.  A 200 yard scramble over a rocky trail and you have your own beach. Perfect hideaway to be able to experience the beauty and charm of Baja without the crowds and crazy atmosphere at Cabo itself.
"After staying 4 nights at Allegria in Todos Santoss, my husband, child and I were extremely pleased.  The property was gorgeous, the management was kind and generous and the rooms were spotless.  I look forward to my next visit.  Rhonda Conry"
"From the balcony you can enjoy the sweeping views of San Pedrito Beach.  We stayed in the Casita for the first few nights which was very nice and comfortable with a great patio looking out on the beach.  Then we moved to the upstairs one bedroom, which felt very luxurious, with fantastic views of the sea and the mountains.  We used the well equipped kitchen to make breakfast every morning and we went out to dinner every night at one of the many great, inexpensive restaurants in the area.  The house had all "

"The Northeast U.S. has endured another fairly brutal winter. To have been spared even as little of a week of it - in such beautiful surroundings - was certainly a treasure.  Property manager Giovanni was very responsive to our needs, but never intrusive. Our one stove issue was addressed within minutes after I sent an email.

"My family stayed at the Osprey while vacationing in Baja for a local wedding, and we could not have been happier. The Osprey provided us with a beautiful setting with ample room and amenities for our large family. Its location on the beach made for great sunset watching and ocean fun. To top it all off, the proprietor was so nice and helpful."
Ernie and Laurie are Great Hosts  I have lived in Todos Santos for 8 winters now. What is amazing about CalyCanto  is the quality of the homes and beauty of the overall offering. One of the nicest pool and patio area in Todos Santos. The whole propery says space and peace. Check in here first.
"We love Todos Santos and especially CalyCanto. Relaxing, quiet, rejuvenating are a few adjectives that come to mind. This was our third year staying at CC. The new spa makes it ever more desirable. A must if you like ocean towns on the Baja."
"We stayed at Casita del Pescado from Jan. 28-31 2019.  We were absolutely thrilled with our casita!!  For the last 2 vacations to Los Cabos, we stayed downtown in Cabo San Lucas, so we decided to get away form the party scene and try Todos Santos this year.  Through some internet research, I discovered Calycanto Casitas and decided to make a reservation.  We could not have been more pleased with our decision!  If/when we go back, we will definitely stay here again!!  There were 4 of us, so the large house w"

We slept with the patio doors open and could hear the ocean while we fell asleep at night.  When we left the casita during the day, we didn't even lock the doors....we really didn't feel like there would be a problem.

"Well designed, cute, 2 story casitas providing relief from resort life decorated in true Mexican tradition. The pool and hot tub are lovely but the hot tub wasn't turned on for NY eve..a night we wanted to use it. The pool isn't heated so it's chilly. Lovely outdoor kitchen at the pool. There is some substantial lack of attention to detail and prooerty care. Exterior wood needs paint/stain. Inadequate night path lighting  is very dangerous-need many  more working solar path lights. Gravel vs flagstone much "

COVID sure changes everything, but we were comfortable here. It's easy to maintain your space in such a beautiful environment. Everyone was great with distancing and wearing masks.  Even when we went into Todos Santos, everyone was wearing masks, they had the foot sanitizer pads, and hand sanitizer.  Shelby does such a great job at helping you set up whatever activity"
Flora Del Mar is a little hideaway about 5 minutes from the Pacific Ocean in Todos Santos. We had a great time staying in the bungalow. We sipped wine and smoked cigars on the rooftop porch while listening to the ocean roar and staring at the Milky Way. The nearby pool was also a great way to cool off during our summertime visit. 
" provide sharpening stone. No plastic wrap for leftovers.. No working smoke detectors. TV sound horrible. Additional speakers or sound bar needed and not expensive. Yellow stickies with Wi-Fi password and soiled, unlaminated house instructions look unprofessional. BTW..can tap water be used to wash fruits and veggies? Plumbing inadequate to flush toilet paper which must be deposited in trash cans.  Gorgeous remote beach a 20 min walk."
"Our first trip to Isla - We stayed at Esduma La Perla for 6 nights.  We liked the hotel - very clean.    Everyone was very nice.    The breakfast included was amazing each morning.  Rooms were spacious, and a nice sized balcony.   I would love lounge chairs added so we could lay out during the day if at the hotel.  The location is great - walking distance to alot of places, including the beach.     Highly recommend and will definitely be staying again.  Thank you for awesome first trip!!"
 cannot say enough good things about this place. They take such good care of you that you will never want to leave.

"A unique place in the world. We loved the totally empty beach with the most magic sunsets. Marilyn is a fantastic host with a big heart for dogs. One of hem, Lobo, spent a day with us on the beach (not possible to swim/black flagged). Room was very nice, breakfast was very nice, if you want peace and tranquility this is the place. You need a car to get there and to Todos Santos village. We will come back! "
"This was our second visit to Todos Santos - a small town north of Cabo. Here you can escape the hustle and bustle of typical Mexican resorts and bask in the quiet, natural beauty of the southern baja. Marilyn was an extraordinary hostess - very prompt with every question before we arrived and warm and welcoming during our 4 night stay. The rooms were private, supremely clean, well appointed with views of the ocean. We enjoyed star-gazing from the roof top terrace and fell asleep to the sound of the crashing"
"We stayed here for 6 nights during our trip to Mexico and everything was like on pictures. The location of the Arcos hotel is great, near all tavernas, very close to beautiful playa Norte. The only thing which could be a problem is a very loud music from the bar across the street. If you dont mind the music until midnight or so this is a good choice. The staff was helpful but their English is not so good."
…
"Everything was mostly good, except...my friend and i checked in early and went scuba diving. When we got back, we went by the pool and ordered a drink, then went for a swim. All of a sudden one of the staff demanded to know what room # we were in. I didnt remember, the #, only where it was located. It turned into an unnecessary hassle that i didnt appreciate."
"We (my wife and I, and one other couple) stayed here for 5 days over Labor Day weekend. The rooms were basic but nice and clean. We went with an ocean front room with hot tub on the balcony. I think we may have had the best room in the hotel as we got a corner room with 270° ocean views over the Malecon.  We sat out there multiple nights and took in the full moon over the ocean, waves crashing, and amazing breeze.   The staff was super helpful and gave us anything we needed.

"I have had the pleasure to visit Arriba many times I’ve the past few years. It is a favourite destination!  Arriba is located at the top of a coastal rock face  surrounded by beach, crashing Pacific waves and views of the mountain range nearby.  The views are spectacular and we have loved watching the whales migrate from our lounge chairs at Arriba.  The hosts are very professional, and ensure the rooms are clean, sanitary and well appointed.  Fresh coastal air allowed us to stay outside all day and evening"
"You have to drive over rough dirt roads to get here, but the ocean view and quaint surroundings are worth it. Marilyn Martin, the owner, is a kind and patient person who makes sure that your stay is wonderful. The casita in which we stayed was a bit sparse, but we were there to relax and forget he world, which is totally possible here. You can walk to the beach and watch the whales. It is not luxurious, so be prepared for some rough edges at times. But, it is a very relaxing and private spot."
"We had a very nice stay with Marilyn. We had a nice and clean little place to ourselves that included a kitchen and a great veranda where we could just hang out with a beer and watch whales jumping in the distance. The pool was a nice reprieve when the sun got too hot, and the beach is just a 2 minute walk from our front door. This isn't a posh place where you can expect 24 hr service, but instead is a laid back place of rest and relaxation for easy going travlers."
Los arcos hotel is smack in the center of Hidalgo Av. Easy to go do anything. Few walking blocks from the ferry. The room is big with tiny balcony to sit if you like .very clean. All as described at booking  The downside..... the casa musica is right across and later at night they have a screaming loud Alice Cooper type of band  
"Our stay at Caly Canto was amazing! They are true Mexican Casitas beautifully and traditionally decorated to give you that warm Mexican vibe. The beds are super comfy and the homes are stocked with everything you need to cook, sleep, play, and relax. The caretakers are incredibly helpful and on call for whatever comes up. The pool is the best pool in the area! The nearby beaches are endlessly beautiful and the town of Todos Santos is charming, filled with amazing galleries and restaurants and friendly peopl"
"CalyCanto Casitias is a wonderful place to stay as always.  This is my third stay here. Laurie is gracious and has everything perfectly coordinated.  They also just completed an amazingly beautiful pool area complete with a hot tub, bar area and palapas for protection from the sun.  The other bonus is the astounding sunset each night visible from the each casita."
" larger in the pictures than it is. We had very low occupancy, so it was great for our stay, but I could see it being a bit overcrowded if the hotel is full.  We would definitely consider staying here again. For the price we paid, it was above and beyond what we expected. Thanks you for having us."

"We came here for breakfast and I was impressed. The food tasted great, orange juice was natural and this was some of the best breakfast I’ve had in a while. It’s a small area with one server and two cooks but they were attentive to everyone and brought the food out quickly."
"We travelled around the southern Baja for 3 weeks and this was our favourite place by a mile. In fact we drive an hour out of the way to come back and spend our last night of our holiday there.  The ever present sound of the waves crashing, watching the whales jumping and a wonderful hostess, all make this is a very special place.   Don't hesitate to book this one."
"We had a great time at Flora Del Mar!! 7 of us stayed at this out of the way spot (It's crazy to have an isolated beach so close to town!) The place lent itself well for a group experience - a great place to gather with friends and family, and privacy when we needed it. We hung out at the pool - a lot! and met new friends! The owner, Marilyn was so nice and helpful. She set us up with surfing lessons at Cerritos beach and a whale shark expedition in La Paz. We rented the entire house this time around and my"
"Wonderful hotel, close to everything, very clean and spacious. Lovely bathroom with a hot shower..but the bed. The bed was honestly so uncomfortable we were never able to be truly rested. It was like sleeping on plywood. I've stayed other places in Isla that weren't as bad as this. If you can fit it in your suit case - bring a mattress topper.   Also, the wifi barely worked for the 4 days we were there. If you can live without wifi and a comfortable bed - this is your place.   Lastly, the music is loud. We "

"Arriba de la Roca is BREATHTAKING!! This ""top-of-the-rock"" boutique hotel offers unobstructed views of migrating whales, flying fish, beaches in each direction for as far as the eye can see.  Perfect sunsets and sunrises every day.  Shelby and Maurice deliver 6 star service, excellent cocktails and delicious meals.  I can't wait for my next visit! You will not regret choosing Arriba de la Roca.   It's unforgetable!"
"This trip was a trip of a lifetime. The owners treat their guests like royalty and work tirelessly to ensure your happiness. The place was simply amazing. Everyday starts with a brand new sunrise and an amazing breakfast. Everyday of your stay will never be the same because of how beautiful the scenery is.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to fulfill a bucket list wish, someone craving oceanic beauty, or someone who loves to be treated like royalty."
"Excellent place in Isla Mujeres very safe, clean and quiet area. Owner Sadjid was very friendly and￼ Explained everything around the area and where to go and eat. I loved the breakfast in the morning he was fresh and very organic I enjoyed my challa juice With pineapple it was delicious￼. Everything on the menu was delicious.￼ The room is very clean and air conditioning is in very good working condition￼.  Definitely I will come and stay here again.  Thanks Sadjid for being a great hostess￼."
"My husband and I took the bus from Cabo San Lucas to get to Todos Santos, so had no vehicle.  Marilyn took us under her wing and helped us with Spanish interpretation at the bus station, and even got up at six in the morning to drive us into town to get our bus the morning we left.  Marilyn helped us arrange a whale watching outing with the local fisherman which was a blast.  Her property is absolutely gorgeous, with a beautiful pool and lovely landscaping.  We were after a very relaxing holiday, and Flora "
" were excellent, and we enjoyed walking to town and getting fresh buttery avocadoes, juicy limes, freshcaught shrimp and freshly baked tortillas to make our own delicious suppers.   Our daily walk along the beach with Luli and Panchita (a couple of Marilyn's rescue dogs) was a delight.   We both totally enjoyed our stay here, especially the extra attention that Marilyn gave us.  She was meant to run a B&B!"
"Great location, we booked a king room with balcony on the top floor which opened onto the shared terrace .  Lovely spacious room with a massive shower.  You collect keys via a key safe at the front door but your fantastic host ""Jo""  was there if you did need anything.  Location is in the heart of the night life area so either party or take ear plugs."
"If you can get a BACK ROOM for under 45, I'd say yes....If not, STAY AWAY. Great water pressure, Terrible shower heads, lumpy beds & front rooms are The Noisiest on the ISLAND! You can do better than this. Oh, watch out for the on site Price Increase!!"
"This hotel is in the perfect location. Right in the middle of all the action and only three blocks from the beach. Room was clean, super hot showers, and cold AC. This is a no-frills hotel so you have to bring your own beach towels and the only time you see any employee is when they come to clean your room daily. Which they do a great job of. Only complaint I would have is the bed is a little hard. Will definitely return."
Great staff. They helped me with all my needs.   And you get some excellent sunrise views.   Just the right amount of quiet on their side of the island...perfect.  I usually stay at another hotel but I believe Im  making the switch.   Thank you again.  
"This hotel was great.  It is close to all restaurants and nightlife.  We enjoyed being able to sit on the terrace and listening to the ocean every day.  For someone that is used to fast pace environments, this is a great place to settle down for a few days and relax."
"We are regular visitors at Arriba.  We love and look forward to our trip every year.  I call it heaven on earth.  Great views, food, drinks, with great service.  Rooms are clean, luxurious and breathtaking.  See u next year!"
"I have stayed here numerous times over the years. Usually sola, but sometimes with my mom and sometimes with hubby. The rooms are clean, comfortable and have everything I need. Kitchenette, good wifi, great location, relaxing terrace with hammock and it’s quiet. The café in front has wonderful fresh food for breakfast and lunch. The little garden is beautiful and serene. Madjid, the owner, is around for questions and assistance. He is the nicest host possible!!  There are books to borrow, beach chairs and u"

"My boyfriend and I are not super high maintenance when it comes to our trips, so if you are then this probably isn't the place for you.  But anyway, the room is adorable, pretty colors, suprisingly spacious, concrete floors.  The bathroom was said to be tiny, but we didn't have a problem with it.  The shower water would leak through the glass and wet our bathroom floors and lead to the room, but again this didn't bother us. Just wipe it up with some towels and you're good!  We had a cute little balcony that"
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Los Arcos Suites to celebrate his birthday. I have stayed on Isla before  and was closer to Playa Norte, but this room was way better to me. It's located near everything so you can walk around for food and shopping. We also liked that it was very clean and had amenities if you wanted to prepare your own meals. El Patio, which is a restaurant sits right across from the hotel, so late nights we would step out on the balcony with a drink and listen to the live music going on. Staff"
"We are staying here now and absolutely love this place.  It's located on Hildago (the walking street) and right in the heart of the action.  Our room is very big and clean.  Updated and very comfortable.  Great air con and comfy bed.  We love the balcony because we can listen to music from the bar across the way (it's loud so bring ear plugs and you will be alright), people watch, sip drinks and eat breakfast.  The room is equipped with a fridge, microwave and some dishes.  The staff are all very nice and a"
"My husband and I are on the last day of our 6-day stay here. We love everything about this place - the comfortable room (more like a little studio apartment), the nice setting around a lush little garden, the outdoor spaces, the lovely little breakfast cafe downstairs, and the perfect location on a pretty local street close to shops and restaurants, a short walk from the ferry, and an equally short walk to Playa Norte, the best beach on the island. Most of all, the place is a peaceful oasis just a block fro"
"I loved this place! There are only three rooms, so it's always pretty quiet. The rooms are simple, comfortable, and clean. Madjid, the owner, goes out of his way to make you feel at home and tell you the best places to eat and visit. It's an easy walk from the ferry terminal. The breakfast restaurant in the front of the hotel is excellent, a little north of 100 pesos ($5 US these days) for a good, fresh-cooked breakfast with delicious home-made bread.

The important thing to mention is that this place is in the heart of downtown so at nights it gets LOUD.  Bring noise-cancelling earplugs to sleep and you'll be fine.  I slept like a baby most nights and I'm a light sleeper. Another thing to mention is you are right above a restraunt that is always playing music. And they start playing early.

Awesome place in the heart of isla mujeres!  The room is very comfortable and very clean. The location is perfect! We just had to walk 5 min to the beach (Norte) - one of my favorite beaches ! It's beautiful.   Heidy (the receptionist) was very helpful! She gave us good tips to discover the island. We rented a golf car and had a blast! Suites los arcos is an excellent value for price! I highly recommend it !
"First time staying here, its a no frills place, but we don't need frills, just a great location is all and this place has it... I would definately stay there again, its across the street from my favorite bar!!!"
"Our stay at Elements of the Island was incredible! The room was extremely clean and was maintained by a wonderful housekeeper who even changed our bedding half way through the stay.  The air conditioning worked very well and we only had to use it to cool down in the evening before bed.  The bed was so comfortable! Our host was extremely accommodating and gracious, helping us feel at home immediately.   He speaks excellent English and really helped us navigate many aspects of the trip.  The Elements of the I"
Elements of the Island is a wonderful hotel to stay !!! They serve breakfast downstairs and have have housekeeping. In the room there is a T.V. two beds (one big one small) a balcony a tiny kitchen and a bathroom with a shower.They also have 3 air conditioners that are not broken !!!   Thank you Madjid for a wonderful and great stay at Elements of the Island!!! 😀

"This is not a hotel, this is a boutique hotel so you will not likely see staff, you get keys to the front door and to your suite. This place was so cute and oozing with character. We stayed in the Chiapas suite. The rooms are accessible to the left of the Tres Mentiras bar. Our stay came with a free welcome drink which was lovely. The manager was amazing and extremely accommodating.   This place has a narrow staircase and low doorways when you enter, so make sure you can walk up steep steps. There aren't to"
"Biggest selling point was the location: right on Avenue Hidalgo, where many restaurants, bars and shops are clustered. Rooms come with balconies; be sure to request a room ""al frente"" if you enjoy people-watching (I was in room #6). This may not be ideal if you want to sleep before midnight, given the loud music and crowds. A lot of shops and restaurants close up by 12 a.m.  Another selling point: mini-fridge and coffee maker in the room. There's free wifi, air conditioning and cable TV. The hot water tap d"
"Elements of the Island is a fantastic option if you want to have an authentic, pleasant, well rounded experience in Isla Mujeres.   It is nice and central, only a block or two away from everything you need.   Benefits: - The breakfast downstairs is exceptional. We tried lots of things and they were all delicious. It’s also very well priced for travellers on a budget and the service is really good.  - Beach chairs and umbrellas are there to be used for free. This will save you lots of money as the ones on th"
" totally representative of the island and Mexico in general. There were two air conditioners that were not too bad, but could have been better. There is a cute sitting area and there is a little fridge to keep extra drinks or food cold. There was a little closet in the bedroom to hang up your stuff.  Now, this next part has nothing to do with the place itself, but in general it is a loud place to be because there are bars and restaurants all over the island. It will be loud at night regardless of where you "
 less busy but still we found it really quiet and a nice place to have a siesta.  - Golf cart rental is really close and $850 pesos for the day! - There isn’t a view of the sea but you’ll get an epic view of a thunder and lightening storm! - it’s really secure. There’s a locked gate to get into the complex and also separate key for room doors.  - the air conditioning is really good. There’s also a fan and ceiling fan to move the air around if you don’t want air con on.  - bed is really big and on the harder

"My wife and I came back for another stay at Tres Mentiras Boutique Rooms at the end of April.   We were arriving early, and Jo, the property manager, helped us get our luggage secure and coordinated check in.   The hotel has a great location right on Hidalgo, so plenty of restaurants and bars within a quick walk.  And Playa Norte is just a few minutes away.  We always enjoy the people watching and street entertainment from the balcony.  The ""Yucatan"" room is clean and comfortable.  The staff at the hotel an"
 boutique hotel in the center of town is certainly one of our favorite places.

Things were going well till the last day of our trip.  My wife and I came back from breakfast to find items missing from our room and room service had just finished up. I spoke with the hotel manager and he shared that it's been an issue... there you have it! They know what's going on and are OK with it... we'll never stay here or recommend someone else to.
"Me and my husband spend now the Christmas holiday in Isla Mujeres. We choose the hotel because of the beautiful view we saw on the pictures...indeed, the views are stunning, but everything else is truly dissapointing. We observed on our 3rd day in the morning that a reasonable amount of EUR cash was STOLEN from the LOCKED room safe... we have literally traveled the world but nothing like this ever happened to us. The staff and hotel manager seemingly did not care, not even once were we informed after report"
"This hotel is very basic.  For the price and location it's worth it though if you can get past a few things.  Definitely not luxury. The check-in process was simple and staff was decently helpful.  The location is the best part.  It is on the coast with a rocky/cliff view of the ocean which is very beautiful.  It is within walking distance of Playa Norte, the ferry, and everything downtown.  There is no fridge, the drinkable water is located in the hallway, there are no wash clothes or a hair dryer.  When I"
" it'd cost, okay no big deal to pay a little extra for something different.  We ate breakfast out the rest of our stay though.  The Mexican eggs that they served were good though.  A few good experiences: we couldn't figure out our AC and someone came to check it out very promptly.  We had a later ferry off the island and they allowed us to store our luggage past check out time in a secured room.  We met some other guests that were very nice by the pool and community area was great.  LOCATION, LOCATION, LOC"

"This hotel is not for everyone; please research before booking.  I booked a double room with a balcony and “sea view. “   Pros: The staff was very kind and welcoming. Large room with two beds, seating area, closet, and spacious balcony. Great location, close to the port ( ferry), approximately 5-8 minute walk, walking distance to multiple restaurants and the beach. The Isla Mujeres sign ( popular photo spot) is located right outside the hotel. The staff was delightful but spoke very little English. It’s ok "
"I stayed here 1 night but was charged for 3. I called them but they say I stayed there for three which is a BIG FAT LIE. After that, they ignore my emails and my calls. Other reasons why you should NOT stay in this hotel: - No Safe. - No outside curtains so I had to wake up early as the sun hit my face. - Only one employee for the whole hotel - No amenities - When I arrived, there was no one in the lobby, then he didn't even say hi. - No elevator - Rooms are very small - TV has no channels. * Don't waste yo"
"Awful hotel that did not match with the official photos so very disappointed. Bathroom was filthy and moldy, not in a good shape. Room was ok and windows with no views. Try another option if you stay on the island. No real receptionist so doors are full open to the outside. This is not a boutique hotel"
"We love this place but it is a lil noisy when you decide to travel around Christmastime, this place is right across from the ferry terminal. Our breakfast at the hotel was tasty and different form the 4/5 days we were there. Staff was very friendly, helpful and hotel was very clean, not your plush 5 star, but this is our thing!! Absolutely worth referring and returning to."
The hotel is a four story hotel with no elevator and narrow stairs.  It is directly across from the ferry port and is convenient to the downtown area.  Playa Norte beach is walking distance from the hotel.  Great restaurants and bars are also within walking distance. The best rooms are 104 and 204.  These rooms has a balcony and are at the front of the building-good views of harbor.  The a/c units are not great but they do cool the room.  There is no safe in the room.  There is a refrigerator and a tv that

"Quaint accommodations in the heart of Centro!  Very clean rooms, some more spacious than others, and you will have everything you need -- but if you need anything else, just ask (like blankets or beach towels)!  Nothing like having your morning coffee on the rooftop, overlooking the port and surrounding area.  Just two blocks away from Av. Hidalgo and great restaurants and shopping.  Playa Norte is an easy 10 minute walk.  Truly a gem!"
"LOCALIZAÇÃO: excelente, fácil visualização, tudo o que precisar, próximo.

CAFE DA MANHÃ: café,leite, prato com frutas, cesta de pães,  manteiga e geleia, se quiser repetir algo (e xceto café) paga a parte.

The town centre is two blocks away. There is always someone at the front desk to help you. At night, the front door is locked for security and there is a night watchman. It is a bit noisy during the day with all the traffic, but if you sit on the deck and people watch it's quite entertaining. The rooms are clean, comfortable & spacious. Tw"
"In the middle if the centre just 4 minutes walk from ultramar ferry. Close to restaurants, beach and bars. We arrived at 9:00am check in was no problem. Super friendly staff. Nice terrace on roof top. Would go there again"
"Right in the heart of the north end and walking distance from the ferry terminal. Cheap no frills rooms with great views of the bay and beach. Walk across street and you are at the beach. Walk 2 blocks in the opposite direction and you are on the street with all the restaurants and shops. Great for an evening stroll and dinner.  Roof top patio is great. Great views, great breeze, and a barbeque grill."
"Muy buen servicio y trato, especialmente de parte de Nahum, Daiana y Hector. Las instalaciones están muy bonitas, la comida deliciosa y un excelente trato, muy recomendado. Definitivamente vuelvo a visitarlos"
" day. Mexican style cooking great everyday.The Gomar is not the Ritz so don't expect that. What you will get is a great hotel & staff that will treat you like part of their Mexican family if you allow them to. Engage the staff, speak a little Spanish. Don't be an arrogant ars. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. Thank you Frank and staff for another great experience at Hotel D'Gomar! We will be back."

"The Sol Caribe is a unique hotel and quirky hotel in the heart of Isla Mujeres.  Upon arriving on the street in front of the alley way to the entrance, you are greeted with a mild to mid-range aroma of raw sewage. This greeting continued throughout our 4 night stay.  The “front desk” is located on the second floor that requires the dexterity of a Sherpa to get up the narrow 1 person stair case without any handrails to assistance ones safe climb.  We were greeted with a very friendly concierge with limited E"
"The hotel is a clean budget hotel with a nice breakfast, although sometimes the breakfast was not warm. It is located across the street from the ferry so it is easy to get there, and is in a great location for beach and restaurants. However, there is no room safe, and no place to put your close except for a couple of hangers. There is no elevator and the stairs are pretty narrow. Because it is close to a main Street, it is a bit noisy. "
"It is right in front of the port on the main street, so it's quite noisey. Rooms are clean, but the building is disappointing. There is nothing really wrong in this place, but i think you can find something better in Isla mujeres for the price."
" small seat and a makeup table and mirror.   The bed was very uncomfortable and bowed in the middle. There were hairs found on the bedspread along with a few stains.  The bathroom very small everything functioned as expected  There is a refrigerator with cooking utensils, toaster, coffee pot and a hot plate available from the front desk.  There is a roof access with a spectacular view of the harbour and Cancun off in the horizon"
Our stay at the hotel was in some ways better than expected given the price we paid. We were fortunate in that our room was only one flight up as the hotel does not have an elevator. We have been staying in luxury accommodations in general and where trying to economize by staying here. The things that we missed the most was no safe and no shelves or dresser. We started out with 8 hangers but I broke one by putting four shirts on the hanger. On the positive side the included breakfast was quite nice with fre

The shower is small but the water was hot, the lighting in the bathroom was very dim. Just an FYI, There are no English television stations and theFree internet works best in the lobby and by the pool. Our room was on the 3rd floor and there is no elevator, but the you man did help us with our bags. Check in was quick and easy"
"Great place! I stayed here my first time to Isla and it was perfect! Clean rooms, free Wi-Fi, breakfast(eggs, fruit, toast, cereal) included from 8-11am, AC(if you want it), TV in room, safe, mini-fridge, balcony(not all rooms) and very friendly staff. I also liked that they provided a few waters daily for whatever you need, very nice touch. Just a few blocks away from the ferry terminal, minutes from Hildago street and a quick walk to north beach. Would definitely stay here again and will be coming back."
"As the title specifies, why is this a $95 USD per night hotel? Almost 2000 pesos a night?? Carmelina's across the street is 600 pesos a night for 90% of the same thing?  Confused after 2 visits to this hotel & 22 years visiting Isla Mujeres. It's NOT bad , but NOT worth 2000 pesos. Maybe 800 pesos."
This was a very last minute choice as we arrived on a Friday and waited till after 5 pm to start looking for a room (I don’t ever recommend this but even worse idea on a small island beginning of weekend lol) So we scooted around and looked for places to ask about occupancy. My gf got off and ran in. She misunderstood the woman at the desk and we decided to just grab this room because it was “cheap” and available however when we checked in it was more than we expected. $100 usd with no view.  It was downtow

"It is the 3rd time to be here. A real pleasure to be guest at Berny. Nice, clean and safe room. Good breakfast every morning made by a good chef. The front desk amazing. Polite, helpful,  and always friendly.  I recommend even in this crazy time for everybody to take your time and go in vacation and book at Berny, Isla Mujeres.  Certainly I will be back. Thank you, Hotel Berny."
It makes me sad people wrote terrible reviews about this place. if you are on a busy street anywhere when you travel noise comes with the place. It's located above Rolandi's which is an amazing spot and has been open for over 30 years. Each night the staff was sweet since they knew I was staying in the hotel. They remembered my name and my wine of choice each night. I got room #21 which is the best. It's on the 3rd floor which is probably why I had less problems with the noise. It's an old hotel but super c
Third time I have stayed here in room #15. Small kitchen with fridge toaster microwave. View of the Carribean side. Clean rooms simple. 6 blocks from the beautiful North Beach. One block from Caribe side. Small coffee shop across the street. Laundry on the corner. Grocery store 3 blocks. Excellent restaurants 1-2 blocks.

The hotel is very clean and the rooms are very clean.  Housekeeping did a good job each day of keeping the room nice.  The AC worked well.  The cons:  This hotel is VERY old and everything in it is equally old.  The bedspread had stains and holes and appeared VERY old.  We did not have a TV or working refrigerator in our room.  The shower had very little w"
Would return. Extremely nice group of people working here. Was given the room I needed. Balcony with street view.. Upgraded to larger room after a drainage problem.  They are hooked up to the new system so paper is allowed to be flushed. A plus for visitors to Isla.  The beds and linen were great as was the cleaning . T.V was all Spanish except for one channel in early evening. WiFi was good in coradors. Loaded my devise then read in room. Our room was directly over the corner bar. We enjoyed their music wh
"Hotel Belmar is a small hotel on hidalgo street. The location is great, and the rooms are clean and comfortable but the rooms are located above an open courtyard that contains a restuarant. Noise begins at 530am and ends at about 1230am. We could handle the noise until 1230 but it seems that the staff have no regard for hotel guests when arriving in the morning. Out of 5 nights, we were woke 4 nights from about 430 or 5. The restuarants dishwasher was located below our room, when the staff went home for the"
" and was not working and I told the front desk.  They said they would send someone up right away to fix it, however, 2 days later it still wasn't fixed and we had to take the back of the tank lid off to fix it.  Wifi was spotty at best.    I would also advise you do not get any sort of shampoo, conditioner or soap at this hotel so make sure you bring your own.  Also, you will need to bring a hairdryer because that is also not provided.  If you want a cheap, clean place to stay with absolutely nothing else t"
 The nightly rate is thus overpriced.

"The room was well equipped, staff was perfect!  It can get a bit loud (traffic), I'm a light sleeper, a pair of earplugs worked great!  Bar/restaurant a few steps away from my room, as well as a great pool!"
One of the best meals on my trip!  I was surprised at the mixed reviews.  My expectations were not high but I was blown away by the shrimp Mac and cheese. It was fantastic as  was my margarita. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food took awhile but it was delicious and fresh so I didn’t mind the wait.  The other 3 in my group enjoyed their meals as well.
"Staff is completely uninterested and rude.  The rooms have zero isolation and the place and its neighboring bars play ridiculously loud and conflicting music all day.  The music is even worse because of its unbelievably bad sound quality, it stutters and squeaks regularly. Seems they play way louder than their installation can handle."
Fish and chips were a joke.     Could hardly distinguish any shrimp in the Shrimp tacos.    Could have been ground Turkey or minced shrimp because all you could taste was the hot pepper sauce.     Couldn’t even finish one.     Drinks were meh.   
"This place is so much fun. We had the best tacos of our whole trip here. The bartender Justin made some pretty amazing mojitos. Location is great, right on the water. Also just minutes from downtown. Staff is very friendly. You can tell that management really cares. Highly recommend  Damon M"
"I can’t say enough good things.  We had a large group of family that rented the majority of the rooms.  The rooms were cleaned daily, staff were friendly.  Rooms aren’t fancy but we were not in the rooms except to shower and sleep. A microwave and coffee maker was suggested for all rooms. They were receptive to that suggestion and hope they will be there for our next stay.  The food at the bar and grill on site was amazing!  Still thinking about those steak burritos. Yum!!   Servers & bartenders were top no"
No service. Waited over 15 minutes with no acknowledgement.  Prices on menu are were ridiculous. Left for any other place. Service sucks very rude don’t like Americans at this bar with service and cold beer. 
"Wonderful find on the perfect spot mid island. Skulls has a gorgeous property with a pool, bar and restaurant, and a pier out over the water. Chris Fausel keeps things running smoothly and makes sure guests are well taken care of. You won't find a better deal on Isla! "
"The price: My credit card was overcharged for the room and the hotel refuses to refund me the difference for the price I booked. I booked through hotels.com with a free cancelation up until the day prior to check-in. 2 weeks prior to check-in, I canceled 3 days of my original 7 day stay. Instead of canceling the 3 days I requested, the hotel rebooked my stay under a new higher rate and will not refund the difference basically making my stay the same price for 4 days as it was for 7. I didn't immediately not"
Outrageously dishonest.   Bartender brought us a bill at the end of the night for 2 Margaritas that was TRIPLE what we expected.   He knew full well we thought it was Happy Hour when we ordered but he claimed we’d missed it by 4 minutes.   Didn’t tell us that when we were ordering though. And their regular price was 50% higher than anywhere we’ve seen. And by far the worst Margaritas we’ve had on the Island. Orange juice instead of Cointreau.  On top of that he charged us for a drink we sent back because it
 washcloths or beach towels for guests. The office is difficult to find and there is rarely anyone there. There is no table in the room. You have to carry your luggage through the sand to get to the room. Wifi is not reliable. There is no bottled water or coffee maker in the room as advertised.  The location: The only good thing about this place is the location. Do yourself a favor and just walk to the beach instead of staying at the this hotel. I was asked to pay for a chair and umbrella even though I was

"Stayed here on a week tour of Yucatan. 2 nights to see tbe whale sharks. Located on North beach, its a great location with a great view. You walk a sandy path to get to the entrance, which is not marked. You walk by  lot of trash ( which is piled high everywhere in the island)Check in is beside a bar...dank and dark.  Was really happy with view but in morning no place for coffee or breakfast...wifi does not work in room...fridge is on the floor..no coffee maker in room. There is trash around the stairwell t"
"The location is the only thing that can save this place..dont expect bottled water in your room..no coffee maker, fridge to keep your liquids cool,no extra towels,pillows, blankets even if you ask..no safe for your valuables or free breakfast as advertised..and make sure you get your chairs early because they will rent them out to people not staying at the hotel..also they offer covid test for 80usd but I recommend going to the ferry to get them done for 30usd"
"We booked this hotel for 3 nights and couldn’t stay longer than two. It’s very poorly managed. We had to search for the front office and someone to check us in.  Finally the restaurant staff took pity on us and showed us the “back room” in the restaurant to check in. The music from the beach was way too loud into the wee hours of the morning making it impossible to sleep. The hotel rooms are equipped very poorly. No bottled water, no extra towels, no phone, or any extras.  There is no wi-fi in the rooms. Th"
"First the good:  - Great location, right on the North beach - Nice big rooms  The bad  - Despite what they say there is no WiFi. You can't get any in the rooms (you can see some hot spots but they are not theirs). There is wifi at the bar but it never worked...and they didn't see to care. This made it a nightmare for those of us who needed to work, or watch some Netflix before bed.  - The curtains are office style blinds that have big gaps in them. Not good for privacy. Many times I had people glancing in!!"
"Large room, cleaned daily. RIGHT ON THE BEACH. close to everything.  Large smart T.V. (didn't use) to busy outside.  We stayed in #8. Hot Water,  The Hotel could use better Beach Lounge Chairs.  The people of Isla Mujures are warm and friendly and welcome you with smiles,  "
"Great safe, clean hotel for  short stay. Great location in centro, great balcony to people watch from. Very close to 2 beaches, playa norte (gorgeous) & a quieter beach that only locals use (although red flag so cant swim there) short walk from ferry too.  Modern & fairly new i would say. Smart tv with option to log into your netflix account which i thought was a nice touch for a hotel in this price range. Fridge & safe too & decent shower. Dont get breakfast but nice place downstairs to grab coffee & break"
I needed a budget trip to Mexico and had been to Isla a few times. I chose this hotel because of the location I was familiar with and knew it would be safe and lots nearby. Going in I knew it would be pretty basic but it was very clean and I felt safe there. They have a metal door they lock at 11pm. Of course there is a guard to let you in if you are a guest. The young man who was almost always at the front desk seemed to even be sort of looking out for me.  They loan out beach towels. It was never very lou
Prima hotel. Aardig personeel. Top locatie. In de avond wat luidruchtig maar dat wisten we van te voren. Midden aan de leukste straat (Miquel Hidalgo). Prijzen van het hotel zijn niet in verhouding maar dat heeft natuurlijk alles te maken met vraag en aanbod op dit moment. Supermarkt zit direct naast het hotel.
Excelente lugar centrico a 3 cuadras del ferry a 4 cuadras de playa norte a 4 cuadras de playa mía y a 2 cuadras de playa céntrica Habitación amplia con heladera pequeñas airé y tv. supermetcado aki  a 1 cuadra  Buena limpieza y personal atento Sin ruido por estar en el centro aunque la actividad termina a las 23 Excelente relación precio calidad Volvería sin dudarlo
"Un hotel que definitivamente supera las expectativas, cómodo con una temática especial. Un buen lugar para pasar una estancia romántica. Incluye el desayuno continental en Marina Bartolomé y sin duda el servicio de Kathia, es el mejor. Volveremos."
"We have stayed at Casa Barco twice and it has been a great experience both times. The rooms are incredibly clean and spacious. There is a shared kitchen area for the 5 rooms in the house that has everything you need and space to keep food in the refrigerator. They clean your room daily, including clean towels and bed sheets. There is a shared pool on the upper floor of the house that is a great place to relax after a day touring or at the beach. Great location to the north beach and the Hidalgo Avenue, the "
"Buena opción para hospedarse en isla, cada habitación tiene su propia decoración, cuenta con cocina/comedor donde puedes preparar tus alimentos, con refrigerador y todo lo necesario para cocinar. Todo limpio, internet rápido. El personal muy atento, Kathia, siempre al pendiente y amable.  El único detalle, que seguramente está referido, pero no leí, para ingresar, hay varias escaleras, así que si sufres del alguna discapacidad, o carriolas, etc, hay que considerarlo. De ahí en más, excelente ubicación, muy "
Très jolie chambre confortable dans une grande maison partagée. Idéalement placé à 5min des bars et restaurants et du terminal de ferry. Eau potable à disposition dans la cuisine partagée qui permet de faire son petit déjeuner soit même car l’hôtel ne le propose pas.
"Pasamos una noche en Isla Mujeres y elegimos este hotel por su situación y precio, la verdad que no defraudó. La habitación limpia y las chicas de recepción muy amables. Está a 10min andando de Playa Norte, cerca de muchos restaurantes y tiendas. Repetiríamos sin dudarlo!"
"Este hotel es una excelente opción si quieres tener un buen lugar, céntrico, y a un buen precio !! Está a una calle de ferry, a dos cuadras de la calle en donde están las artesanías y restaurantes y a pocas cuadras de la hermosa playa norte!! La decoración es muy muy linda y la habitación con espacio suficiente!! La cama y almohadas cómodas !! El único “detalle” es que no cuenta con restaurante o servicios, pero la verdad si vas a conocer la isla, no resulta necesario . Tienen convenio con una alquiladora d"
"I booked a private room with bathroom. It was very spacious and had fridge, TV, AC, hangers, table with chairs, glasses and cups etc The sheets are super soft. The water pressure is great! There is hot water right away! I could here music from the street in the evening but it didn’t bother me. In the night it’s quiet! The hotel is on the main street with restaurants and shops. Beach is 5min away by foot and there is a supermarket 2 blocks from here. Can really recommend!"
"This small hotel is located in the centre of a busy pedestrian zone but our room never noticed much noise. The room was small but clean, staff were helpful and friendly and wifi was available in the room. There is no restaurant or cafe attached to the hotel but there are many options within meters of the hotel that serve great food and good entertainment.  We took a taxi from the ferry but it really is only a 10 minute walk if you take your time, as the hotel is in a pedestrian area you still need to walk a"
"The husband and I booked a studio room for our 2 week stay on Isla Mujeres. Being a regular on the island i had a good idea of whats available and what to expect. This hotel is the perfect little oasis in the center. The hotel is close to all attractions within walking distance but still quiet and safe with a gorgeous tropical garden.   We had the top floor studio that was spacious, clean with lots of sunshine coming from all sides. Oscar and Cassandra were very welcoming and spoke good english. We choose t"
Right downtown so that  we could walk to everything from the ferry to North Beach and to shopping and restaurants. Staff was very helpful. Small place but clean and had refrigerator and table...and they provided other items upon request like hair dryer and toaster and snorkeling equipment. It was very good for price. We only missed an outdoor place to sit and it was little noisy at night till about 11pm.
"The hotel is well located to bars, beach and restaurants. I also felt quite safe and the room was clean. Having the mini-frig was convenient but the hotel offers no coffee.  They only provided two bath towels per room. No hand towels, washcloths were available. The few hangers and lack of hooks was also something they could easily remedy. I would also suggest having more than one mirror in the room as the only mirror was a small one over the sink.  Little things could vastly improve this establishment which"
"Staff here is wonderful and so helpful- they quickly booked us a snorkeling trip and assisted us with getting our covid tests before flying home. Hotel is quiet, peaceful, very clean, and the complimentary breakfast and coffee was so nice and light- fruit, toast, jam, and coffee. This is on the quieter, south side of the island. We will absolutely be returning here!"
"We wanted a short getaway in Isla Mujeres and accommodation that would be comfortable without breaking the bank. This place did the trick. Our room was big and comfy and had a cute balcony overlooking busy Hidalgo street. Bathroom was clean. There is a fridge in the room (a bit noisy) and a coffeemaker which gets replenished every day. The AC worked really well and was very quiet. There is no common space for use in the posada but at this price, who cares? Staff was helpful and let us drop our bags before c"
"A magical and homely place, right on the waterfront. Authentic and with personal service and a hug from the staff. Private beach. Stunning room. Everything is natural and special. A place that preserves the ecology and natural balance of the island."
"I stayed in Isla Caracol after ages of trawling through places on booking apps. So glad I decided to stay here. The staff are so amazing. Especially Yvette (Yvette, un dia espero que vayas a India 😊!). The breakfast is pretty basic but does the job. The rooms are really nice. It is a nice chilled place and only 10 mins walk to playa azul. All the main restaurants and shops are close by. I would definitely stay here again. "
"Quiet little hotel on the south side of island. Perfect little place for a reasonable price. We got a whole week for an extremely low price. Plus, every morning George would make coffee and an entire plate of fruit for breakfast. Recommended"
Stayed a few days last weekend. Very simple but a perfect fit for our needs. Stayed in posada 8. Little balcony overlooking Hidalgo. Very friendly staff. Would stay there again. Had difficulty booking for a Sunday checkout but a little tweaking to their website on their end and it worked great. Easy to email and communicate.
"I spent two nights and found it Ok but definitely overpriced. 50 Eur seems like a lot for a simple room - but then again, Isla Mujeres is probably one of the most expensive places in Mexico. I like the silent AC, the decent WiFi and having fridge in the room. Also, the location is central and still surprisingly quiet. I did not like the high price so much (this was a last minute booking and I didn't seem to have much choice at booking.com) and the fact that they make up the rooms between 15:00 and 16:00 - t"
"I stayed at Coco B for 2 weeks during a yoga teacher training and had the most amazing time. The place really is as beautiful as pictured. The place itself, the ‚private‘ beach, the staff, the food… loved everything and would definitely come back!"
We normally stay all inclusive and 5 star properties. Wanting to visit Isla Mujeres for my wife's 50th birthday on a budget we did our first not all in for decades. My wife wasn't keen on a airbnb yet wanted to dip toes in stages by booking a hotel. We were attempting a budget Trip. Air Miles to get here flights. CanaDian transfers met us at airport to shuttle to ferry and we arrived downtown. The locals wanted taxi money gave us bad directions walking blocks. In reality this place is leave the ferry termin
"My wife and I have visited Isla several times and this time we decide to stay on the ""less busy"" side of the island.  The hotel is very clean and organized, the rooms are large and there was plenty of hot water in the shower.  Each morning we were treated to a very nice breakfast of coffee, fresh fruit and toast.  There is ample room to park your golf cart.  The swimming pool was very clean and refreshing.  Note that finding the resort for the first time may be a bit of an issue since it's not on the main r"
"We needed a room for the night and this was perfect. We had a room on the 1st floor, simple yet clean. A shower/bath, bed TV, mini fridge, table and chairs, and air conditioning. The room was clean - what more did we need and only $55.  We would rent here again. Thank you"
"I was really impressed with the cleanliness of this place, the room and bathroom were both spotless and the room was well equipped with.... wait for it... (this almost never happens in Mexico) - QUIET air conditioning!  Clean linen and towels in good condition, a large size fridge, comfortable bed and pillows.  Yeah I guess the room was kind of 'internal' with a strange window looking out to I'm not sure what (they had a curtain behind it) but it was still well lit and did not at all feel claustrophobic.

"Spent 4 nights at this small hotel.  I know we’re are still experiencing Covid, so my expectations are mindful of that.  First the good: - Staff friendly and accommodating - Location is great, close to beach and restaurants - Reasonable price - Good A/C  And the not so good: - No wifi in the rooms, despite listed on the booking sites - Mattress covered in plastic, not very comfortable  - Housekeeping lacking, no service first 2 days, shower door never cleaned  - One towel was ripped in the middle and staine"
"I hosted a yoga retreat at Coco B in October and it was absolutely wonderful. Everything about the experience at Coco B exceeded our expectations. Lisa and her team were attentive, kind, and helpful. If you are looking to host a retreat here, you will not be disappointed-- they assisted me with everything from setting up the booking page, transportation, excursions, and everything! I will definitely be going back to host a retreat here again. Thank you to everyone at Coco B!"
 is by luck not a heavily driven one you'll see in evening is quiet. Your walking distance 1 block to a cheap breakfast I recommend called big Daddy's. Good American style and less than 100 pesos. Turn left out the door and your 1 block from all the major streets with shopping and restaurants. We highly recommend the Italian mama Rosa the mushroom risotto is sooooo good. Filling portions. Heavy. The joint has happy hour and amazing house wings. 2 blocks to Playa Norte the amazing beach. If you don't want to
"We stayed here for two nights.  The rooms were comfortable and the location quiet on the south end.  Sergio, the inn keeper, was always ready to help us and very friendly.  Breakfast was toast, coffee and a nice fruit plate. Rates were reasonable.  Tip: access to the tub was treacherous.  Hang on to the grab bar to avoid slipping."
" Mujeres without being noisy.  They don't have a card machine so you need to pay in cash for your stay else they offer paypal.  Cute and quaint with a boutique feel, so much nicer than a chain hotel!"

Friendly and helpful staff, roomy rooms, good a/c and excellent shower pressure, bed was very comfy, refrigerator  - lots of pluses.

"My wife and I visit Isla Mujeres at least once per year.  We were married on the island and have come to view it as our ""home away from home"".  Over the years, we have stayed at many places on the island, but Villas Cocos is our favorite place to stay.  If you are visiting the island to get drunk and party hard every night, Villas Cocos is likely not your ideal place to stay.  My wife and I come to the island to relax, and in that regard Villas Cocos can't be beaten!  Located on the more secluded side of th"

It is central, quiet and an easy walk to Playa del Note and the ferry. They kindly upgraded me for free to a room with a small balcony. 2 queen beds, decent sized bathroom, TV (although I never used it) in room fridge and safe, plus fan and air conditioning. My only concern was that after booking via one of the booking agencies, I always contac"

Worst service in the world!  We arrived at the hotel room and saw that the water in Niagara was not going down the toilet.  We went to a receptionist. She brought the maintenance man and he tried to repair.  After two hours we tried to lower the water again but again no water and pumping in the toilet.  We asked to move to a room where the restrooms had been properly serviced and claimed that they had no available rooms.  After telling her we were paid and we couldn't be in a room without a toilet she offer

"The hotel overall was an amazing stay. The place is very cute and quaint. The rooms themselves were really nice. Open kitchen area, very nice big clean beds and the bathroom area looked very newly done. Was really impressed! The location was great, off the main road and just a few minute walk to the beach. A great place to stay - the prices were also amazing for such a nice hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating as well!"
"Hotel Isleno is a perfect setting for a quiet vacation.  Located just a block from the East shore, its an easy walk to North Beach, the ferry terminal and all the hub bub in downtown Isla.  The rooms are clean, bright and better than you might expect at a budget-priced hotel.  This is a family-run operation and everyone was friendly and provided perfect advice on where to eat.  We loved living like a local!  The only drawback was stability of the Internet, but we got connected when needed (why work when you"
I'd been working with the staff and property owner since early 2020 and had to wait till 2021 to come with my group of 24 women. Lisa was wonderful from start to finish and without her I'm not sure we would have had such a great stay. Thank you Lisa - this review is for you and because of you! Yes the onsite staff are lovely and as attentive as they could be. And the Chef made thoughtfully prepared meals to accommodate everyone's food issues. That was above and beyond! I wish the staffing had been more seam
Nice place fairly clean and the service was good in the afternoon. The morning guy was a little short but ok. If you are like my wife and I and just like to go to Isla and it doesn’t need to be fancy this is a good place.
We stayed here as a couple for 4 nights & 5 days and loved it. Very quiet and clean. Staff was nice and attentive. Very nice clean pool .There is a bar where u can order beer and drinks. Breakfast was good. Toast and fresh sweet fruit. Coffee was a bit strong and juice was delicious. Needed some eggs or meat and would have been perfect. We rented a golf cart for our entire stay there as u will need one to get around the island. I liked staying on this side of the island as the north end was busy crazy and f
"The hotel itself was beautiful and very clean. Rooms are well-sized and finishes are great. Location is close to a lovely beach club (1 minute walk) and it is very easy to get around the island. Reception / concierge was very helpful with organizing taxis, questions about the island, and anything we needed relating to the hotel rooms. I visited with friends and they easily accommodated a large group."
We couldn’t have found anywhere more perfectly located ! Literally 5 minutes from a couple of beaches and also with all the bars and restaurants on our doorstep to wander around in the evenings soaking up the live music and amazing cocktails!  The hotel is tiny but the service is great  Clean towels everyday beach towels provided and the bed changed every other day ! Fresh coffee every morning and gorgeous cake ! The staff are so helpful !  Would have no hesitation in recommending
"For sure one of the best holidays I ever had, with staying at this hostel. Extremly kind stuff.. Clean! Caffe and cookies at the lobby for good morning or any time of a day. You can take the towels to use them on the beach..beach is quite close. Free wifi in rooms with PC for a free using at the lobby. Tv with hd channels. I would recommend this place to anyone who plan to visit Isla."

"I've stayed at this location multiple times and have thoroughly enjoyed every single stay. The rooms are very clean and organized with air conditioning, the beds are super comfortable, and bathrooms are elegant.   This is great for family trips, couples, or larger groups. The receptionists are very accommodating and any questions/requests are immediately resolved. I will continue to stay here every time I visit the island!"
"Small 10 room hotel on Av Juarez, convenient to everything. 4 rooms on 2nd floor, 4 on 3rd, 2 suites in 4th. No elevator, but staff will haul your luggage up & down. Very clean, small balconies, minifridge & microwave. Breakfast is strong coffee, tea, fruit, toast & cake/donut. 24 hour staff mostly speaks English. A great buy in town – will be back. "

"A long drawn out discussion regarding my booking they could not find and where they wanted to charge twice the price, that my booking was for- Got room 1 with dirty tissues on the floor-access via dirty kitchen with sink full of dishs with mouldy food and flies. Shower/wc under the stairs-poor quality. Saving grace was staff pleasant and near to Zocalo, I was also allowed into the room before 10am. There are a few other budget options you will pass if coming from ADO bus station."
"If you are like us and like to explore and have space that feels like home - this hotel is for you. They were very nice & the hotel rooms are quite spacious. The amenities included are quite amazing for the price you pay - the access to free breakfast at 2 locations on each end of the island, and pool access at one and beach club access at another is great (just note for loungers at the beach club they require you to spend about 600 pesos on drinks/food). They had fresh filtered water waiting for us and poo"
"Very reasonably priced. Better than the Holiday Inns back home. Super clean , coffee fresh buns bread toast apples bananas for breakfast.  Hot water great pressure.  Kind staff 24 hours.   Upscale bathrooms . Fridge granite counters and tables.  Wifi is good.  We stayed in room 1 with a balcony. Rooms at back have a high walled terrace.  Beds are comfy.    They also rent out golf carts which we did. Located on Juarez at north end.  Short walk to several beaches"
"Good location, within a few blocks from the main square and just a block away from the supermarket. Very basic room, a bit rough on the edges, but bathroom was clean.  A bit noisy due to traffic; better have some earplugs."
"Arenas has at least 2 different venues; one is in the city center, the one we stayed at is up on a hill off the main highway.    Pros:   - they had the only vacant room left in the city (that you could find on-line) during the Cumbre equinox festival at El Tajin;  - room was clean;  - removed from the crazy traffic in town, so quiet except for animal sounds; - the view from our wide window was wonderful: the hills, the blackbirds in the trees, the roosters and chickens below;  - window in bathroom; - bathro"
"The Room: We stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bath family suite for 4 nights and it was perfect in every way. Anytime we needed anything during our stay, we would simply walk around the corner since the main office is next door to the family suite and speak to Angel or Damian who were both very helpful. The hotel does provide pool towels which is fabulous, you just need to ask for them. The family suite was absolutely perfect for our family of 5 with our son sleeping on the pull out couch and our girls in the 2nd "
"I just got back from a ten day stay on the island.  This location is prime due to its easy access to the North Beach and other prime locations.  The rooms are clean, large and stocked with your toiletries.  My room, number 8 was perfect since it had a balcony facing the back.  Not much of a view, however it was located in the front of the building.  Our view was of the backyards to the locals.  They provide a continental breakfast which will include your coffee, tea, fruit which is usually an apple and at t"
" pane in bathroom;  - no breakfast provided; - a non-service attitude overall;  - no ability to take a credit card but required payment before arrival.    With a bit of money and a credit card terminal, this could be a good budget choice.  I would recommend it if they would care to fix up the small things.  I had wanted to stay at La Quinta de Los Leones but they were full.  I can't vouch for the rooms because they were occupied and could not be shown, but one of the workers there gave us a tour of what had"

Big shout out to Damian at the front desk who went above and beyond to help us secure a golf cart with 2 forward facing seats (which are harder to find)! He had it get delivered to the hotel, took our payment, and everything. He even communicated with me on Whats App to let me know it arrived!  You can park your golf"
" You will need to request beach towels in advance since they are hard to come by especially if you drop it off after every trip to the beach.  The Wifi isn't so great unless you are in the lobby or 2nd floor area.  Despite this, you will receive a clean room, great hospitality and a place that will speak volumes in location!

"We stayed at Hotel Kinich for 11 nights over the holidays.  Our first night we were given a room where the safe did not work.  We were given a choice of rooms the next day.  We ended up being on the 3rd floor that had a balcony overlooking Juarez.  The staff, especially Eduardo, is very nice and helpful.  We were provided beach towels as needed throughout our stay.  The room was large with ample space for storage.  There was a dresser, hangers, and other space for clothes.  There was a rain shower in the ba"

"Les photos ci-dessus datent certainement d'une période prospère de l'hôtel mais nous y sommes allés le 2 août 2016 et nous n'avons pas pu y dormir!! tout est désaffecté et horrible! mobilier abîmé cassé, les serviettes et draps pas propre et le personnel sentait très mauvais et nous n'étions pas en sécurité ! nous étions avec des amis qui avaient réservé mais nous avons décidé de partir trouvé un autre hôtel; le personnel ne nous a pas remboursé mais c'est scandaleux de trouver sur internet ce type d'établi"
"We stayed 4 nights here and would have stayed longer if our schedule permitted. The room and bed was comfortable. The room, hotel and outdoors areas are kept clean. The WiFi worked  well except for a technical fault which was beyond the control of the hotel and they got it fixed quickly. This is a basic hotel but it met all of our needs. We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor area listening to the birds. We were happy that we did not stay at a hotel in the town centre. Taxis only cost 20 pesos into town so we ha"

"Just got back from an eleven night stay here. You couldn’t have a better location for access to all the bars and restaurants in the main area. It’s not five star but it’s not five star price either. It’s clean, comfy with hot water and cool aircon. We just want somewhere to rest our heads and get a shower when we holiday. Don’t need luxurious surroundings for that. If you travel on a budget and like value for your money you’ve found the ideal place. "
"Necesitaba un hotel para dormir y seguir el viaje a varias ciudades, en internet se veía no tan mal pero al llegar fue decepcionante, solía ser la casa de un obispo en algún tiempo está pegado a una iglesia, es lúgubre y antiguo, las recámaras nada cómodas y muy descuidadas, nos dio la impresión de ser inseguro aunque no tuvimos  contratiempos, fui con la familia, definitivamente no regresaría "
"Атмосфера романтичной запущенности и былого величия. Такое чувство, что они не доделали ремонт - нет ни одной вешалки в ванной (а были), но комнаты большие со шкафом, тумбочками и столиком с зеркалом. Старинная роскошная усадьба с выходом к неоготическому собору на холме, 3 этажа очень странным образом переходят друг в друга, в холлах рассыпающийся рояль, пыльный бильярдный стол, старинные предметы неизвестного назначения, резная массивная мебель.

"El hotel es muy sencillo, pienso que el precio de $500 por noche es caro para lo que ofrecen, realmente no tienen ningún servicio adicional, las habitaciones no tienen aire acondicionado, sólo un ventilador, y la verdad es que hacía calor en abril. No está tan cercano al centro, talvez a unos 10 minutos en carro."
"This place is expensive, dirty, old. And not pet friendly (in the description it stated pet friendly) So if you love yourself stay away.  Later dont come back and say it is not true. BTW this picture was taken in somewhere else, or was ages ago. Today the ""garden"" is full of junk and an unfinished building. Dont trust me? good luck!"
"Este hotel engaña con su publicidad, pues se presenta ubicado en la zona centro, pero está en una colina apartada a diez cuadras de la plaza principal; además, ofrecen lo que no tienen, como el estacionamiento que es en la calle, en un lote baldío cercano sin vigilancia. Igualmente la televisión en cuyos canales nada se puede ver ni oír por estar cargados de interferencia. Dicen tener bar y sólo es un refrigerador con cervezas y refrescos. En booking.com dicen que es nuevo, pero es un hotel viejo descarapel"
"We stayed one night in the Hostal de Moncayo. It is a short (5 minute) walk from the zócalo and thus close to everything you need, but quiet at night. Rooms have a nice view out over the town and are clean and comfortable: while a bit basic they have everything you need. What really impressed me was the attitude of the owner, Gustavo, who was helpful and went out of his way to assist us when we left behind some papers in our room, ensuring that we got them back safe and sound. If there is nobody about when "
"I stayed 2 nights in order to visit Papantla and go to El Tajin, the place is simple, the owner is friendly and interesting to talk with. It is located 10 minutes walk from the bus depot which is a big plus, also only about 10 minutes to the main square"
"Love, love this hotel! We have stayed here on 4 different trips and will stay here next time as well. The staff is so wonderful and welcoming. Gabriel is a gem. I had several questions and changes in the months leading up to our trip and every time I sent an email he was so helpful and quick to reply. The location of the hotel is great. Very close to the supermarket, restaurants and beach. Beach chairs are provided, which we love! The cleaning staff does a great job on keeping everything clean and sand free"
"What a wonderful oasis.  We recently spent two very enjoyable weeks at XBulu-Ha.  Our suite was well-appointed, comfortable, and spotlessly clean.  The hotel offers a quiet respite close to the vibrant centre of Isla’s main village.  It is also just a short walk to the beautiful North Beach.  Gabriel and his staff are friendly, welcoming, and accommodating.  It is a happy place and we look forward to returning."
Do Not listen to the guy who is saying bad comments about this Hotel. I have stayed in many Hotels on Isla Mujures over 35 years. This is a Very Good Hotel. Honestly! The rooms are very clean. Great staff. Quiet and one of the Best Boutique Hotels on the Island. Rourke Howard
The worst experience ever they had roaches no water and worst customer service ever very rude in the front desk. I tried to get the managers name and they said they didn’t need to give me that information and find out myself. It looks like the room was not cleaned properly the bed looked like the sheets we’re not changed and they couldn’t even put new shampoos or soap in our bathroom when requested then they said they would  send them and never got them.
"Quaint little no frills hotel. Clean! Cold AC, hot water. Friendly, accommodating staff. Close to the beach and Hidalgo. Beach towels provided and beach chairs are available first come first serve. This hotel cannot be beat for the price."
"We stay for two weeks in this Hotel which is very close to North Beach. Excellent staff! Super clean! Anel was super helpful, she gave us tips to venture around the island and recommend local Restaurants. Also, the owner Gabriel was at all times checking on us, making sure we were satisfied with our stay. Housekeeping did a great job, our room was spotless everyday! The location is just at the right spot, you have all amenities near by without the noise of being around the bar areas. Just a block from the m"

If I could leave zero stars I would. 100% the worst customer service I’ve ever entailed in my whole life.  Stayed for 2 nights and they tried to charge us for 3. Miscommunication due to language barrier on both parties- the receptionist started shouting at me during our conversation about checking out and laughed at us in our faces on the phone to the hotel owner. I’m so disgusted.  On top of that- we had no water in our shower the first night and no water to flush the toilet the second. No WiFi in our room
 kept our deposit when we didn’t use their room. Extremely money grabbing. We aren’t made of money and they acted disgustingly.
"Las cabañas son amplias, pero llega muy poca agua caliente a la regadera, los Desayunos los preparan  a partir de las 9am.  La piscina no tiene buen mantenimiento. La atención de recepción es muy mala, tardaron mucho en confirmar la disponibilidad de las cabañas que reserve.  El último día y aún cuando todavía no desocupábamos, enviaron al servicio de limpieza indicando que la habitación ya tenía que limpiarse.  No, no recomiendo este alojamiento. "
"leí sobre este hotel en la revista de México desconocido, decidimos reservar el hotel y al llegar nos dijeron que estacionáramos afuera, enfrente de la puerta... a las 9 de la noche empezó a llover y se desbordo el río sobre la calle.. la corriente se llevo los carros de toda la cuadra, incluyendo el nuestro... al día siguiente nos dijeron que siempre se inunda esa calle, que nos debieron avisar por parte del hotel. Terrible experiencia, no se hospeden aquí!!!"
"Es un hotel antiguo. Los pasillos son muy calientes. El primer día estuvimos en la habitación del segundo piso y fue muy ruidosa. Después nos pasaron al cuarto piso y la situación mejoro un poco. En la primera habitación el aire acondicionado era muy ruidoso y las toallas estaban sucias, pero en el piso 4 todo mejoró. Esta a una cuadra de la plaza principal, pero es de subida y es agotador. Considero que es caro para lo que ofrece."
"I stayed here for 4 nights as Hotel Tajin was fully booked.  Room price was not too bad M$350 and the sheets were clean and beds were comfortable.  The hotel and rooms are rough round the edges and dated and the walls are dirty.  There are some weird smells in the rooms and the landings.  I stayed in room 110 first night and halfway though the night was woken up by the smell coming through the window from outside, methane/petrol.  Pretty nasty.  Moved to 203 which was better but still had its own odour.  St"

En un entorno en el que las aves entonan sus adorables cantos, entre árboles tupidos de naranjas jugosas y dulces que, si lo deseas, puedes tomar del árbol y comerlas; rodeado de plantíos de vainilla, café, canela, cascadas, pozas, ríos y paisajes que a veces creemos que ya no existen a nuestro alreded"
"Great location, right dead center in downtown Papantla. Only a few minutes ride in a cab to El Tajin. Cold AC and hot water. I gave 4 stars because the view we got was of the hallway and the you need to turn the water on about 25 minutes before you want to shower to let it get hot. Takes forever. There are a few rooms (1-5) that have nice balconies overlooking downtown. Pretty view. Otherwise you will get an interior room with your window looking into the hallway. The staff was friendly. Helped us when we n"
"I stayed here only one night, arriving late (1am) and leaving early to visit El Tajin (taxi from Zocalo MXN70, taxi colectivo back for MXN15 per person). Check-in was quick and confusion over the room I was assigned (which had not been cleaned and prepared) was quickly resolved. The room's air-conditioning was effective and had a wall-mounted Tv which I did not use. The room itself was very basic (cost approx MXN550) and the Internet worked ok but not great and with limited range. It's location could not be"
"papantla is a  nice town that we enjoyed visiting. The Provincia Express is clean but basic, no restaurant for food and the window of our room could not be opened to ventilate. We ate at the nearby Plaza Pardo which was good and it has a lovely view of the parque/ zocalo "
"This hotel is perfectly placed overlooking the very active main plaza where the voladores can be viewed from a front balcony room. Very clean, staff is very helpful, the a/c works, all king beds in the front rooms. The hotel referred a local Totonac guide for a vanilla plantation/horticulture experiment green house for a 2 hour tour. The guide is also available for touring many local attractions at a very reasonable price. Restaurants and vanilla retailers next to the hotel, El Tajin is a 15 min taxi ride a"
"This hotel is probably the best in town, with the best view if you get a plaza facing room. There is no hotel parking but if you are patient enough you can find free all day all night parking right next to the hotel. Very conveniently located near everything, shopping, restaurants, etc. Check supplies when you get your room, just in case!  About $700 Mexican pesos per dat for the best room."
"We spent one night here before visiting El Tajin archeological site. The hotel was clean, right on the plaza and comfortable. My one word of caution is to request a room away from the lobby. It was very very noisy at night. From our bed, we could hear the front desk phone ringing and hear people talking. Other than that, it was a great place to stay."
"Reading the reviews, I decided to stay there. Here's what I didn't like: Hard to find, no signs outside... it's on the first floor, no elevator and no one to help with the luggage No hotel parking or special rate, extra cost of over 200 Pesos nearby (100 pesos 9PM-9AM +15 pesos/hour before or after) Included breakfast was still not ready by 10 AM... another 170 Pesos expense at the restaurant next door. Safety risk: the railing keeping you from falling down a staircase on the way to the room has no grid wha"
"I moved to this hotel after the disappointment of El Tajin. At the same price, there is no comparison in quality. Provincia Express is much newer, nicer, more comfortable. "
"I would go back to the Hotel Provincia Express in Papantla in a heartbeat. It was about $50 USD / night, and had a prime location right on the zocalo. If you get a room facing the zocalo you'll be able to see the voladores fly out your window, which is a truly remarkable experience. The staff was super friendly and the wifi and AC were very reliable. Room and bathroom very clean. I highly recommend this hotel."
"Stayed there last December for 1 night while visiting El Tajín. Clean room and batthroom, Wifi included, and friendly staff. Probably the best bang for the buck in Papantla."
El hostal no está funcionando lo rentamos para hoy 20 de julio 2020. Cuando llegamos estaban un grupo de trabajadores instalando techo y remodelando en general!! Mucho cuidado!! Lo compramos en Booking.com ahora tenemos que ver como recuperar nuestro dinero 
Gustavo was awesome.  He went above and beyond to help us with renting our cart and answering all of our questions.  Check this place out if you want to be treated like you matter to him and his business.
"if you are looking for Party and Music this is not the place to stay, this is a Beautiful and Relaxing Place, for people that wants to be quiet and enjoy stunning views of the Ocean and Mountains,  The Villas are Beautiful and their pools are just wonderful. the beach is not good for swimming and need to be careful with the rays.

"Bahia Villas is located about 10 miles south of Loreto itself in a delightful community, Loreto Bay.  We stayed in a two bedroom condo which was immaculately clean and had a full kitchen and several outdoor spaces for lounging.  Beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen was well-stocked, allowing us to prepare our own meals.  The resort is right on the beautiful bay, making it easy for walks on the beach, fishing from shore, snorkelling, and kayaking.  The village of Loreto Bay had a bakery/coffee sho"
"This is in a great location, literally just down the street from the square, restaurants and Alamo rental car. The lodgings were immaculately clean and well equipped and had an ""observation deck"" with great views of the mountains. Parking is in their courtyard and the rooms came with coffee, creamer, breakfast muffins, fridge, stove, free internet."
"I just spent a week at Bugambilias and was very pleasantly surprised. The rooms are spacious, and fitted with high quality furnishings. Everything you would expect from a high end hotel right here in downtown Loreto.  he real benefit is the full service kitchen complete with everything you could possibly need. The hotel is located just off the main boulevard, and convenient to grocery stores. A short walk to the downtown square, and rooms have bicycles for those wishing to explore further. Overall, a great "
"Great price,super clean, excellent staff, easy walking distance to most shops and restaurants.  Off street parking with locked gate evenings.  We couldn’t be happier with our stay.  Coffee service  in room and fantastic air conditioner.  "
"Perfect spot in Loreto —- in town near restaurants, coffee, music and shops. Oralia is so kind and helpful, assisted with kayak and SUP to the beach. Highly recommend. Super clean, and the WiFi is very good. Already booked a week for the holidays, excited to return to Loreto"
"Clean, functional and perfectly placed, what sets the Bugambilias Suites Hotel apart is the lovely people that run it. They could not have been more helpful and friendly. I would definitely return when I return to Loreto."
"Villas del Santo Nino I want to take a minute to give praise to Villas del Santo Nino in Loreto.   We have stayed here a couple of times and enjoy it even more each time.  This time we spent almost a month with our kids (6mo and 2.5yo).  The Datil I was just perfect for us, it has 2 rooms and everything for us to live there and also feel like we are on vacation!   The hosts Oralia & Francisco couldn't be better.  They acknowledged every concern we had (which weren't many) and met every expectation we had wh"
"We loved our stay at this hotel.  Very clean and well maintained hotel with great customer service.  Beautiful sunset views from the rooftop.  Although it's not on the beach or around the town square, it's easy walking distance to those places and the price was very reasonable. The only problem we had was the battery was dead in the in room safe.  But when I reported it, they had it fixed within a couple hours while we were out. Will definitely stay there again."
" The property is kept clean and tidy at all times, the beautiful flowers and plants look great and add to the beauty of Villas del Santo Nino.  They have a fleet of bikes for your use! They organized a dinner to be cooked in their garden that far exceeded our expectations.  We asked if we could have dinner cooked for us one night and the result was a gorgeous feast for almost 20 people for a very reasonable price.  The chef and assistants came with a BBQ, chairs, tables, and a couple people helping.  The fo"
Stayed here for a couple of nights on a driving trip through the Baja. This hotel is just perfect for travelers. Secure gated parking in the courtyard. The hotel is only 3 years old so the rooms are like new and immaculate and have everything you need. Very well laid out and super comfortable. Hotel is a short walk into town and very quiet at night. Staff are super nice here with a warm welcome from everyone. We loved it here.  Highly recommended by Oldbackpack.
"we love this place and Loreto.  The room was well equipped and very clean.   The staff is simply amazing, very friendly and kind.  Location is great. The parking is safe and free.  Don't lose the terrace!   Highly recommend."

"Very well kept, clean property with attention to detail.  Our room was equipped with kitchenette, microwave, good size fridg, a/c & ceiling fan with lights.  Beautiful built-in closets; nice bed.  Lovely potted and vining plants enhance the area.  Roof top sitting area with city views. Walking distance to restaurants and the Malecon.  Wonderful proprietor--sunny disposition and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again."
"The location is excellent, near the sea and the Mission.  The hosts are very friendly and seek to make the stay as pleasant as possible. Close to good restaurants, it is an ideal place to be in Loreto. I understand that you can stay for a weekend or for a few months"
"My husband and I travelled around Baja for 5 weeks last January.  We both fell in love with Loreto but particularly Villa Santo Niño.  Our hosts, Francisco and Oralia were the perfect hosts, paying close attention to details and making sure we had everything we needed.  The studio and the grounds were spotless and the kitchen was equipped with everything you could think of. The studio was located just a few minutes walk to the central plaza and to the beach on the Sea of Cortes.  We had access to bikes, kay"
"This is comfortable, clean, safe, and welcoming.  What else can you ask for?  Kitchenettes that are well stocked, free parking, and free use of bicycles. (not sure if all rooms have kitchenettes-check on this when you make your reservation)  Also the staff and owners are beyond wonderful."
"Sto Nino has a special place in my heart. The warmth of the owners, the charm of the rental units, the fabulous central location, between the central plaza and the Sea of Cortez, all come together to make for the perfect vacation rental. Chato and Oralia are perfect hosts who greet each day with a smile, help you with your plans and are enthusiastic to hear about your adventures! They have become my family in Loreto."
We found this to be a very pleasant and convenient hotel. We were concerned it was not by the beach or looking too cute but it turned out to be just right for us. Very Comfy bed Clean bathroom with hot water and great pressure. Best thing: body lotion for sunburnt skin (ours got confiscated at the airport but there are plenty of pharmacies in town)  Fully equipped kitchen though we didn’t use it as there were plenty of nice restaurants in town. However if you are planning a longer stay of fancy cooking brea
We love coming to Loreto and staying with Oralia and Chato. We wanted 6 months but my wife passed away. Her 3minths here last year were some of her happiest. I returned this year at her request with gifts. 
"Villas Santo Nino are a true home from home. The owners / managers are called Oralia and Chatto and they both go out of their way to make your stay with them as comfortable as can be. All  the accommodations are very well equipped plus good Internet and  TV. They also have a collection of coolboxes, collapsible chairs plus snorkelling gear for the use of guests, plus bicycles and kayaks again for the use of guests."
"An appreciation of the Villa Santo Nino  begins with the location.  Less than a block from the town square in Loreto and a short distance from the Sea of Cortez the Villa's are in walking distance from great restaurants in Loreto including those with views of the Ocean. The grounds of the Villa's are a beautiful desert garden, when you leave your Villa your are surrounded by beauty.  We have been in two apartments and both were furnished and decorated as if they were some ones home rather than a rental Apar"
"My partner and I have stayed at Casa Mangos twice.  It's a beautiful small hotel, in a great central location.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable.  Liz is an amazing host and helped us in so many ways.  She is fluent in Spanish and just an all round wonderful person. The breakfast is an added bonus!  Yum!  As well as the bikes available to get around town.  It's our go to place when we come to Loreto.  Highly recommend!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jeff and Linda's. They, along with Cyndi, were amazing hosts and helpful in every way from suggesting wonderful restaurants to helping us book fishing and touring activities. Our room was perfect and we enjoyed using the bikes to get around town. The location was great for walking to town. We even used the shared outdoor kitchen to grill the fish we had caught earlier in the day. We highly recommend and will absolutely stay there on future trips to Loreto"
"Casa Mangoes is a great little hotel. Only 5 (I think) rooms, very clean and comfortable. The owner, Liz, is very friendly and accommodating. It’s a great location, close to the malecón, the plaza, and lots of restaurants. Would definitely stay here again."
"Love this place!  Spending a month this time, and enjoying every day.   All the wonderful amenities mentioned above, plus the luxury of on-site massages by excellent masseuse Heidi.  Jeff, Linda, and Cindy ensure a great time is had by all guests.   They are also very Covid-19 safe with masks, extra cleaning, and all other precautions one would hope for."
"Large property with only 4 rooms The furniture was nice Rooms are large and the location is far enough away from the town the it is quiet. Having  access the bikes was great. The beach is less than 2 blocks away, I was able to run on the beach every morning. We were the only ones on the property. It is safe and secure. Cyndi checked in on us from a distance to make sure were had everything. The AC hot water and fridge all worked well. There is a fully equipped kitchen available for longer stays . The best f"
"We had a quick weekend getaway in Loreto and stayed at the beautiful and relaxing Casa Mangos! Liz and her assistant Vicky were incredibly welcoming and helpful, and the property was immaculate and very well appointed. Only a couple blocks from either the beach or the plaza, everything you might want to see in town is within easy walking distance, and if you are more adventurous they have nice bikes you can use as well.  Breakfast is included at Orlando's down the  street, and they have great food and frien"
"Wonderful small hotel near the beach with everything you could wish for.  Owners Jeff and Linda have thought of every detail, including lovely grounds, excellent pool, well-furnished large rooms, great showers, and super-comfortable beds.  Resident Cindy is very helpful with explanations and local suggestions.  We will return for sure!"
My husband and I couldn’t have asked for more during our recent week long stay in Loreto.  This location is quiet yet within minutes of the malecon and the central part of town.  As of October 2019 a taxi from the airport is a standard $21.00. We lucked out in that a gentleman asked if we’d like to share.  The property is gated and Cindy who is the resident manager greeted us and showed us to our room (Pacifica) on the first level at poolside and explained all the amenities.  We had a king size bed and kitc
" crazy nightlife kind of place that Cabo is, but it is more zen and traditional. Very, very nice.  The Casa Mangos is a fantastic hotel and run even better! I strongly recommend that you  consider Casa Mangos for your next Loreto vacation!"
" Direct TV and DVD player, as well as reliable wifi.  In addition to the cooking space in our room, we had full access to the open air main kitchen which was part of the original private home. The pool area was attractive and very well maintained with padded lounge chairs for all and thick pool towels.  There was also snorkeling gear to borrow and towels for the beach.  If we chose we could have borrowed a paddle board. We were steadily reminded and encouraged to ask if there was anything we needed.  In fac"

"I almost don't want to write this review because I'd like to keep this place my little secret! Absolutely loved this gem of an inn. Run by Linda and her husband, retirees from Alaska, this place made us feel at home. We were the only guests at the time so had the place to ourselves. There's a big community kitchen well stocked with dishes and common cooking needs (oil, salt, etc) and a fancy coffee machine that makes a really tasty cuppa. The pool offered refreshing respite from the heat of the day. The bea"
"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our 5-day paddle trip around the islands (see Sea Trek Baja).  It was perfect for us: having our own little studio apartment just a couple blocks from the plaza, with easy access to everything but removed from some of the downtown music at night.  We especially liked morning and evening walks along the sea, breakfast down the block at friendly Orlando's, the tasty ice cream and frozen juice-pops next door, and a variety of fun restaurants aimed at either visitors ("
"This place is wonderful.  Linda and Jeff, owners and Cindy, manager are fabulous.  They bend over backwards to do what they can to make your stay pleasant.  The once private family home has been turned into a 5 room boutique hotel.   Our room was large, with a kitchenette, huge walk in closet,  large tile shower and king bed. The rooms are quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  The pool was just outside our door and the spacious outdoor kitchen was just across the way.  They have bikes and kayaks for gues"
"We had a lovely 3-night stay at Casa Mangos. Immaculate condition. Loreto was easily accessible from our unit, the ""Manila"" room. The courtyard is relaxing and provides a break from the sun on warm afternoons. We rode bikes (provided) around town - perfect for easy exploring. Breakfast provided a short walk away at Orlando's Restaurant - also a treat. Liz, the owner, and Viky, her assistant, are accommodating and knowledgeable. Good parking out front for a full-size van. Loved this place."
"My long weekend at Casa Mangos was fantastic! I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of the town so close to the comfort and quiet of my studio in a charming setting. Accommodation was very clean, filtered drinking water was provided as well as bikes for exploring the town. Host Liz provided great contacts for sea and land activities. Breakfast at Orlando’s was a bonus. A definite YES for another vacation!"
"Stayed several night in  the Casa and would certainly do it again.  Location: close to the central plaza and malecon of Loreto with lots of restaurants and several travel agencies.  Room: Generous, clean and nice design.  Bed is big and comfortable. Quiet during the night.  Infrastructure: there's a hamock as well as well as several seating options if you want to relax. Water for free.  Breakfast: delicious. You can get it at Orlando's, just a few steps from the hotel.  Host: Liz was very sweet and did ever"
"My stay at Casa Mangos did not  disappoint! It is such a lovely small, well-maintained facility and the owner and her staff are happy to help you navigate the town, find the best places to eat and explore, as well as hooking you up with boat rides for pleasure or fishing with the best in their business.  Breakfast is included six days a week at Orlando’s restaurant just one block away – – an extra that is much appreciated but not obligatory.  The hotel is centrally-located near the plaza and walking distanc"
"Wow!  I'll start with the good.  The views & seclusion of this place were amazing. The waves heard from from our door step...  The high speed internet that we had wouldn't send an email (SERIOUSLY).  This is after calling before hand to make sure Villa Linda Mar had stream-able internet.  We are travel nomads.  Listed on their website is a heated pool.  Not only is this pool not heated, it's absolutely gross.  It's like stagnant water.  You can't even see through it.  It just hasn't been maintained at all. "
" kayaks - they do.  We found out later that we were unable to go in the garage to get them because it was too dangerous.  This meant the kayaks were unusable to us.  When we nicely sent an email to Linda asking for a refund on the remaining days of our stay.  She not only denied, she didn't even respond to us.    The internet was so bad that we had to move & take matters into our own hands.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't book this reservation.  You will not be pleased & at this rate -- you'll be able to find a"
"tienen dos secciones de habitaciones y me quede a espaldas de la mision de loreto cosa unica que lujo , pero me costo 340.00 la noche con aire frio y internet gratis, la verdad valelapena, para que gasto 10000en los hoteles de lujo."
"Paradise Villas is a large building about 3 blocks west of the beach. It is about a mile north from the main square on Francisco Madero, a street that directly intersects the pedestrian portion of the main square. Recommend having a car. There are several apartments and #2, where we stayed was on the second floor with a balcony facing the street, a living room, dining room and kitchen and a separate bedroom and bathroom. It has DISH TV and some of the channels are in English but most in Spanish. The kitchen"
Después de unos maravillosos dias con ustedes. Quiero agradecerle a cada uno de los empleados que nos atendieron y en especial a Antonio parte de los Bell boys team. Todos fueron muy amables. Muchas gracias por todo. Claro que volveremos en la primera oportunidad.
"THE HOTEL OF NO RETURN! We went out to see the place with our friends who were checking it out for their wedding. We had to do a ridiculous timeshare presentation that my wife and I ended up bailing on because our “rep” was simply just bad at his job. The grounds were nice, but the employees literally clueless on multiple levels. First, they only care if you buy one of their intentionally convoluted timeshare plans only purchased through “points.” Second, you can’t depart when you want to leave! They all sa"
everything about this resort is top of the line..from the super service from the front desk staff to the sizable rooms to views and golf and a get away that is impossible to make any better...Danzante is world class
"I love this place. The setting is beautiful, and Mariana (the owner) and friends have done so much to create a hospitable, lovely, safe campground for bike tourists, backpackers, and ""overlanders"" in vans and other very SMALL solarized recreational vehicles.   There's a cute open-air wooden cooking trailer, clean restrooms with lovely tilework and hot water (you must light the hot water heater 5 minutes before a shower--not a big deal), and a few communal plugs for charging phones/laptops. There are also a "
"Newer  all-inclusive resort in a quiet, safe and friendly part  of Mexico. Staff throughout the resort was great. Food good ;entertainment nice and a beautiful golf course.   Resort was busy but did not feel crowded. Only thing missing was WiFi in the rooms."
"Manny is the best elite pool waiter to have at Danzante Bay Villa Palmar resort. System allows for wireless calling of wait staff for ordering and paying so you are not on “Mexican time” ( which is good for you, too!)."
" annual Whale Festival in March). The only amenity lacking for low-footprint campers is a laundry facility, but there are several big sinks and a clothes line for travelers to handwash and line-dry clothing items.   Note: There are no hook-ups, but your boondocking experience/solar camping experience is enhanced by flush toilets and showers, chairs and tables, bbqs, kitchen area with shared fridge, and well-lit common areas."
"We stayed in FN320, which is a two bedroom two bath unit. Both bedrooms were well appointed and comfortable. The bathrooms were stocked with everything that we could need, and the water pressure was great. The kitchen had everything necessary for an extended stay, and even had board games in one drawer!  The unit itself was very quiet and it felt like we had a great deal of privacy. We barbecued on the 2nd floor patio a couple of times, and often enjoyed morning coffee on the 3rd story balcony. Two bicycles"
"-The combination of terrific amenities, location, and hosts is hard to beat.   -The heated pool, minutes walk to the beach, well-designed and newish property, and connoisseur pizza chef hosts, are just a few of the details that make your stay in Loreto as effortless and rewarding as you could want.   -If you’re coming to visit Loreto, or just passing through on your way to another destination, do yourself a favor and check to see if Dome Suite Domes has availability, and stay there if you’re able to."
"Great place to stay when in Loretto. Just a block north of the malecon, behind the Hotel Santa Fe. The outdoor patio is a gathering place. The two rooms are spacious, clean, with large bathrooms. Very reasonable prices and extremely friendly owner. You don't need a car to walk to the mission, restaurants or boat marina, but if you have one you can park in front.  We will stay here again. "
"Location, location, location and may I add Host, Host, Host.  Not only were we central to everything we wanted to do while in Loreto, we had the best advice and hospitality one could hope for. Bruce and the cats made sure our needs were met.  The only place we will ever stay in Loreto. After a successful day fishing, Bruce connected us with a restaurant that was willing to cook our fish for us.  We could have used the BBQ at Mi Cortez Zone  but it was more fun to go out and celebrate. A great place to stay "
"We were booked here because of overflow at other accommodation and were sweetly surprised.  It was clean, quiet, peaceful and had a cool vibe supplied by it owner expat Bruce from San Fran. We spent most of our time outside on the patio surrounded by beach artifacts, flowers and big communal table. Location was perfect for strolling around town, seconds from the beach and marina. Be sure to check out Bruce's friends bar up the street, The Giggling Dolphin. We are still longing for all that the Sea of Cortez"
"One half block from the marina and beach, tucked away off the main drag of Loreto is the perfect hideaway spot to stay in Loreto, ""Mi Cortez Zone"".  Nice, roomy, clean suites at a great price!  You won't find a better deal in town!  Your host Bruce, gives you all the local knowledge you will need to navigate the town, go fishing, golfing or just see the sights!  Relaxing and quiet if you like or if you want to party, Bruce knows the best local spots to hang out!  I've been now 3 times and won't stay anywher"
"After a very long tiring drive, my husband and I were looking forward to booking into an accommodation mentioned in Rough Guide.  The place had only one room available and it was more than we wanted to pay.  The proprietor suggested we try Bruce's Mi Cortez Zone.  We found our way there and were welcomed into a roomy, clean and quiet place at a price much more in keeping with our budget.  We stayed for only 3 nights in Loreto but could have settled right in at Bruce's.  He provides a fridge and barbecue on "
"I recently spent a most relaxing week at Mi Cortez Zone in Loreto, Baja California, Mexico.  The owner, Bruce Rodger was very knowledgeable about the area and intrumental in arranging a fishing boat for us.  The rooms, ""A Suite One"" & ""B Suite Two"" were both large enough to accomodate 4 people comfortably and the bathrooms were enormous with great showers. Outside the rooms is a large palapa covered patio that is a great place to enjoy cocktails or barbeque the fish you catch!  You cannot beat the location."
 to return to this inexpensive gem!

"My sister and I stayed at Mi Cortez Zone for one week, which were last days of October this year.   Mi Cortez Zone is a two-suite property, and we each enjoyed our own suite space.  The suite / room accommodations are spacious and well appointed.  The bathrooms are very large with fabulously large shower areas.  The host, Bruce Rodger,  is an incredible combination of conciege, musican, artist and world traveler, who will guide you to all the best local restaurants (be sure to go to the Gigling Dolphin rest"
We were just passing through to our final destination and found this place by chance.  Having RV in the title is a little deceiving.  They do have RV spots with full hook ups but it is a little community of housing and just an open parking space for the RV’s and Campers (which worked well for us for the night).  They have full hook ups which can be hard to find on the Baja.  Access to the swimming pool and a small private beach area for the residences.  The shower and bathrooms were clean and in good repair
"Super tight spaces and much maneuvering to wiggle in because long term people park their cars and toys all over the place. The pool was closed and it was too far from town to walk, and we paid a whopping 525Pesos per nite. That worked out to $35 Canadian!  Dogs outside the park howled, and fought all night - needed ear plugs. On the plus side, people were friendly."
"Love to see the gate locked at night.  One of the safest and secure parks in Baja!  The mgr printed my insurance policy (corrected) for me and gave me the best directions to leave at the end of my stay.  Great location, walked to town for a great dinner at Super Burro!"
"Pro:  clean, hot showers, on-site laundry, nice people, fast response to pay for the site Cons: VERY tight/crowded, not all amenities/facilities work at any given time (pool, BBQ, bar/restaurant, laundry machines, etc.), problem neighbor that lives in 3-story orange home at left side of park, no real beach access (just access to launch ramp and rock sea wall), no response to inquiry about when something will be fixed or when an amenity will be ready for use, oh and VERY tight (sardines come to mind).  If yo"
" the price.    Our disappointment was in the price being a bit too much for inconsistent amenities and having to deal with the neighboring 'home' built too close to (or rather 'in) the RV parking spaces and the owner being a bit aggressive about his territory.  This is not an RV Park for anyone that wants a view or good beach access or close access to Loreto itself.  This is a good park for big rigs that are staying for a month or more and spend a lot of their time watching their TV.  Loreto, however, a ter"

"We stayed in the RV park for a few days in December while on our way to Los Barriles. Its a great little well kept park on the beach. The ocean view is blocked by condos but other than that we enjoyed our stay. Staff, residents and fellow RVers were all very friendly."
"This is a small RV Park associated with many permanent seasonal residences, permanentes as they are known down here in Baja. The RV spaces are on gravel, flat, and have 30amp power which is nice when AC needed in your rig. The showers were great. Clean, hot, nice pressure. The Wi Fi was poor, weak service and the site was a bit pricey for Baja at almost $30 USD per night. Easy stroll to the beach and nice for dog walks and Sea of Cortez sunrises. No restaurants within easy walking distance."
"We were recommended to go here by a fellow that used to live here. When we arrived off the street the fellow in the office was very helpful. We got a great spot a short way to the beach. Also, the other guests were extremely helpful and so nice.   they also gave us 10% off for being a good sam member."
Had 2 perfect weeks at the Casa del Sol. We would recommend this beautiful fully equipped casa that has 2 bedrooms that sleep 4 with all the comforts of home. The view from the patio is exquisite. It is wonderful to wake up to the beautiful sunrise and go to sleep to the picturesque sunset. Thanks to Dan and Gail who have a vast knowledge of Loreto and surrounding areas.
"We spent just one night in Quinta Bonita, arriving late and leaving early, as Loreto was just a stop on our journey. We were impressed by the cleanliness of the room. The price was quite reasonable for Loreto, which tends to be a little expensive in general. Vicky was very welcoming and friendly. She gave us recommendations for restaurants. We drove to the tourist area, though one could walk in less than thirty minutes. Overall a very nice experience."
"riding my M/C into loreto and we passed the hotel saw some other canadains waving. great luck as i would have missed it .we spent 1 night in a old hotel in the centre of town. came back the nexy day to meet our new amigos and booked in for a few days. super clean and very fresh. nice family owned hotel. did a day trip to the Mission San Javier(awesome) next day fishing and snorkelling,we are now a group of 5. they helped us find a restaurant that would cook or fish,very helpful."
"We were traveling from California to Los Cabos and Loreto was part of our road trip.  My father-in-law had stayed here about a year ago so we stopped here for the night.  We met the owner who is very personable and showed my wife and I the rooms available.  We stayed in a two room, three bed suite.  Very modern, spacious and well designed rooms.  My in-laws stayed in a suite with its own living room area.    This is a newly built, large two story building with parking immediately in front of the room and th"
"We spend the month of may in a luxury suite and our experience was simply perfect. The John and Lani's place is wonderful and we got a exceptionnal service from them.  Complete satisfaction, we will be back next year!"
"We have stayed in ""wow"" home rentals all over the world and John and Lani's place is a winner. Normally we prefer to rent a small home, but we found John and Lani's place offered more and cost less. It was the kind of oasis we need before and after a day full of new experiences. The property is beautifully designed, private, clean, and colorful. Dome Suite Domes is clearly designed and managed to provide privacy and/or sociability on the guests' own terms. There are five units, two of which are domes, plus "
We stayed for a week November 3 thru 10-2017 . Upon arriving we were met By Lynn (owner) and she showed us around the property and our unit . The Mango deck has good privacy with a distant view of the ocean. It is a short walk to the shell and sand beach and town.  The unit is just right for 2 people very comfortable and clearly met our needs. Randy and Lynn provided bikes  for us to ride to town .  Randy on our first day was very kind to take us to the store so we could pickup some groceries and take us to

We stayed in the upstairs terrace room, Cuarto Atardecer, which had french doors to a private balcony with an outdoor light, two chairs, and a small table.  Our shared terrace was quite large with two tables, lounging/reading chairs, an equipped outdoor kitchen, areas for sunning or shading, including a big platform bed for lying under the sun or stars, and pleasant lo"

It was a very quiet restful stay and We can not say enough about our excellent Hosts Randy and Lynn as well as the house keeper who did our laundry and kept our unit clean daily.

"Clean comfortable rooms in the historic center of Loreto. Great location, can walk to everything in the town. Hostal is located a block off the main road so it stays very quiet at night. Abel, the owner, serves coffee in the morning and loves to chat about the history and things to do in Loreto. Highly recommended."

"What a great travel experience! A real hidden gem! The domes are truly works of art and a cozy pleasure to live in. They have most everything you would expect in a fully furnished apartment. John and Lani are warm and gracious hosts. They are bilingual and helped a lot with finding tours and are a wealth of local knowledge. As a swimmer, the heated lap pool was a real plus. The internet is super fast. Located downtown, Domes Suite Domes is a 10-15 minute walking distance to bars, restaurants, beaches, and s"
"Our host was wonderful.  We felt right at home.  The room was large, clean and comfortable.  The communal kitchen was a plus.  The best thing was the location.  We walked all over the touristy part of Loreto with ease.  This allowed us to visit many nice places to eat, the malecon, the beach and the Carnival.  I am so glad we chose this spot to spend some of our vacation.  The only downside was the lock on our room never worked properly but the outside gate was always locked at nigh so it was not really a c"
"I really enjoyed the all-you-need in this really nice, spacious condo 'Tequilla Sunrise'.  Lots of amenities- big kitchen, living room & bedroom with ensuite.  The property has a wonderful view of sunrises, beach, Islas Coronado & Carmen plus includes a hot tub & chilled pool. With an added bonus of using a bicycle to get into town square (approx -10 min bike ride). Lynn & Randy have lots of contacts for birding, fishing snorkeling & restaurants++.  I plan to go back, if they have room!"
"I found Casas Loreto Hostal to be a wonderful place to stay! Abel runs a very good place, it was clean, I felt safe as I was traveling alone. I loved that it was so close to the main square and the beach! I can not say enough about this place. It was my first time staying in a hostal and if all are like this, I will never stay in a hotel again!!! LOVE IT and Abel (super sweet and interesting fellow!)"
"We rented Tequila Sunrise for 2 weeks. It is comfortable with great furniture and bed, wonderful lighting and everything we needed in the kitchen.It has Gorgeous views of the Sea! We loved the hot tub and the outside areas. We were thankful for the bikes. We went everywhere on them! They also have a double kayak, noodles and yoga mats. Our place was cleaned everyday and they did our laundry! Lynn and Randy arranged our transportation and our sight-seeing trip around Coronado with a wonderful, local fisherma"
"From reasonable prices, a central yet quiet location, and a clean and comfortable room, I was delighted to stay at Abel's hostel.  He's a great host: friendly, fluent in English, knowledgeable about where to find great food and attractions, as well as being so welcoming that I immediately felt at home and had gained a new friend.  Loreto is a wonderful location for a vacation, and I know I'll return to Hostal Casas Loreto again. Hopefully, that won't be long in coming."
"My husband and I spent a week at the Hamman's with friends.  This was our first time in Loreto, and didn't know what to expect, but I can say that I am very happy we chose to stay at the Hamman's over the many places that were available at Loreto Bay.  The Hamman's property is tranquil and beautiful, while the places at Loreto Bay are primarily condo/townhomes stacked together and the streets packed tightly with  cars and people.  Not exactly my idea of a relaxing vacation atmosphere...    The Hamman's prop"
"stayed here because of the location. very old and run down,paint peeling off the ceiling made me get out of bed . mattress on a block of cement. maid was nice and the owner very helpful they were willing to open a back courtyard for us to put our motorcycles in a safe place.i think at one time this was the place but it just having in there now."
"Abel has made his life's dream come true with this hostal, providing a reasonable priced save place to stay for travelers of all walks of life.  When I stayed there for a week before guiding a trip to the Gray whale breeding lagoons and the Sea of Cortez, I met two couples biking from the US to La Paz, as well as a young family traveling with their two small children form the Yukon Territory.  We cooked dinner together in the small kitchen and swapped stories over morning coffee freshly brewed by Abel . Abe"

The Hammans live on the property and were very helpful when needed, but they also kept to themselves, allowing us and our friends to privately enjoy their beautiful oasis during our stay. There was no one staying at the Mango Deck during most of our stay, so we pretty much had the place to ourselves.   As mentioned by others, the place was very clean, comfortable, a"
Loreto is quite nice for a day or two This little hotel had good price rooms-all rather shabby but locations central and the upstairs terrace is a relaxing place to watch the world go by Not hugely clean but fine Rooms don't lock but all felt safe!
"As other people have noted here, this place has seen better days. I'm not sure why they can't throw a coat of paint on the walls in the room. The location is great, and with a bit of TLC, this place could be perfect, but to lie in bed and stare at the water stained ceiling, and the stained up walls makes it a depressing choice. We got a room in the building across the street from the main hotel, as we were told that you could have wifi in the room. The first night was some wifi but, by morning it was gone a"
"We stayed in Loreto for about 5 weeks and tried three different places to stay- we were by far the happiest at our final choice- Casas Loreto. The situation is perfect, the rooms are comfortable, clean, and stylish, and the price is good. Lots of hot water, and plenty of excellent coffee in the communal kitchen. Best of all is the owner Abel whose vision made this wonderful place. If we return to Loreto I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!  Muchas Gracias and many hugs to Abel and Estella for a wonder"
"Quaint four room boutique hotel located in the heart of Loreto.  It has a very friendly vibe partially created by the lush garden area surrounding the rooms.  Fanny is wonderful…. Azul, the parrot, doesn’t care for motorcycles. Lol. We were able to park our bikes inside the gates… not much parking for autos in the gate, however.  The rooms are spacious and very clean. Our room had a small kitchen. The shower was great. WiFi was good. We were here during the NORRA 1000 and our room was quiet!!! Amazing!  We "
…
"I agree with the previous reviews.  Hospitable hosts, homemade Mango jam upon arrival, comfortable, and clean accommodations.  Daily laundry service and I am in Nirvana!!  I am still here, so don't be jealous.  Lynn and Randy provide coolers, bikes, and snorkel gear at no cost.  We stayed in Dolphin Cove for $350.00 a week.  It was all we needed, on the smaller side but very well appointed.  What a great price, our friends had the larger unit Tequilla Sunrise.  It featured a full living room, to be honest, "
" room was light up brightly all night. In a way it's a typical down and dirty experience, which can probably be easily avoided by finding a better option in the neighborhood. We ended up moving right next door and it was only slightly more expensive and way nicer."
"We've been visiting Loreto for a few years now and Hostal Casas Loreto is always our first and only choice. Abel is now not only our host but also a dear friend. He makes you feel at home.  The location is excellent. Close to everything! Rooms are clean and cozy, comfy beds a/c and wifi available, and the shower is clean spacious and always warm.  The kitchen is a life saver when it comes to saving some money and stay in for dinner some nights as well of preparing our own breakfast. Coffee always there in t"
"Just came back from Abel Casas Hostal Loreto. Besides being spotless, quite lovely , reasonably priced and in a fantastic location,  the Owner, Abel Casas,  is a wonderful person. Smart, funny, kind, and supremely helpful. I wish I was still there. I stayed in a regular room and then when I came back I stayed in the suite to treat myself to a little extra room. All the bathrooms are huge with very good hot water. The kitchen space is communal and there's always really good strong coffee. I highly recommend "
"Right. No valet parking, no tiki-bar, no 6-star restaurant.  Just well-appointed comfortable rooms with basics for breakfast, shaded portals for relaxing and reading, and the very best of hosts--Steve and Fanny could not have been more pleasant, helpful, thoughtful and  kind.  Readily available for answering questions, providing suggestions or merely inquiring about our health and happiness in such a sweet town. Only a block from the Plaza--and really everything you'd want is within easy strolling distance."
"We stayed in the Mango Deck casita for a week in November, our first time in Loreto. The accommodations were nice, very clean, bed was comfy. Walking distance to town square, restaurants, shopping. Beach is steps away, but mostly gravel, not really beachy. Lynn and Randy are genial and helpful hosts. Lynn's welcome gift of mango jam is great! Amenities are good, everything works...would be nice to have basics like cooking oil, plastic wrap,and tinfoil provided, that you could replace when used...housekeepin"

"Not a bad hotel for the price - rooms are clean, wifi worked well, service was good. However our room faced a noisy street which we could hear clearly and the porch light outside shone through a window without a covering. Three double beds and a big shower in the room were nice but wouldn't stay for more than a night or two. Seemed like an old place in need of some fixing up and the noise was very unpleasant. "
"We spent 2 nights at the end of our week in Baja at La Damiana, and couldn't have been happier with the location, facilities and service! The inn is two blocks from the beach, just about across the street from the plaza and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. There is a lovely courtyard, with ample seating, flowers, shady spots, and the kitchen/dining area was well-equipped. The manager worked with us to make sure all of our needs were met."
Casas Loreto is a very clean and quiet hostel with spacious personal rooms. Abel was thoughtful and lovely to talk with and we were pleased to be able to have access to the kitchen. And the fresh roast coffee in the morning is a huge plus! Would definitely recommend.
We picked the Iguana Inn because it was in a Baja guidebook not really knowing much about it really.. But we found it to be a wonderful place to spend two days. It's small and intimate. The owners Steve and Fanny are gregarious and know the Baja Peninsula inside out. I wish we could have stayed longer.
"Recently returned from a one-week stay at Iguana Inn. It was delightful! The location was great, an easy stroll into el Centro and the beaches. Our lovely casita and the beautiful grounds were cute, clean, and comfortable. Our hosts, Fanny and Steve were incredibly friendly, present, and so helpful. I wish I could have stayed longer."
"We stayed a few days in this centrally-located budget hotel.  M$400 for a double room.  This place has seen better days, with everything a bit worn.  Upstairs rooms, not on the street side, have a nice view of The Mission.  There's wi-fi in the lobby.  But the late-night noise, drunks and other altercations, spoiled our stay and would probably not stay there again.  (A much better place - which we discovered at the end of our visit - around the corner is Hostal Casas Loreto!)"
"Quaint, charming, feel-at-home B&B, perfectly located right at the center of Loreto, 2 min away from its main restaurants and shops, yet surprisingly quiet at night. Open kitchen, if one needs to cook breakfast or something more substantial. Delicious little garden for relaxing. The owner is wonderfully friendly and was very helpful suggesting visits in town and around the region."
La Damiana is very close to the main road and beach making it easy to walk to all the great restaurants and shops. Rooms were comfortable and clean. Staff and owners were kind with great recommendations. A nice perk was the filtered water!
"Had a great time!! Nice big room with a great lighty bathroom and great shower. The kitchen is free to use and there is everything you need to cook for hours. Abel, by the way, is a great host and is willing to talk to you about everything, and he can do other stuff to let you privacy if you don't want to talk. Hostal casas loreto is a great place to stay from 1 night to 2 weeks, it feels like home."
"We stayed at Iguana Inn for 5days, they were recommended by SEA Kayak Baja with whom we spent a 6day 5 night tour to the islands off the coast of Loreto. This was our first trip to Loreto and didn’t have a clue about travel in and around Loreto. Steve and Fanny gave us instruction on how to get there by taxi from the airport and once there, we were greeted by smiles and hospitality till we left. We stayed there 3 days prior to our kayak trip and 2 days after the trip, they put our luggage, clothes, and othe"
"The only reason to stay at this hotel (or motel) is if you get very late to Loreto on your way to another place, and you just want to sleep a few hours without spending to much money. That is exactly what happened with me, otherwise, if I had the intention to stay for a a couple of day in Loreto, I would choose a better place. Junípero facilities are on both sides of the street, facing each other. Rooms can be very noisy if they are over the street, which is the main traffic street in Loreto, so you better "
 Backpackers may like it.
"We have stayed at La Damiana Inn at least 6 times and it is always a great experience.  The rooms are tastefully decorated, clean, roomy and the beds comfortable.  Debra and Geraldo are the best, they know Loreto and offer their local knowledge.  The garden has many areas that offer places to relax.  The community kitchen gives you the opportunity to have a leisurely breakfast and meet the other guests before heading out for the day.  We wouldn't stay anywhere else."
" great day spa which my wife thoroughly enjoyed!!! One morning we even woke up to fresh squeezed orange juice by Steve. For trips requiring a taxi, the host called trusted taxi drivers that got us to locations in a timely manner. The rooms were clean, the water was hot, the beds were nice, and we were walking distance to anything in Loreto. We felt safe and secure in this little Oasis. The only thing that they didn’t have was a swimming pool, but we’re not much for pools anyway. We would come again, in fact"
…
"Genuine and rustic. Debora and Gerardo made our stay wonderful. Good location right off the main street, close to the local bookstore, an ATM and the supermercado. Kudos to the house cat that is asleep all the time. Very quiet here. No street noise and no dust in the Inn. A pot of coffee is on early in the morning."
…
"I discovered La Damiana after staying in another larger, more pretentious, and MUCH more expensive hotel in Loreto.  La Damiana is perfect and is now my new go-to place in town.  Debora and Gerardo and genuinely warm and enthusiastically welcoming.  The inn is in the perfect location, just a block from the central plaza and the mission.  The building is charming, spacious, and homey.  I had the two room suite upstairs, which was a real treat."
"Owners Steve and his wife Fammy and housekeepers were all very professional and friendly.    I stayed two nights, prior to going on a mule pack trip and returned after to meet up with left luggage, Steve nicely stored.   The room is comfortable, the shower was great! The bed and linens fine.  The location is ideal for walking to the Malecon, the town square and Loreto Mission.  Many good restaurants an easy walk away. I will return to Loreto and will book first at Iguana Inn."
"We stayed only one night, though we wished we could stay longer. The inn itself is beautifully done, converted from an old house. I loved the communal kitchen area and the garden. Debora and Gerardo were both very welcoming and friendly, giving us good suggestions for dog-friendly options for the evening. We could easily walk to the plaza and along the malecón. Highly recommend this hotel!"
"Loved this spot, cute, quaint and close to everything. Super convenient to the marina, water, stores, and restaurants. We were in the suite that had a kitchenette. Only thing we should have communicated is that we were leaving early to go fishing and they locked the gate and we had to do hope the fence and there is no TV in the room. "
La Damiana Inn was awesome.  The accommodations were excellent and It was like a retreat place.  Debra and Itzel were marvelous hosts and so accommodating.  I highly recommend this Inn to travelers.  It is centrally located to the plaza and many wonderful restaurants. I know I will be coming back soon.
"Beautiful ambiance, friendly and helpful staff, and comfortable environment. We came in June which turns out to be the beginning of the hot season and we were so thankful for the air conditioning. The community style kitchen was great and had ample supplies. Gerardo, Itzel, and Deborah were very welcoming and helpful and made everything run smoothly. Thank you!"
"When a favorite place changes hands you always worry about going back.  This time there was no worry. The place looks wonderful and to top it off Fanny Y Steve are a delight, always there to be helpful. Now a “more” favorite spot to enjoy over and over."
"This Inn is truly authentic Mexico! My room had comfortable bed, a private bathroom with shower, A/C, and a ceiling fan. There was a community kitchen which was the heart of the Inn. Geraldo, the owner, welcomed guests and with his gentle manner, pulled people together. He even ""waited up"" for me to return from an evening excursion!! I traveled solo but NEVER felt alone - the town is safe, super-friendly, and walkable! The Inn is nestled in the center of town, it allowed easy access to restaurants, car rent"
"One of the (US) owners on our arrival was very rude to our (there were 4 of us) Mexican guide and to my (non-white) partner, asking him whether he was staying there. I imagine that, as my partner was non-white, he assumed that he was just a helper for our group. One has the impression he prefers guests to be of a particular profile, ethnic or otherwise. The same person also decided unilaterally to change our departure time from the B&B the next day (without reference to the four of us and our driver), perha"
" any housekeeping at all on a Sunday (blamed on the Mexican staff who doesn’t work on Sundays), and having peremptory housekeeping on a Saturday (to a lesser degree than the other rooms (I know because I asked the other guests about the standard of their housekeeping on that day)), and the lavatory roll and toiletries not being replaced, then this is the B&B for you. The rooms were comfortable, when they were made up (effectively on 1 day out of 4). This B&B is not close to the old centre, so unless you hav"

"Wow, what more can we say?  Six plus stars!! Don't let the street presence fool you!  A true oasis waits you beyond the gate.  Beautiful, quiet, tranquil.  We were truly welcomed in, arrived as guests and left as good friends of the proprietors Dave and Patrick. The bedroom suites are magnificent, most overlook the pool and the bathrooms have all the amenities as well as an overhead rain shower which opens to a private jungle of vines added to the atmosphere of a tropical paradise.

An amazing  place; great welcome and delicious  breakfast.. Had an excellent  trip to Chichen Itza organized by Dave. The rooms are very well designed. Nice pool and steam room. You just feel at home and welcomed. Nice location  and near from the city center. Highly recommended  
"Dave & Patrick have a beautiful little oasis in the middle of Merida.  They did a fantastic job of making us feel like part of the family from the minute we walked in the door. Cocktail hour by the pool and entertainment from the crew of friendly great little dogs all looking for a pet or scratch.   Breakfast was amazing with fresh fruit, granola, yogurt, homemade English muffins (thanks Patrick) and fresh coffee and juice.   All advice on where to visit in the city or restaurants to eat were all great reco"
"We had the best time at Ochenta Y Dos. The room was beautiful, the pool was glorious, and the food was beyond  our expectations. Dave and Patrick went out of their way to make sure we were having a good time, even organizing massages and Covid tests for the trip home. We did 4 different tours with Dave which were interesting and educational. Would 100% recommend a stay here!!"
"This was our second time staying here and it did not disappoint!  Fabulous b & b, beautifully appointed, wonderful atmosphere and the best hosts you could hope for!  Dave and Patrick are simply superb at what they do.  The 5 M’s (resident puppies) provide endless entertainment.  Food and drinks spectacular as always.  This is my happy place and I highly recommend it!"
We stayed at Boutique By The Museo [ my wife and two children ] last week and we absolutely loved it. The staff were brilliant and helped us with every question we had. The building has been recently fully restored to its full colonial opulence and the quality of the restoration is absolutely fantastic. The attention to detail in every aspect of this hotel reveals a passion for excellence. The rooms were beautiful and the beds were extremely comfortable.  There's a lovely pool in the courtyard.

"This was the most magical and amazing stay in Merida! My entire family and I stayed here to celebrate my wedding. The hotel owner and hotel staff thought of everything. The service was unmatched. Each morning they served an incredible breakfast, often left thoughtful notes or gifts for us in our room, and helped with anything we needed. All the staff speak English and Spanish. The rooms were beautiful and immaculately clean. The location couldn’t have been more perfect. Everything was walking distance and w"

"Our family stayed at this wonderful boutique hotel for our granddaughter’s wedding. Everyone from Sunita Martin, the general manager, to each and every one of the staff were so warm and welcoming. We never entered the common area or sat down that we were approached by someone asking what they could do for us or if we wanted food and beverages.  The facility is beautiful and comfortable and we highly recommend it. It is also within walking distance from museums, restaurants and shopping."
"We experienced the utmost pleasure in staying at Boutique byTheMuseo hotel in March 2022; this place is truly a jewel and operates under the highest of standards. Rooms are well appointed with attention to detail throughout. The Staff are invariably helpful and highly personable; seemingly nothing is too much trouble.  High standards of cleanliness protocols were in place & adhered to, particularly appreciated with Covid-19 still lurking out there in the world. Management also operates a café next door – Pa"

"My wife and I (and our 1 year old daughter) were lucky enough to spend the past 4 weeks in Mexico. It would have been a shorter stay had we not found – and fell in love with – the Merida Santiago Hotel. From the room we had to the staff that ran the hotel to the chefs in the kitchen to the cleaning staff to the owners to the swimming pool. It was just incredible all around!  Owned by the friendly and hospital Jan and Rita, (and close to the heart of the city) the Merida Santiago Hotel literally became our h"

"A group of friends were here for a wedding and we select the Boutique by the Museo for their stay. The place is wonderful. But the personal service is outstanding.They are planning to repeat the great experience. My guests were so happy. Thanks to the owner, she is so kind that makes you feel at home.For me is the best place for receiving my family and friends.Thank you and continue with this kind of good service.PD. The coffe shop is incredible too. Best croissants in town. Love them"
" incredible – and helped with everything we needed (checking us in, waiting our tables, even some babysitting!) Mario has an infectious energy and made everyone around him smile.  And the restaurant showcased a fantastic menu (limited, simple and “comfort food”, but delicious nonetheless). The fish and cauliflower tacos were the best! Lead by head chef Ma-Jo, the kitchen staff made food that was delicious and consistent. (Ma-Jo even went out of her way to create her version of a key-lime pie for our wedding"
"Cascadas is a wonderful place to stay in Mérida.  Its location is within easy walking distance to Centro and many restaurants.  Whilst walking to Centro you really get a sense of ""old Mérida"". Our Hosts, Ellyn and Chucho provided an amazing amount of information; historical, cultural and current. We learned a massive amount from them during our 10 day stay.  The house itself is charming and restful.  The breakfasts were outstanding.  I strongly recommend a stay here."
"We ran around the Yucatan for two weeks, but the last week at Los Arcos was the cherry on top of a great trip. As always, David was the perfect host. The eclectic character of his establishment and his overwhelming generosity made our stay very relaxing and left us with a feeling of being home again. There is no place like Los Arcos and no host that cares more about his guests than David. Don't miss stopping by, specially now when things are opening up!"
"The location is terrific, the staff was extremely capable and polite, they booked our tours and found us the best guides. Our guided tour at the Uxmal Myan World Heritage site was a fascinating history course, plus he took us to a cenote where we were all alone-no crowds. The owner had some great recommendations of food, and seemed to know everyone: we got the meet one of the Netflix stars from ""Taco Chronicles"". There is a great cafe next to the hotel: Pan & Kof.fee, they had a long line on Sunday morning,"
"I literally stumbled upon this gem while exploring Merida (was in Yucatan for 6 weeks) and Jaime kindly ushered me in and to my utter delight, found an oasis of beauty, calm and utter chic. Having a very early flight back, I immediately booked it and it was STUPENDOUS! I wish I had been able to stay longer but that will be for the next time.  The attention to detail and design is sublime and tasteful and I wish I could live there all the time... It transports you back to a time where life was more simple an"

"We had breakfast here in early March 2022. It was fantastic; the little Dutch pancakes with strawberry sauce were perfectly light and sweet. The chilaquiles were incredible. Service is fast, professional, and super friendly! The small dining area is poolside and spotlessly clean. Highly recommended as a charming and delicious breakfast spot."
"This is  a 4 bedroom bed and breakfast with kingsized beds.  Very pleasant, well kept and perfectly clean.  Some places have breakfast...this place has a breakfast that is unmatched.  The kind of breakfast that makes you want to linger and talk.   The place has a nice clean pool and poolside tables that invite you to read or converse with guests in the evening.  Another plus is that within a couple blocks of Cascadas is a small plaza with inexpensive outdoor restaurants to enjoy in the evening.  Local kids "
"Hospitality reigns in this Merida treasure!  Owners Ellyne and Chucho offer the perfect mix for guests with a warm welcome, local food and knowledge of the area.  Every morning we were welcomed by fresh coffee and great breakfasts that included hot local dishes, fresh fruit, breads, and more.  The rooms are spacious and attractively decorated and the views into the inner courtyard with its stonework, greenery and blue pool was a welcome sight during the hot days of February.  Each of the four casitas offers"
"We were the last guests to stay with wonderful David prior to shut down of tourist venues etc. in Merida for COVID-19.  I can not state in words what David's warmth and caring meant to us, particularly in this time of uncertainty.  We had to cut our visit short to fly back to US.  David did everything he could by calling friends in the travel industry to get us the latest travel information.  He literally served as our mom with his caring and concern.  His personally-curated home is absolutely gorgeous and "

" historic center, all of the sites, etc.  Communication with David before we arrived was fabulous.  Because we'd been traveling all over Mexico on planes, crowds and buses, David was at risk to himself and his housekeeper having us there.  But you would never know it for his level of hospitality and personal concern were beyond amazing.  We can't wait to continue our visit with David in Merida as soon as possible.  I hope that David's hospitality is never tested again in this way and that he will enjoy a pl"
Outstanding experience. George and Sarah the proprietors couldn’t have been more gracious. Delicious breakfast every day. Great location.  And Aaron the manager arranged amazing trips and guides to xenotransplantation and Chichen Itza.
"Brand-new boutique hotel.   They have wonderfully restored a colonial building preserving its character while also introducing new architectural concepts, like the bar and restaurant area opening on a modernly-designed swimming pool. Check the cocktail menu.   Very quiet and discreet but still very central, excellent quality of sleep."
I stayed in the Superior Suite for a week when visiting in January 2022. Everything about the stay was fantastic! The room was large and clean (same with bathroom). The meals were fantastic and incorporated Yucatan cuisine. The property is delightful and COVID protocol were strictly followed. My favorite were the staff -- they went over and above to make sure I had a wonderful first time in Merida. I wish I could have stayed longer!
"Staying here was like staying with family. Ellyn is one of the best hosts with whom we have  stayed in our many travels.  The place is comfortable and offers multiple extra features like a fruit drink offered in the afternoon and a couple of glasses of wine available free every day when you want it. Breakfasts are ample and delicious with local fresh fruits and a cooked dish. Our host set up tours for us, offered local advice, and even arranged an inexpensive car rental to drive to the ruins.

"Just spent a week at Casa Del Maya and had a wonderful stay. The location is perfect (situated between the two best areas of the city, Paseo de Montejo and the Plaza Grande) and the staff very helpful. We needed a driver, a taxi, dinner reservations, Covid tests, etc., and Aaron was helpful well beyond the call duty. Our room was simple but more than adequate and the breakfasts were delicious. All around a great experience!"
"Villa Verde is a perfect bed and breakfast if you want to avoid the crowds and if you are looking for a personal and private atmosphere. I would definitely recommend the place - in particular to couples. A few details haven't been perfect though and I wonder if the hosts have lost a little bit of their enthusiasm over the years? A few details in the room, the showers, the safe, TV didn't work (we didn't need it), the very limited breakfast (no buffet, no question like: do you need anything elso, second serv"

" delicious and plentiful!   We really enjoyed our stay and it was wonderful to meet both Ellyne and her husband, they are great people! I can't recommend this place enough. If in Merida again in the future, I'll definitely be looking to stay here again."
"Our family generally stays at chain hotels, and we were hesitant to book at this small boutique because of that -- however, we were swayed by the reviews. To say we were happy with that decision would be an understatement.   From the time we booked, Sara was extremely helpful and communicative. We had many requests and asked her to help us arrange restaurant reservations, tours, COVID tests to return to the US, etc. She did so with ease and always kept us in the loop.   Service at the Diplomat was absolutel"

We have had many, many tour guides in countries around the world, and Raul was perhaps the best that we have ever met. I STRONGLY recommend booking a tour with him through Sara. We left early in the morning for Chichen, and had a lovely to-go breakfast to take with us.   We spent the rest of the weekend lounging around the hotel and walking around Merida. S"

The owner is very attentive. The room we stayed in was very spacious and very comfortable. Location is excellent. If you are looking to stay in Merida for a few days, this place is perfect. I will recommend this place to friends."
"Centrally located, a quiet and luxurious oasis walking distance to all the major sites of downtown Merida. The hosts have lovingly restored the casa to it's colonial grandness and added a swimming pool and relaxing garden. True home made breakfast is  served each morning and the ""staff"" Felipe is sweet beyond compare.  Always helpful and offering suggestions your hosts truly make you feel like you are with family."

My favorite was “La Palapa”, where I took a “siesta” every day during our three days there (and I’m never able to take a siesta at home!). The rooms were booked, but we could say we had the house just for ourselves. The rooms are big, nicely decorated, and the shower is fantastic.  There are mosquito repellent, sunscreen and sunburn cream for the guest to use free of char"
"Villa Verde is a very special place to stay in lovely Merida.  Location is excellent - loved being close to Santa Lucia, great restaurants and shops.  The owner/host Robert was beyond helpful.  He provided so many suggestions, maps, destinations which were perfect for our first time visit. Breakfasts were different and delicious each of our 6 mornings.  The room could have used a bit of freshening but I will still give it 5 points for the quality of hospitality."
"The Diplomat was our first stop on a special birthday trip.  The rooms are comfortable, large, and beautifully appointed (we were in the Paramount); the grounds green; the pool tranquil; the breakfast delicious.  The staff are lovely and the owners are charming and kind.  Given the beautiful photos on their site, and their consistently high TripAdvisor reviews, we had high expectations, which were all exceeded."
"What a pleasure to have spent the last two weeks of January with David Reed at Los Arcos. Our expectations were high, given the steady stream of consistently stellar Trip Advisor reviews. But they were exceeded in every respect. Located in Centro, Los Arcos is steps from three excellent restaurants and the English library and an easy walk to the attractions of Plaza Santa Lucia, Plaza Grande and Paseo de Montejo. The street entrance to Los Arcos does not prepare one for what lies within. David’s home is a s"

"The Diplomat Hotel has a perfect location, outstanding local breakfast, lovely pool and beautiful rooms.  But what will bring us back to the hotel is the incredibly warm and inviting hospitality provided by Sarah and the Diplomat team.

Walking around in the heat it was so wonderful to return to the cool tranquility of Casa del Maya. We had 2 double beds in our room which was bliss! Breakfast different every day and the owner Sonny was always on hand for help and advice as was Aaron.
"Located in the developing outskirts (industrial zone) of Merida, the inn has one advantage: it is walking distance to a supermarket and the anthropological museum. Looking for culture? You may be out of luck - 30 min drive to the vibrant center with all its bars and music. But the reason for giving 1 star was serious miscommunication with the 'management', or complete lack thereof. I was there for a planned stay of five days, three covered by the local research institute and the inn had my credit card on fi"

"This was only my second trip to Mexico, and I do not speak Spanish well at all - so it was my luck and good fortune to have booked our stay at Casa Del Maya! This wonderful B & B is a rare gem that exists in the old historic district of the city; walking distance from a slew of great restaurants, bars, and shops, as well as the grand Paseo Montejo area. The staff is professional, warm and you want to bring them all home with you. Aaron is especially wonderful and sees to any needs you have, schedules tours,"
 for hosts: take care of your guests and treat them with respect. Catastrophic!
 but would be convenient to have. No safety box. But realy you do not need it. TV faces to the wall not to beds in the room but there we do not require it at all. Breakfast  starts  from 8:30 but if you need it earlier for your trips you get a package with breakfast items.
 all unfold beyond the stucco entrance to the magic of Casa Del Maya. Thank you Sonny and Aaron!

Outstanding! Wonderful! Comfortable! Delicious! Excellent! Will return! What more can be said?!? Our family of four thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Diplomat Boutique Hotel in charming Merida.  Sara and Neil and Carla and Paola and Renata are so welcoming and helpful.  Been thinking about our visit ever since we left!
This is a modern high rise hotel in the northern part of Merida.  It is quiet and has all the amenities of a we;ll established hotel.  I made a mistake of not booking enough nights and the staff was extremely polite and accommodating for my mistake.The floor numbering is a little odd.  You enter the hotel on Floor 0.  You then take the elevator up one floor to the lobby - Floor L.  The next floor up is Floor 1.
Sara and Neil are the absolute best!  They are so accommodating and make you feel like family the second you walk in.  I have Celiac disease and they went out of their way to make sure there were gluten-free options.  They want you to the have an amazing time in Merida so they spend time walking you through the places to see and shops to go to.  They have relationships with all the best restaurants and attractions and were able to get us reservations.  Still our best meals in Merida were the breakfasts at T
"The hotel is located at the commercial area of Merida.  Nearby there is a mall and supermarket, so the location is very good and convenient for travelers.  Although is far from the old center of the city.  The entrance is a bit strange, as you do not enter the hotel immediately, but you enter to a small informal lobby and then on the third floor you do your check in.   The rooms are fine although they could have a little more details.   The service is good, focused on executives.  Nice stay."
"Quite the new trendy spot. Little pricey. However, it is built for trendy, middle class to rich folks, either visiting or living in Mexico. Clean with new TV, lots of plug ins. Valet service was with the booking. Plenty of good options for food and drinks in the lobby area. "
"Stayed here for a week for a business trip. The accommodation, facilities and service were absolutely excellent. I had no complaints at all. The only thing I had an issue with was the fact that not too many of the staff spoke English which was a challenge at times but we were in Mexico after all so I won’t count that against the hotel or staff too much. For the price, amenities and service, Fiesta Inn ticks all the boxes. I will definitely recommend it and I would definitely return if I’m ever in Merida aga"
"Great price,  the hotel it is located outside of the city center, not close to the attractions, would need to use Uber or have a car. The hotel was clean and had a fridge and is across the street from Costco and shopping center. There was a museum across the street. Front desk was kind enough to located a laundry mat that was 3 minutes away."
"I stayed with family at this hotel in July '17. It's very basic, no proper restaurant but new and with walking distance to shopping centres. We had breakfast and dinner in the many restaurants at the shoppIng centres.  This hotel is in a very convenient place to travel to Progreso beach, Chichén-Itza and different ""cenotes"".  It doesn't have many rooms and is a small hotel, rooms have cooking facilities, mini fridge and a sink. There's a small pool at the hotel but we didn't use it. Good place to stay if yo"
"Stayed here for one night. Place was filthy. I left and requesred a credit. After my airbnb review period was up, he left a review on me recommended not to rent to me. The sheets were filthy. Mattress was filthy and when I complained I was told that americans come over here expecting standards like the states. Not but I don't expect filthy. "
"If you check my reviews you will see that I call it as I experience it.  Do not use this hotel or Orbitz to book it!!!!   We are going to have to work with Visa to help us get something done.  After we checked in and stayed BECAUSE ALMOST ALL HOTELS WERE BOOKED, we tried to check out before noon.  We couldn't because their ""system had us staying longer and they couldn't change the computer"". We left with a lot of arguing and trying to call Orbitz -as of yet No help! Please learn from our terrible experience"
"Location is a bit remote but worth the trip. Beautiful well manicured in the accommodations are totally well maintained. I think I have never seen such perfect maintenance on any accommodation in Mexico Staff is also excellent and very accommodating.I don't often mention names of the employees but in this case I will. Mary Jose, from the front office, went above and beyond for any request. Even put number on my Cellular in case I needed anything. So it's very helpful. I highly recommend this place. "
"This is the worst hotel I have stayed in Merida, filthy everywhere, mildew in the showers, don´t be  fooled by the location this is far from downtown. At 4 am someone was working, hammering somewhere in the hotel. Stay way from this place, Merida has much more to offer. We booked for two nights and had to look for another hotel as were not going to stay another night although they took our money."
Merida was full so we stayed here and liked it. It is quite new so it is very clean- hopefully they manage to maintain it that way. Taxi to center is approx 100 pesos and museum us across the street. Don't expect too much from the poll restaurant which is a pity as it is pleasant setting in natural shade-they should definitely upgrade this. The only annoying thing which i normally hate and find to be gross is that drain in the shower did not work. This is why cleaning lady cannot clean it fully and otherwis
"When I was looking for a hotel in Merida for a three days/four nights stay I was looking for a place very close to the Plaza de la Independencia to have my morning walks and breakfast in the centre, then walk the city, get back to the hotel, relax a little and get out again for further exploring and dinner. I had three places in my short list and finally decided for this place. One, a very import point for my decision, was the very close proximity to the centre. As shown on Google maps it was supposed to be"
 but there will be no hotel. And he was right. We then went off to the right direction -  a 30 minute drive in taxi outside the city!   When getting to the hotel I was very angry and told the guys at the reception that they have a wrong direction on their page and that Google shows the hotel at one block away from plaza majority right in the middle of the centre of Merida. Instead they are so far away. They told me they had these complains before -  then I wonder why didn't they change it asap!?  I find it 
Beds were comfortable and room a good size. We thought it wouldn’t be too bad staying out of town but you can’t rely on ubers - the front desk can order taxis to be booked for a certain time and this was most reliable Option -  it was also sometimes hard to get a taxi back from town. The breakfast is not great a tasteless and cold they have about 5 hot options but don’t book here for the breakfast.
We stayed here the night before our flight back to the states.  They set up our required travel Covid test and a doctor came to the hotel and completed the test. The staff spoke excellent English.  Highly recommended 
The hotel is located less than 10 minutes away from downtown Merida. There was easy access to any type of transportation. The room was very clean and the beds are comfortable. Definitely will stay again at this hotel when visiting Merida.
"Location of this hotel is ideal as it’s not in the busy center of town. It’s next to a mall and museum. Staff were friendly, attentive, & professional. Breakfast was delicious & the room was clean. We felt very safe in the hotel & there was always police presence in the area. Not a 5 because bed was too firm for me and there is always room for improvement!"
"Excellent customer service. Friendly personnel. Great location. Close to nice restaurants and shopping centers, and only a few minutes away from historical downtown area. We even had a chance to check the cenote in the Costco around the corner"
I was quarantined in the hotel for about 14 days.The hotel did their best by providing us with timely and healthy food for all the three meal times.The rooms very super clean and I thank the HK staff for keeping the room as per the Hitlon standard. I would like the hotel to continue their efforts to make the hotel a shining star in the location.
"I stayed at this Hilton for 5 nights in March 2021. I was greeted warmly after I went through Covid protocols of tempature check and sanitizing everything.  The room was large and clean.  Jacobo,  one of the men who work at the desk helping guests , gave me great ideas of places to visit.  The breakfast each morning was hot and delicious. During covid I did not expect this to be provided and was pleasantly surprised at the great food!. When I was having difficulty ordering take out Erick in reception came t"
"Near the convention center and the Grand Museum of the Maya.  This brand is identical to properties in the US.  WiFi speed was good.  The Hampton is in a fast growing part of Merida near a Costco, Chedraui, and Liverpool."
"Hotel is very beautiful and very clean. Breakfast was very plentiful. Atmosphere was pleasant. Transportation to the airport does not exist. Front desk says they need a license first.  Power in the rooms and elevators are controlled by your key card. There is no pool! My room had large shower, no bathtub, nor microwave. Saw one in the lobby. Small bar next to front desk opens @noon.  Nice for overnight."
"On 3rd party sites, they state coin laundry, as an amenity.   My main purpose of booking hotel was because it stated coin laundry, and I wanted to wash my clothing the way I am used to. Before check out the next morning, I went to front desk and inquired about where was laundry room. I was told by clerk that it was not available that day. I advised her that my only purpose of staying at the hotel was because of the coin laundry they advertised. She got on her computer and stated she would find me one. I adv"
"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel.Only complaints was the breakfast and the way customers behaved...sneezing,blowing their noses around the food. People need to be more considerate. Good coffee.The music in the lobby was too loud and annoying. "
" laundry done and back by 5pm. I advised her that that’s way past check out. She continued on phone. After hanging up, She handed me a ‘laundry form’ and asked me to fill it out and give her clothes within 15 minutes. I decided to just give her ‘a few items’, and returned her the form and clothing. At 12 noon check out time, I advised her I was sitting in lobby. She acknowledged. Around 1 pm, a housekeeper came and gave her a bag, and she advised me my clothes was ready.

We were just told that we will receive one little bottle of purified water PER ROOM, not even per guest.  This is inexcusable. Even the worst of the worst hotels in Mexico provide purified water free of charge to their guests.

This Hotel is one of the best hotels I’ve stayed in while visiting the Yucatán ! I want to give much thanks to Martin who works the front desk!!  and all who work the security at night and the door men during the day! !!!  The women who work breakfast are amazing and so sweet and helpful !  I’m just so impressed with this  hotel I could go on and on!!!  I go to Merida often and have stayed at so many different hotels !  This wins the Gold Medal.  Thank you Residence inn The room was so comfortable and I lov
"This was my first stay at this property, and I will make this my go-to hotel in Merida! I was there for 16 days...  It is basic in its appearance, but I assure you that the rooms are great! The staff are equally great! And even though this hotel is situated along a main street, I never heard a sound in my room. It was truly one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in.  But more than all of that - this being a Holiday Inn Express, you may be reluctant because of the quality of the  ""free"" breakfast. NOT T"
"Excellent stay! Staff was great- it was a busy time and the breakfast staff was overwhelmed but they were extremely kind and went above and beyond, especially when people were being inpatient. The room was very clean and spacious. We would definitely come back!"
" hours a day.  The hotel is ideally located within a short walking distance of the Zocolo - the main plaza in Merida. Along the walk are two colonial churches, numerous shops, a park, the Cathedral, and the Govorner's Palace, as well as numerous restaurants.  Also, if you rent a car, there is free parking in a public lot. The only caveat is that it is 1 1/2 blocks away. But the hotel staff is always available to retrieve the car for you.  The rooms are high tech in the way they are set up with the key. The "

"Very nice property to stay  short or long . The hotel is very new, clean , functional ,huge and comfortable room with a very good air-conditioning. The breakfast is good, not too variety but is ok. The location is very good 300 mts to  Galeria plaza and Costco and Chedraui nearly. The service is very good in every area, front desk, breakfast , lobby, housekeeping, transportation, all staff were very right  and polite. I would like to metion front desk Ramon and others."
"I used to be a frequent client of the hotel. During my last stay  I made a mistake when booking the reservation through Expedia as I made it for 6 nights instead of 5 nights. The reservation was placed one day before my arrival since this hotel always has availability due to great competition of other nice brands near it like Hamptons, Fiesta, Ibis etc. Anyway, I stuck to it as customary. Upon check-in I informed the receptionist my mistake and desire to modify my reservation for 1 day less. I was informed "
"Beautiful new hotel, great rooms, large & modern, nice kitchens (missing blenders), rooftop pool & gym (large, but hotel is way behind on Covid practices & still requires a reservation), great location, next to 2 new shopping centers.  Duty & Food & Beverage Manager is outstanding, breakfast quality is excellent, great price (although not always available).  Why ""1 Stars"":  Check-in was horribly slow, obnoxiously harassed after taking my mask off (briefly at least 6 feet away from reception staff), DESPITE "
" not bleach....grey color. 2- Breakfast is overpriced, lacks variety and the juices tasted horrible, not fresh fruits...packed juiced. 3- Amenities in the bathroom are upon demand, it caused stress because you need to plan what are you going to use before taking a shower for asking in advance. They don't replace. 4- Some rooms are noisy especially the one next to the elevator and the maid rooms. 5- Poor assistance-oriented hotel, for instance, the don´t have power plug-in adaptors  for European guests."

I got robbed for my prescription sunglasses while i was away from my room. I went to the front desk to complain and continued with my day. When i returned to my room later that night my glasses magically appeared on my bed. Never again will i stay here .

The hotel and services are a Holiday Inn Express average.  This hotel has a small but nice swimming pool.  The difference was made by the graciousness and kindness of the Staff.  Poor breakfast. Average parking place and fitness room
…
"This hotel is the worst hotel, room wasn’t clean at time of arrival, bathroom smelled like public toilet; bathroom and shower extremely small also the room even the suite was extremely small. Employees was rude poor customer service…. In top of everything that hotel doesn’t have anything NOT POOL, NOT LAUNDRY, NOTHING… "
"We stayed with our 3 dogs - and yes, the room is a little small but the room is clean, modern and has everything you might need. Location is fabulous - and is part of Galerias Mall. But truly, the staff and their upbeat personalities really make this hotel experience great! Fun, helpful and willing to do what they can to make your experience in the hotel perfect. The breakfast was so-so.  For the dog people, lots of grass in the parking lot to walk your dogs right outside the front door."
"This should be an excellent stay, except that I had to deal with the customer service representative twice because of not reporting the correct points. In addition, they are not reporting their company as Marriott on the credit card; instead, it's a ""corp inmobiliar,"" so instead of getting the right points per stay, you will get nothing. That's the only hassle with staying in this property. But if you're not a loyalist and don't care about points, then this property is excellent."
"We had a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel. We loved the fact that the employees demonstrated great customer service with a pleasant personality. A plus to this hotel is that it is right at the Galerias Plaza, which means you have quick access to lots of fun shopping."
"I thought the room was really small, and the sink layout is strange. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. It's at the Galerias, which has a skating rink - had I been thinking, I would have brought gloves."
"Clean, modern hotel. Great location near Gallerias mall and great pricing per night. Really enjoyed our stay. Staff very friendly. A little set back off road so no road noise. Definitely recommend if looking for a large hotel. "
"I don’t recommend you stay in this hotel , I am sure you can find other option rather in the city with better attitude towards customers .No amenities in bathroom. No safe box in room. Very poor breakfast, cheaper and better options outside."
"I went a week ago and at first sight it take me through the main lobby, it's really incredible this ibis thematic and most wonderful the customer service, the receptionist guy was an incredible person, they can assist you in French, English and Spanish therefore i fall in love of this hotel choise.... the best !!"
"We recently stayed at Ibis Styles, the hotel opened a month ago. It has a modern vibe, it’s clean and the staff is friendly. The location is nice since it is inside the Galerías mall and near the Mayan Museum. The room is supposed to be a family room but it is not correct, it has a queen bed and a double sofa, not a sofa bed. The sofa is pretty uncomfortable for two people. For business travelers or for a couple it may be ok but for a family with two tweens it was not the best. The view of the family suites"
"En este mes es la segunda vez que me hospedo eb este maravilloso lugar!! Realmente es limpio, todo es nuevo, tienen un restaurante en la pmanta baja y cafe en la parte del segundo piso con vista a la calle es una terraza muy bonita.  Todos son muy amables y serviciales. Digno de recomendar"
"We booked a day trip to this all inclusive resort from progreso (carnival cruise). We were told that it was “only 15 mins away” which turned out to be more than 30 mins away. The resort was nice, beach was okay. My complaint was the cocktails were very watered down, buffet was nasty, flies in the salsa. I felt like the bartenders were begging for tips, and if the drinks were good, I would of tipped better."
"My husband & I ended up here after taking the free bus from carnival cruise to the town. We didn’t want to pay a whole lot for another excursion so we decided to venture off & came across this place as it was one of the options the bus staff gives you. It was a $45 round trip per person that included the fare with a tour guide, a stop at some historic ruins and afterwards they take you to a resort with a Mexican style buffet, unlimited (alcoholic drinks) as well as a pool and a beach! Very friendly & attent"
My bride and I booked this as an all day inclusive get away.  As soon as we got off of bus we were greeted by such a friendly staff.  The water was so calm and the surroundings were very well kept.  I would like to go back just to visit there next time
"Hotel is very modern, rooms are mid-sized with fast wi-fi connection, parking is available for free. Breakfast was included but offer was miserable. There is also a swimming pool, but we didn't have a time to use it."
Just made our first cruise trip ever and wasn’t sure where this would end up but I think on a note we were 90% happy! After pricing other cruise excursions we were under the impression unless you buy from the cruise ship you can’t find one. We rode the AutoProgresso bus offered by the city from the port to city and city to port. We were approached by a man with Technotel and told that each person to go on a 45 minute round trip excursion would be $40 per person. Being reluctant and luckily fluent in Spanish
 the resort where the food and drinks were “Amazing” and very generous. I would recommend this. We got to walk in and out of a Mayan Ruin and saw the Cenotes also up close. Progreso is no piece of cake but if you want to shop cheap and eat some good food at least be ready for that. 
"We have booked this hotel for New Years eve, Hotel actually has good location and is easy to find it. You have to be driving if staying in this hotel,but downtown is 15 min away driving, so it was no a big issue. Staff was very polite, hotel is actually more modern then I expected. Room was spacious and clean,we got  big king size bed, and it was very comfortable.Our room was facing pool and it was quiet.

"Our second excision on our girls' cruise was to Progreso, Mexico. We decided to visit Technotel resort after learning a few negatives about the public beach. The grounds are nice and clean. There are plenty of chairs and palaces because they only allow one cruise ship per day. Our server was Jose, and, though he did not speak English, he kept cold drinks in our hands. Our fee included unlimited food and drinks plus restroom and shower access, chair and palapa use, and a couple nice pools. Be aware that the "

If anyone found it we would really appreciate it if you could send us the pictures from the phone."
"We stayed here due a event nearby, the place is by the highway towards Progreso, so is 15 minutes drive from Merida Downtown, it is ok, our room was really good, somehow old but clean and all working nice, they do accept pets, so this was a big issue for us, they have some rules for this but really achievables, so we appreciate it, the pool is small but enough for a hot day, breakfast is ok it is small but included, frontdesk guys try to do their best, but they are slow to attend, so take your time for chec"

"This hotel is located just outside of Mérida on the road to Progresso. I would not recommend staying at this hotel if you do not have your own transportation as it is about a 20 min drive to Merida Centro. Service was poor at the front desk, we were charged more than we were quoted when we booked the room. The front desk attendants were not friendly or welcoming when we arrived.   Continental breakfast is included and consisted of coffee, juice, cereal and a small platter of breads.  The breakfast attendant"
"Gonna rent a place here,  super laid back and friendly. First evening, arrived late from Merida.  First guy I talk to works eco tourism as a diver/guide. Drove me in his truck all over looking for a place to stay. Then I have a very late dinner at Palapa Soco ( Great!). Got keys in my pocket,  no idea where my room is! Milo, owner of the palapa drove me all over , until finally found my place. Cool or what!"

"We we thrilled with this gem! It’s beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Tile work is charming. The staff were all helpful, friendly and respectful. There is a pool and also a rooftop area for outdoor leisure. The location could not be better. We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Sisal! !"
"El hotel luce nuevo pero hasta aquí llega lo positivo. Las habitaciones muy chicas, muy obscuras, sin servicios básicos cómo caja fuerte, bote de basura en la recámara. No había agua caliente y no pudieron solucionar la falla y la alberca verde por falta de mantenimiento. Personal poco profesional y noche sin poder dormir por el ruido de una fiesta en la calle. 1,800 pesos por una noche sin desayuno es demasiado"
"El hotel es tipo apart, tiene heladera, microondas, cafetera, pileta y algunos utensillos de cocina. Es amplio, tiene una mesa con silla y 2 camas, el baño el grande y tiene aparte un antebaño. Es tranquilo, a pasos de la playa y tiene terraza con vista hermosa. Es familiar, y el personal es muy muy amable. A cuadras de la zona principal."
Hacienda Xcanatun is undoubtedly one of the best dining experiences in the area. Tonight they surpassed my expectations by putting on a beautiful Thai evening. The incredibly beautiful setting was specially decorate in Asian theme and twinkle lights among the Royal Palms.   The concept was Thai street food and there were individual stations cooking food in front of us .. reminiscent of eating from a street cart in Bangkok but so much prettier.  I only wish I had captured that for this post.    The food was

"This was so disappointing. Do not be fooled by the photographs. Our room was huge and had a small pool. We did not use the pool at all because the water looked dirty. It was still, appeared to have a greasy film on top, and was a most inviting place for mosquitos. The room was painted in dull, grey colours that merged into one another, it was poorly ventilated and lit, and at times the bathroom smelled musty. Surfaces were dusty, and the towels were thin and grey but once upon a time would have been white. "

The hotel is located in front of the beach on the malecon.  Our bedroom was on the first floor with blinds that allow people from the street to see inside the room by day from close and to see even more from far by night.

We stayed at Playa Linda for a week in January. It was right on the main street. It was very nice and accommodating. The staff was outstanding! It would be hard to find a better place at the affordable prices they had there.
"We booked a ""suite"" with a kitchenette.    What is a typical ""kitchenette"" throughout North America?    In my books it is a kitchen facility that includes coffee maker, toaster, pots and pans, silverware, glasses, and dishes.    None of this is provided at Playa Linda.   There was no blanket provided for the bed.  The TV has no english channels, and the front desk only speaks spanish. There is no elevator.  If you are on the fourth floor be prepared to walk up four flights.  There is no person to assist you"
"Nice hotel, good price but not so big rooms, there was no window in the room looking on the street only the inside of the hotel. Room was very basic, bed was good. Shower ok, but water presure not so good. The shower door did not close well which was a bit anoying. The staff was friendly and we were lucky we could park in front of the entrance.

"Your hotel is great, it's as simple as that. It immediately felt like home and it was nice and quiet (which is nice after a few hostels which weren't as quiet as your hotel). Your location is good and the staff was nice! Rooms were ok, but not VERY clean. It was good for a few days, thank you!   The only bad thing was that our shower had cold water, very cold water."

All the rooms are centred around the nice courtyard (where breakfast is served) behind the building is a school, we could hear the playground in the mornings but no bother really.

There is no wifi in your room. There is only ONE power outlet and that is in the bathroom. If you order breakfast expect to wait 45min at least. At least the beds are comfortable but that is the absolut only positive thing about it.  Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!!
"This hotel is a beautifully renovated building, but the furniture and service isn’t quite at the same level yet. The pool area is nice, but the bar isn’t functional. We also never received towels for our room, and had to ask for more beach towels for our shower. It’s clean and near the beach and very quiet after the cruise ship guests leave the beach club across the street."

This restaurant has been completely renovated since we first went ten years ago. I notice someone who was there in 2012 did not like but I think they would find it very different now. We have been for both lunch and breakfast several times and everything we have had has been good. They also do a carry out meal for supper which you order in advance. The pool is sparkling clean as is the eating area. They now have a separate children's pool. I can't comment on the accommodation but it looks clean and tidy loo
"Four of us went to Hotel Las Garzas for lunch. The menu looked good, but we had been talking about hamburgers so we decided to go American and had the hamburgers(with a Mexican flair). First came the botanas; a delicious chicken fajita for each. We had made the ""mistake""of ordering chicken nachos(very good); mistake because it was huge. After the fajita and nachos (para llavar because we couldn't finish the nachos) came the hamburger and french fries (more para llavar because we couldn't finish that either)"
"we stayed for  2 nights in august 2012, this hotel sucks,  price is cheap, but so are  the rooms, the lights went out everyday, the fan, the lamps and even the door was falling at pieces, dark rooms, stinky bathroom, and old beds and mattresses, avoid !!"

The owners are exceptionally friendly and hospitable and they make sure to put all of the perfect touches on everything (amazing breakfast, nice mattresses, great water pressure, very clean rooms,  etc.), which is very hard to find in hotels in the area. We will definitely be back!"
"We stayed here for the 1 night we stayed in Chelem. I think as there are not too many hotels in Chelem, this would probably be a good choice. It was pleasant as it has a nice, clean pool, chairs to sunbathe, a pool table and even tennis courts. There were a couple things that were off-putting, like the toilet did not flush properly. Also, when we decided to not stay a 2nd night (we had reserved two nights and then changed our plans), the person at the front desk made a fuss over it. It was definitely unders"
 to leave the hotel they can entertain themselves there too.
This was our third February in a row at the Flamingos Inn. Mike continues to make improvements. The beach is much better...more sand has been deposited. Breakfasts were awesome. We stayed in the Arena Room on the second floor. It’s our favorite room.
…
"I really enjoyed this boutique hotel. It only had 12 rooms, so it is very quiet and romantic. Room size was more than I expected. The pool, restaurant, and cabanas have the BEST view from the BEST part of the island. They had private areas for guests only which made it awesome to be comfortable relaxing when taking in the scenery.    Only downsides I had was that the lighting was way too dim ... and no ventilation in the bathroom.   However, I would definitely recommend staying there again if you want a rom"
"We love it here! There is so much to do in the area, but relaxing at the inn is just as nice. The oceanfront rooms are beautiful and include a kitchen, hammock and spacious deck. Love the beach walks there. It was a bit windy for ocean swimming this time, but the pool was lovely. Mike is a gracious host and is very helpful with recommendations. He added solar power to the inn, which we really appreciate. It’s a luxurious stay with a reduced carbon footprint."
From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed like family. Rozie met us at the gate and gave me a big hug. Im like “really”??? I thought I was the only one who hugs strangers. From that moment on we were part of the Flamingos family. We stayed in the Arena room which was in a perfect location for the ocean views and courtyard views. Rozie makes a fantastic breakfast and our favorite was the biscuits and gravy. We actually asked her to size our portions down the second day because we got so full that we didn’t
"Spent 2 nights here in Feb. 2011.  The staff were very friendly and helpful to us, especially Alex and Raul. (We really enjoyed our stay here, but I feel I have to give it only 3 stars, in order to keep expectations realistic for typical American tourists.  This is not the Ritz, it is a beachside place in a small town, so you will see things like old bathroom fixtures, beat-up furniture, etc.  If these things don't matter to you, then you'll enjoy this place.) Our room was large and comfortable, with a big "

"We have visited Isla Mujeres many times over many years and Chichi Charlie’s was always one of our main stops.! We are 60  and like to make a day of our beach hike stopping for drinks and conversation along the way. We start at the tip of North Beach stopping to swim, eat, drink and walk. We always tend to spend the most time at Chi-chi Charlie’s. Great views of the ocean and a fun place to stop. Well at least it used to be. Today when we arrived we picked one of the many open tables where we could people w"
"We had a fantastic stay at Casa Del Jaguar on Playa Norte, Isla Mujeres.  The beach was great, private area for guests only.  Rooms were large and very comfortable.  Convenient walk to everywhere including lots of restaurants.  The front desk recommended restaurants that were fantastic!   Staff were wonderful to work with.  Breakfast at their beach café was always good. Jorge, our bartender took really good care of us."
…
"This is a charming colorful inn.  The rooms are large and attractive.  Most of them overlook the water, with outdoor decks.  This is not a perfect place for the fussy. Water pressure and internet vary in predictability. This is a special, reasonably priced place, lovely location, great breakfast... Rose is a wonderfully warm and accommodating host."
 we would have easily spent 400 pesos we weren’t treated as if we were welcome there. We left. Sorry we won’t stop again.
"Casa Jaguar is a beautiful small hotel located close to North Beach. We enjoyed our stay here, glad we chose this location, as it was close to everything. Not having to worry about transportation was a big deal! We were walking distance from the ferry, few steps from the beach, a block from a great selection of restaurants.  More positives -breakfast included at the Green Zebra beach club next door -never have to fight for a beach chair, they are reserved for the hotel -there was a hammock in our room! with"
"Flamingos Inn is one of the most comfortable friendly hotels I have ever stayed in.  Don't expect the amenities of a big fancy resort, this is so much more.  Flamingos Inn is about friendliness, relaxation and a sense of belonging, from the moment I walked onto the property and met Roze, I felt welcome and the personalized service just made me feel more like I was at home.  My wife arrived a few days after me and she felt the same thing.  We stayed a total of two weeks and do not hesitate to call Roze and M"

" when we just wanted to walk on the beach at night. We had to walk all around the hotel and down the side street.  -there is no gym. There is a yoga studio at Na Balam next door, but it is not owned by them, so you have to pay to attend classes there ($15 was pretty steep). They would not let me borrow a yoga mat to use in my room. This is a bummer for a fancy hotel not to have a gym or any gym equipment. -the pool you are allowed to use is at Na Balam. It is a small sad pool. We wanted to use the jacuzzi ("
"The new owners, Mike and Roze, have made many improvements to what was a great place to begin with. First of all, the parking area has been rock-lined to delineate parking spots. Next, the walkway from the gate has been beautifully paved so luggage can be easily rolled. My wife and I stayed in the Arena room on this visit. It had a new, full-sized fridge so we did not need a separate cooler for ice and drinks like last year. Roze’s breakfasts were outstanding. Finally, Mike and Roze are very friendly and pe"
"Absolutely worst place I have stayed in 8 stays in Isla. You have to ask for everything 3x, such as the coffee pot which listed as included. The manager told me he would bring towels to the room and never did. Ended up with one dirty beach towel to use for two showers. Not enough electric outlets in the room and only one light. Shower was only a trickle. The ""new"" section is in a separate but connected hotel. Far below a 3 star property"
…
"We stayed 3 nights at the Flamingo Inn in December.  Our flight was delayed into Merida and we were a little scared that when we arrived at around 11 pm no one would be available to receive us but luckily Mike stayed up to let us in to our room.  We stayed in la casita room which is a separate garden suite in the court yard by itself.  The room was spacious, with a king size bed, kitchenette, and a closet like a hotel.  The room was very clean and had a fridge, microwave, and stove. There is no TV in this r"
We stayed at ChiChi’s ‘n Charlies for four nights over Easter Weekend. The hotel was perfect for what we needed it for. We needed a homebase on the beach at a reasonable price - we paid $60+/night.  We didn’t spend much time in the room other than to shower at the end of a day on the beach and to sleep. The room was simple and CLEAN. It even had a refrigerator which we weren’t expecting but very thankful for. It was cleaned everyday. While my wife was getting ready I loved having a beer on the balcony right
" too much to do and see! We did however have a few drinks at sunset at the secondary beach bar on their property (there are two beach bars on the property). It was a great time every time we stopped there to have a drink - very friendly bartenders.   Suggestions - The balcony could use a plastic chair or two to relax outside of the room. However, I am sure they would have accommodated this had I asked.  Con’s - The only issue I had was the water pressure in the shower. It was a 2 out of 10. But hey, maybe t"
"This newly renovated hotel on the beach of Playa del Norte is in the perfect location of the island. The rooms are clean, spacious and modern and the staff are really helpful. I've stayed here twice now and will definitely be returning!"

"Several asked last week to let them know what I thought of Chichi's & Charlie's. So here it is. I would only stay here for the location and view,and that's only If you get an ocean front room. The room was spacious, shower was nice, water was warm, toilet flushed nicely etc.. But in my opinion not worth $200 nightly. If you're looking for good internet, good customer service etc... do not stay here. If you watch TV at all while on vacation,  my room had a smart TV but internet did not work at all so wasn't "
"check out my Isla drone videos on youtube, search for     scott in bl  3rd time staying here, many good things, some could use a good update.  Angie as general manager would help immensely, current head seems to be punching a time card.  Its so close to being top notch with the location, staff, food and bars, some attention to day to day issues like consistent hot water, and getting what you were told by emails.

"Nous sommes tombés par hasard sur cet hôtel, cherchant à dormir une nuit sur l'île; ce côté épuré, zen de l'extérieur, nous a attiré l'oeil, l'intérieur nous a séduit, les chambres sont magnifiques, spacieuses très bien équipées, le jardin superbe, très bien entretenu, on se croirait en Asie.

 free water like most hotels. Was told there was room service but was never given information when I asked repeatedly. If you get any discount at all on the price of the room you will have to pay for covid test and room if you happen to be positive. Not free as their Facebook page states. Wasn't told this till I tried to make an appointment for my test. Hope this info helps anyone considering this location. 
"Just needed one night here , to get our Covid tests and hop on the ferry in the morning just a short walk away.Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Check in was quick and courteous. Had a pool view 2nd story room. The friendly front desk staff arranged our Covid test in our room. Very reasonable rates, and perfect location. Room had a mini fridge and great air conditioning. I would stay here again. I think perhaps some of the bad reviews,are possibly from people that got one of the rooms in the old"
We had a great stay at this nice hotel. The rooms are really big. We are a family of 5 and it would have been so much better if the possibility of sleeping 3 in a room excisted. There is a sofa in the rooms that could easily be a bed. Business development!

"After a 2 year hiatus we went last minutes while Omicron was beginning to slow down.  Close to the beach, restaurants close by.  Beach access was lovely - but there is no free beach club access.  There are lots of beach clubs close by though.    Hotel felt a little neglected on arrival, but it was clear they were putting lots of effort into grounds cleanup etc during our second week.  Beds are small, but we managed.  Water pressure and hot water were good.  Loved our balcony.  Desk kindly ensured we had sid"
"I asked for a quiet room, I was given a room right in front of a construction site and the day after I was woken by the sound of drilling. When I complained I was told that it was the owner's fauld because he didn't alert the personnel about the construction start date (?). I was offered A) a stinky room with funghus on the wall that they only use for emergency (?) B) A room right below the constructions works C) full refund and up to me to find another room in an overbooked Island (D smaller room in a diff"
" ignoring my main request, he just kept on saying that this was the owner's fault because he didn't tell the personnel in time about the construction. THIS RUINED OUR HOLIDAYS. I regularly visit Isla Mujeres and this hotel is the worst ever I stayed, even a hostel provides more comfort and service."
So glad we came across this hotel.  Very good location right on the beach ( You can use sun beds there)  Staff were very helpful and rooms immaculately cleaned .  A continental breakfast was taken next door and was a good choice - unlimited coffee/ tea would have been good.  You also have to pay for coffee pods in your room.
"This was our second visit to Maria Del Mar, and our third to Isla Mujeres. Unfortunately since our first visit in 2016 the hotel appears to have gone down hill and so too does the island. Below I will list the positives and negatives we encountered during our stay.  Positives: - The hotel is ideally located with direct access to the Playa Norte beach. - Friendly staff - Offers reliable golf buggy hire at a cheap price - Private pool for hotel guests along with hammocks to relax on during the day and in the "

"We are still here enjoying our 12 day stay at this wonderful hotel! The owners and staff are absolutely wonderful and the place is amazing. This is our second time here and we’re coming back in February. It is a wonderful location, about a 20 minute walk to Centro. Highly recommend."
" toast with a juice and hot drink and no longer have the option to purchase additional items for breakfast such as eggs, bagels or any other cooked breakfast items. This really let the place down as a slice of toast for breakfast isn’t filling for anyone and left us with no other choice but to eat elsewhere. - The WiFi is non existent in the rooms, it only works around the pool. - The room was filthy, possibly one of the filthiest rooms I’ve stayed, the beds were stained, everything was covered in dust and "
"We stayed here 5 nights during our 7 night trip.  Check in was a little rough, they could not find our reservation, which I pulled up on my phone and showed the gentleman.  They had us full out a new reservation sheet and we had a,room in no time.  Our room was clean and spacious, had a balcony over looking the back of the bar.  There was no hot water upon check in, and since we just came from another hotel with no hot water I was slightly concerned.  I inquired about it and they said it was being fixed, an"
This hotel was amazing! We just checked out from our 5 night stay and we did not want to leave. All staff were very helpful. The place was so beautiful. They hung a sign for my daughters birthday in our room for when we arrived. They made her a birthday cake out of towels. The girls at the front desk were nice & helpful. Kevin the waiter made good drinks & was very friendly. We ate breakfast 2 times and it was great I was worried that the room was going to be small but it was not. We had the room with the o

"I understand this is a budget, older property. However, certain things I expect even from budget properties is cleanliness and a at least a little maintenance. This hotel is in a great location and has a distinctive old world charm that could really be made into something special with a little elbow grease.  First of all, cleanliness was an issue. The ceiling in our room was covered in cobwebs that when the ceiling fan was turned on would blow around the room. Stains on the bedding, even a blood stain on th"
" back at check out.  Romy was amazing, he has the bar by the pool and makes wonderful drinks.  He was so much fun.  Tje pool was a little chilly, but clean.  The location is great, easy walk to every thing.  There is free coffee each morning from 5:30 to 7:30 at the front check in area, it is not great but it was hot.  All in all we were very satisfied with our stay."
"Our recent stay met our expectations in most ways.  Bahia Tolok is located within walking distance to the more lively part of the island.  If you opt to take a taxi, it will cost approx 100 mxn pesos.  The staff was helpful to arrange a golf cart rental for us.  Otherwise, the staff provided very little contact other than adequate housekeeping.  Our room was clean, cool and had comfortable beds.  The hot water was minimal and in-room WiFi was very spotty.  Not a deal breaker for us.  The grounds were very w"
" they could do about it.  The pool water was never clear, so opted out of jumping in.  On the bright side, the location is perfect and once again the charm of this place could really be capitalized on with a little work!  We rented a golf cart from the hotel and their rental rates were reasonable.  Also their restaurant, Buho's was a great little beach bar with pretty good, although very basic food."

"Really run down hotel.  Even the ""newer"" buildings, are run down with a tired mattress, hard as a rock.  Tried to get a manager to respond to a air conditioner what worked yet didn't cool the room.  Nope.  Manager was not available by phone or in person.  Pool looked dirty and not what the pictures represent.  Overall a terrible stay.  This place is run down, uncomfortable and some of the worst service I've encountered in Mexico.    Realmente descuidado hotel. Incluso los edificios ""más nuevos"" están deteri"
" was a bit off putting, but it happens.  Definitely is situated in a quiet part of the island."
Upon arrival walking 15 minutes from ferry with luggage on busy walkways at 4pm ($4.00 5 minute taxi ride) at check in a security deposit of $150.00 is mandatory (one surmises that a lot of young party folk book here and do damage?) . Excellent.
"Rooms are basic but OK given the price. Bed, aircon and shower were fine. Location is great, close to things but silent, a unique combination that I didn’t find anywhere else on this island.  Staff is quite uninterested and rude, so if that is a big factor for you I recommend going elsewhere."
" imágenes. En general, una estancia terrible. Este lugar está deteriorado, es incómodo y es uno de los peores servicios que he encontrado en México.  Go elsewhere, there are many more hotels in Isla.  Ignacio the manager/owner doesn't care about his business and his employees show it.  "
…
"We were on the island for 17 days and spent the first 4 nights here. This was a great place to begin as the staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and comfortable and had an outdoor kitchen and large patio with a hammock. There is also a room directly on the pool which I'd like to try as well! The included continental breakfast was surprisingly satisfyingly and all you need to start your day. You can walk to Playa Norte in less than 30 minutes, which we would have done often had it not be"
"I booked this for my son and I.  I chose this hotel based on price and location.  I read the reviews a week before our arrival and was a little concerned.  Checking in was easy and we were shown the property and the room.  And my concerns quickly went away.  The room, bathroom, and balcony were clean.  Daily maid service and a in room Covid test.  We did not eat the breakfast due to dive trips, but toast and coffee I would exactly call breakfast.  We will be back."
We stayed here in February in the Beach House with another couple. You have your own building with a patio and raised terrace for watching the sunrise. The beach house looks remodeled and it was very nice for each bedroom to have their own bathroom. We didn't have any hot water the first day but notified the staff and they promptly fixed it. It was nice to have a kitchen to have a snack or heat up leftovers and with the Super Akai a block away we stocked the fridge with beer and water. The pool is in disrep
We loved this hotel.  Wish they had coffee on site.  Such a simple addition.  We loved the beach in front of the hotel.  We rented chairs and umbrella from isla rentals on fb. They delivered and picked up at the front desk. Room was fine. Would def return!
"Excellent - we arrived without reservation, reception showed us two rooms and we went with Room 8. A king size bed and fridge after two days we decided to extend our stay so we moved to Room 1 which had a small kitchen that made it easier for our baby in a morning.  Overall, the reception, cleaning and bar staff have all been great !!!   We are now thinking of returning for a month later in the year"
"So we ended up booking a last minute deal and our hotel (beautiful next door property) did not have one night so logically we thought about booking as close as possible and ended up at Maria del Mar. The positives: Beautiful beach just as the rest of the resorts, property garden is really nice. Cons: Extremely old, moldy, no wifi (the pool area got crowed just because of the wifi signal). Beds mega mega old. Bathroom old. Our bedding looked clean but room was dusty. AC was bad too. Just very old property wi"
"Do not stay here, place is filthy, disgusting and the owners are useless. There is mold on the pillows, and the plave is unclean. Had some of my belongings stolen, and the owners did nothing to help. Not happy with my stay at all"
Spacious rooms and friendly staff.  The housekeepers went above and beyond to make the stay great.  And you simply can't beat the view!!  The attached pic is from our balcony (that's the railing at the bottom of the pic).  We come to Isla every year and we would certainly stay here again.
"The location, view and really cute rooms got it a 3 star but I’ve seen a lot of recommendations on TripAdvisor telling solo female travelers to come here and I definitely wouldn’t recommend it for those. I simply didn’t feel safe during my stay.   As I’m a solo female traveler myself,  I always request a higher floor when I travel. This hotel in particular made you pay extra for non ground floor rooms. Perfect, right? Wrong! To my dismay, I was placed in a room that I would absolutely consider ground floor."
"We stayed 27th- 29th April, a family of 2 adults 4 kids over 2 rooms. We were given ground floor room 9 and 10.   We thought this hotel, B & b was really cute, the kitchen, and reading room needs an update or a good clean at least, but rooms were clean, with clean beds and fresh towels, toiletries and toilet roll. Air con worked. A fridge was provided. Obviously there was no luxury to the place but the gardens were very neat and tidy, pool was perfect my kids loved it, setting and location was perfect for u"
I spent quite some time here and fell in love with the place. Perfectly situated about a 30 minute walk to Norte beach and about the same going south to the main grocery store v you definitely don't need a golf cart to stay here. My room was #7 and the cleaning of it was impeccable.  The staff was so friendly and management was always there.  No issue with language differences.  I had some personal issues trying to get a friend there from the US and our plans changed 3 different times that would require a l
"Hotel is in a nice location for access to north beach, bars, and restaurants. Located right on Hidalgo. The rooms are clean, and cleaned daily. The pool area was also clean. The hotel is in desperate need of updating and maintenance. A fresh coat of paint would go a long way in starting to help to update the hotel. Our bed was extremely hard and uncomfortable. Our refrigerator was also very noisy. Air conditioner appeared fairly new and worked great. We had a room on the second floor facing the pool. Yes, w"

" come back.   Ladies on reception were polite and helpful, toast and coffee, juice were provided down the street for bfast, again something to put you on but if they could add a plate of fruit to that it would be great. Short stroll to restaurants and main street. In our opinion we would much rather stay here than a more expensive hotel for the chill vibe, met some nice people too as its a nice intimate place.   Bit of problem for us was most of the island doesn't take card payments, I knew this beforehand "
"I came to Isla Mujeras to relax, but that is the last thing that will happen here.  There is loud construction right below my room and the manager is not here so that I can cancel the rest of my stay.  Of course this booking is none-refundable (at $130 a night) according to the front desk associate.  The WiFi does not work and there is very little hot water for a shower.  What a terrible experience.  The view is fantastic, but I would highly recommend that you think twice before staying here."
"We fell in love with this hotel! Just off the street you wouldn’t know the oasis behind the wall. It’s so pretty with sculptures, iguanas, a small pool ( not for lap swimming), a common area, spa, and in general a relaxing island vibe. The location one block from playa Norte and a close walk to all the shops, restaurants, ferry, etc can’t be beat. Our room had two beds, a couch, a small kitchen and an outdoor area that was enough space for our family of four. A coffee maker (bring/buy coffee) some limited k"
"First and foremost it was unfortunate we could not reserve a room in our favorite hotel on the North Beach 🙄!  We decided to give Almendros a try.  I was not comfortable booking but agreed!  We did not find the front desk employees friendly which is unusual since we have been visiting ISLA for 10 years.  There is no privacy when sitting on the patio, lounge chairs around the pool are in the grass where you get bug bites.  Pool is clean but the area around it needs a good cleaning including the walking area "
"We stayed 5 days in this very nice  hotel located in city center just 10 minutes walk from Playa Norte. Great sea view, clean rooms with friendly staff. Fair price  for value you get. Many restaurants around and gricery store. Street food available next to the church. We will be back one day."

"We had an amazing 12 day stay in January to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had a great room with a comfortable bed, King size, full kitchen with everything you need to prepare food & a generous bathroom with a walk in shower. They do a continental breakfast that they will set up wherever you want it, it's basic but it's nice to start the day. The have a very nice pool & a small beach. It's not Playa Norte but it's still right on the water.   The staff are so kind & helpful. They really make the stay e"
" the environment- but I would guess they would do it if you asked. In addition to being close to many restaurants, there is a coffe/pastry shop and some food stand right out the door. Would go back there for sure."
" watch.  What is so strange looks as though about 90 percent of their clientele is English speaking.  Music 🎶 you can hear until the early morning hours.  Beds are firm but we thought they were comfortable, one of the better aspects of this hotel."
"Amazing Hotel for the price!! We stayed here for 4 nights last week.  It was only $56 per night and was more than worth it.  The room was very clean, water pressure was very good, bed was comfortable and had the most amazing sunrises!!! Pool was very nice too.  The property is about a 5 min walk to the beach, grocery store and numerous restaurants.   About a 10 to 15 min walk to Playa Norte.  Also, on 2 or 3 blocks from the Ferry Terminal...straight wall right from the Ferry entrance. "
Got here at 3 with my sons (13&10).  Son went to pee and flushed the toilet. Toilet clogged. We went out to eat and got back at 6. My 10 yrs old needed to go number two. Toilet still clogged and we went to the office to use their toilet. I explained to the two ladies at receptionist that the toilet is clogged and my son needs to use the toilet now. She said I have to go to my room. Again I said the toilet is clogged. I explained to her since we got here at 3. She said this time you can use the toilet but we
Hotel is very basic but it’s clean and in a great location. There are many stairs so if you are one that cannot do stairs this is not the place for you. The owners are very nice. The wifi is only available in the lobby area and out back. It did not reach the bedrooms. I can’t say anything bad about the hotel the only issue we encountered is that one day coming back from the beach we were needing to shower for dinner and there was no water. They said it was getting maintenance on it. We were allowed to showe

"This is an older hotel. Nothing fancy. But... the rooms are huge and everything is very clean. There's a fridge, microwave, toaster, and a few dishes, as well as a safe, in the room. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  The pool is nice, even though it isn't huge, and there are lots of lounge chairs around it in the courtyard. It's on Hidalgo, the main pedestrian street which is full of restaurants, bars, and souvenir shops. It can get noisy at night but my room faced the courtyard and I didn't hear a "
"What I mean by the title of this review is on first appearance the room looks a little old and/or run down but the hotel really grew on my girlfriend and I. So it could use some room darkening curtains and the shower could have a lot better water pressure but once you get over the small things you realize what a bargain this hotel really is. You have a million dollar view, it is about 3 blocks walking a straight shot right off the ferry, you are about a block from the main entertainment/food area Hidalgo st"
" zero star but it’s not an opting apparently. Room wise, small but okay. It has pool and patio. It’s good for two people or one adult and two young children. Location is perfect right in front of Mia reef. Would I stay here again, no. Simply because if I want to spend money, I expect at least a courtesy. I’m going to wait if they’re going to charge me or not and I’ll do my other review.  Btw, there’s no sign not to put toilet paper on the toilet and they didn’t mention anything about it either when checkin "
 are great and busy. Best coffee we ever had was across the street At the cafe. DELICIOUS! I would stay here again.
We absolutely loved this cozy hotel! The location was great just one min walk from playa norte. Very clean and well kept by nice staff. Their english was not very good so it was hard to get any info from the staff at the front desk.  But if you are looking for a beautiful hotell near playa norte this is the place!!!
"Hotel Paradise Suites is the perfect choise if you prefer tranquility, beach close location and an overall very good experience. As many reviewers have mentiones Alex is a great host. We were upgraded to no.11 which was a perfect room, good size and with all necessary amenities.  Everything you will need is either within the premises or just outside, including some of the best places for breakkfast, lunch and dinner.  Those who want healthy superfood will only have to go a few meters. Alex is fluently in en"
"My wife and I, along with another couple, are vacationing on Isla Mujeres.  We booked these rooms 6 months ago, bit that apparently doesn't count towards a preferred room location.  Our  ""overlooking the pool"" room is, as you can see, it overlooks the back of the roof construction area.  In addition to our beautiful view, we are also the only room in the hotel without a balcony or patio, and we suffered through 2 days without any hot water before they fixed the problem. The wi-fi has not worked since we got"
"Great view, and easy walk to downtown/ferry.  We rented a golf cart, and they had a nice gated area to park it overnight.  Pool was too cold in December, but the view was outstanding.  We went to beach club on North Beach during the day to enjoy the beautiful water."

"We didn't know what to expect at Na Balam but were pleasantly surprised. Rooms were very clean and basic but more than enough for what we needed. Pool area is nice though very shady and reminded us of Bali. Our 5 yr old loved the pool. The hotel is very quiet with only 12 or so rooms so is a little oasis. The daily yoga classes (small cost) were great and Lal was an amazing instructor, especially to our 5 year old! Only downside was how busy the beach was.

Unique and quiet. Rooms are clean and large. Bring your own coffee for the coffee maker provided. On site message is a must! Friendly helpful staff. No In room safe so had to carry passport and money with at all times.  Walking distance to beach and many eateries.
 we did.  Probably won't do this place again
"We love Villa Kiin. This was our 8th time visiting, and it never disappoints. Small resort with all rooms facing the ocean.  Nice new pool and steps from a nice lagoon.   A 5 minute walk to el Centro and around the corner from North Garden restaurant and the Mercado"
The rooms are set amongst leafy grounds which inspire peace and rest.  It’s in a great location very near the beach and the Main Street for restaurants and bars.  Staff were friendly and rooms were well cleaned.  The pool is a good size and yoga classes are run but an excellent guy called Lal.
"When on Isla Mujeres, I always stay at Bucaneros.  Located on Hidalgo St., very close to restaurants and shops.  Room is always fresh and clean, breakfast is from 7:30 to 11:30, staff are very friendly.  I have no complaints about this fine hotel."
"This property  is situated three minutes walk from the beach and this is it's main advantage. Since we were a group of 14, it was also important that it has nice recreation areas to congregate as a group on the premises. Manager Alex is very accommodating, rooms are well cleaned every day. However the property itself  is pretty run down. Jacuzzi full of water but dirty and not working. During our week stay there were periods of time up to several hours there were no electricity (air-conditioning, fridge), t"

"We stayed at this hotel for two nights in a small honeymoon bungalow.  Check is was easy and quick.  Our room was clean and comfortable, but we never had hot water in the bathroom.  The bed was very comfortable and the small fridge worked well.  The TV remote never worked but it was only two nights, did not really miss the TV.  The location was great, right on the bay and close to restaurants and Playa Norte."
"We came here for a friend’s birthday. They stayed  at a more expensive hotel that was all booked up, so we were just “accidentally” at Na Balam.  What a glorious accident!  Management communicated with us before check-in, which was simple and flawless.  We were provided bottled water in an artistic carafe, freshened up daily.  Room was clean and simple.  I read a review earlier about the room smelling good, and it’s true!!  I got home, and all my clothes still smelled like the room.  Amazing!  The pool is t"
"Great place for the price. Perfect location on Hidalgo street. Cold A/C, hot shower, comfy beds. Had a great working small fridge. Room is small but perfect. Did not give 5 stars because room was on top floor and stairs were steep. Will return."
" back on the property to open the door for us.  Kitchenette in each room is pathetic, it has one electric burner that only accommodates local pots and pans which are so worn out and burned that it was virtually impossible to cook there. I bought a new pan in local supermarket and discovered it won't work on this type of burner. Utensils and plates are hard to come across, had to scramble from room to room to find something that would be sufficient to feed a family.  One of the worst features is that air-con"
"Because this is right on Hidalgo and the bars are loud and go very late it can be disturbingly noisy if you don’t get an inside room.  Room is clean, bathroom is nice and there is hot water and water pressure."
We initially booked our stay for July 2020 but due to COVID 19 travel cancellations we were unable to take this planned vacation. I contacted the hotel several times to discuss options on refund or credit for the  1st day on 2 rooms. They would not give ant type of refund or credit.  In August 2021 me and my Fiancé we for a 3 day stay at the hotel because we were drawn by the pictures and location. There were a few bad incidents that sealed our decision to never stay there again. We both fell on wet slipper
 Balam again!
"I returned to the Bucaneros Hotel and Suites because I had such a wonderful experience and have referred friends to stay, as it is steps away from everything fun! Unfortunately, the quality and maintenance of the hotel has gone downhill and its not due to the wonderful ladies that clean the rooms. We reserved our room online prior to arriving, they had no reservation upon arriving, put us in room 102, which we were told was a balcony room, NO it was a small window that you had to crawl thru that if shut wou"

"It was amazing!!! Paradise totally!! Everything is incredible, specially the views. We stayed at one of the bungalows and it was magical! We absolutely loved it. The food was pretty good too. The only reason it is not getting all 5 stars is because there is no AC in the room. I understand that they may do it because it is not eco-friendly but it is needed. We were sweating because the room was like an oven at night. Regardless it was awesome and I think only the cabins don’t have AC, but they are incredible"

"Pros  Beautiful view, kayaks free to use. Small newly built detached compounds. Out door gym Cons Far from town on a bumpy dirt road. You need SUV. No fridge, no microwave, no tv, no wifi, no safe or place to hang clothes, Kitchen is far from the restaurant. It is not stocked. The employees make the best of what they they have. Takes 15 min for a cup of hot water for tea and 20+ for a cup of coffee. Pool dirty asked why they dont clean it. Employee said the pump was broken. We then tried to fill the large s"
" rooms needed the scared up walls painted, the towels were stained and the bathroom walls and doors were stained with things that I probably don't want to know. The noise from the daily garbage trucks, yelling employees trying to get scooters and tables moved for the garbage to be picked up was ridiculous. The pictures reflected on this site DO NOT REPRESENT WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTING.  The price is low but so are the standards in which you will be staying, the change over of people is daily, as I think peopl"
"Great location, amazing service, good size rooms mostly. Alex, the general manager is an amazing person, always ready to help. Hope to return there soon. Just minutes from the beach. Two great restaurants just outside of the hotel."
This is now one of our favorite places on the world! Super clean beautiful place made with respect to nature and run by people who have interest in conserving and respecting this natural beauty while offering a great comfort to their guests. We want to come back.!
I am staying right now at this property. I am on the “other side of the road” and it seems like the beach side is being renovated. For $100 a night with tax we have a nice size room with a nice size bathroom. It overlooks a cozy jungle like courtyard and small pool. The clerk at the check in is super nice. The room is clean and the bedding smells nice LOL. The best part about this property is the location. You can walk out on the street and turn right and be right at the calm section of north beach where my
 Luckily we only stayed here 2 days.

De foto's kloppen maar de service is een grote zero ! Zeer ongeïnteresseerd en als je geen wagen hebt moet je al een taxi hebben voor een simpel drankje want tegen de vroege avond is de bar /resteau gesloten als t al open gaat en de winkel aan de overkant is ook vroeg gesloten en aan de receptie hoef je niks te vragen  ! De prijzen van een kayak zijn overdreven hoog . Ook de kamer werd niet opgefrist maar kon k nog meeleven als ze al verse handdoeken hadden gebracht ...maar nee ;) t  ontbijt is schaars en d

"Beautiful rooms on stilts on the lagoon. Comfort is what can you can expect for this kind of room. Magical view. Do not miss the sunrise.  Food is ok and not expensive. Some activities to do on the lagoon, such as paddle or kayaking. Very nice staff. No A/C, but it is better for the environment."
"I want to give a shout out to this hotel for their customer service during the COVID pandemic! I booked through a third party under a no change /no cancellation booking. My travel date needed to be changed so I decided to try with no real expectation. Well, I am thrilled to report that they let me change my date! Im so impressed with their generosity and superb customer service! Thank you Na Balam! I absolutely  love this hotel. The grounds are so beautiful, the beach is amazing and the customer service top"
"The menger  lenny and luis very nice and very kind. Lots of aquatic activites:water skiing, kayaking, tubing and more. Specacular views and delicious food. Varmly recommended . Stunning boutique hotel. "
"Basics are not settled: check in is a mess (hotel was empty and they couldn't check my family in before 3 pm claiming hotel was full), garbage is burnt just next to the rooms (when complaining about it they offered a bottle of wine for the inconvenience... WHAAT?? Wine in exchange of my health?? ), showers are next to toilets (you can imagine WC end up soaked after showering);  drain in bathrooms smell really bad ; pool is dirty; food is expensive and meh (we ate everyday out); it's very far from Bacalar ce"
"La chambre n'était pas terrible, le douche avait un débit très bas et peu d'eau chaude. Les portes en boisétaient assez vieilles.  Je ne vous parle pas du soi-disant wifi qui ne marche quasiment pas.  Au petit déjeuner un café et des œufs. Et si vous êtes allergiques aux œufs, avec un peu de chance s'ils ont ce jour-là, vous aurez un toast avec uniquement du beurre. Le service du petit déjeuner était très long...

"Estamos haciendo un viaje por carretera Cdmx- Cancún, y este hotel fue el lugar que elegí para descansar en Bacalar, principalmente por encontrarse a la orilla de la laguna Bacalar. La publicidad que usa este hotel es engañosa, fotos que muestran un lugar sencillo pero con lo necesario para una cómoda estancia.  Pero a nuestra llegada tuvimos una mala experiencia. El lugar requiere mucho mantenimiento en las puertas del baño y de la habitacion que en la parte inferior están desgastadas o rotas y permiten el"
This was an extremely clean nice hotel on the Main Street in Isla Mujeres. It is family run and they are very helpful. I have no complaints on anything. I’m just sorry I haven’t written it before now. Very reasonable prices also. We had a balcony room overlooking the Main Street.
"The staff at Hotel Bucanaros hotel and suites went above and beyond to help us with Covid testing for our return to the US. They made all arrangements for the Doctor to come to the hotel for the swabs, opened a private area for testing and collected the results for us. It was so easy. The staff here are the best."
"I’ve stayed with my other half for two days in Cabaña 1. What a beautiful place to be! The staff is super friendly and welcomed us perfectly.   Jaime took us around the hotel area (there is a huge land) and with all his love and attention made sure we could understand the purpose of the place. A sustainable and in complete unison with its environment.   For who comes you must visit the temple on site while you are here!  Remember: Instagram does not show the place how it really is, so don’t choose not comin"
"I spent a long time looking for a hotel:   In Playa Norte With A/C  Small(not a resort) On the Beach With restaurant on site   In spite of some of the negative reviews, took a chance on this hotel and it paid off; it was wonderful. Just as it looks on the pictures.  We stayed in a deluxe room with a king bed on a second floor with a partial view of the beach: gorgeous!   I wasn’t counting on a TV and mini fridge in the room. Nice surprise!  WiFi is slows but works in the room, restaurant and even at the bea"
" managed, they have good intentions but can't compensate vs owner prioritie's and unexperienced in the hotel business (we heard him talking poorly about his staff in front of the guests). We won't go back there! Prices are double vs other hotels and it is definitely NOT worth the cost. "
"Faites comme nous ! Fuyez !! A peine arrivé, déjà reparti .. on avait booké 3 nuits on est resté 1 heure ..pas de frigo, pas de WiFi, le ménage pas fait , salle de bain avec de la moisissure, manque un robinet .  porte fenêtre qui ne ferme pas qui se bloque avec un bâton .. ponton dangereux avec des clous rouillés qui dépassent .

" con la llave del agua fria, en la mano; nunca salió agua tibia  solo agua fria, al informar al responsable sus respuestas fueron: es la llave izquierda, cierre y vuelva abrir, llamaré a mantenimiento, ""otro cliente lo reportó y así lo resolvió ya no regreso"" sin tener la certeza que realmente se resolvió.  Hora y media después de nuestra llegada solicite la cancelación y reembolso del importe de la habitación y lo hicieron, cosa que agradezco porque nos permitió buscar en lugar en mejores condiciones."
"A simple and super nice hotel on a SUPER SPOT. The hotel rooms that face the water are literally on the lagoon. It´s a romantic spot that´s perfect to spend a day or two lying in the sun, and dipping on the fresh water."
"Loved the vibe, the bungalows and the food. I also took a massage and a reiki therapy, amazing!!!! I would only suggest they cleaned more the room. The walls had a bunch of previously dead mosquitos and the beds would get very dirty from the wind and were not cleaned. The rest, is a jungle experience you can’t miss.  "
" other requests and they shut down early enough.   I wish the room had a coffee machine and a full body mirror. Just being picky here.   Guillermina, at the front desk, and Gaspar at the restaurant were super nice and helpful.   We are going back to this hotel. "
…
"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The property could use a bit more love (ie. the pier is broken in a few places, the garden can use some trimming, etc).  We asked for a two bedroom, which we received. But the second room was more like a walk in closet converted into a bedroom. It's great for kids, but probably a bit more uncomfortable for adults. Otherwise, the location is very central and the views are absolutely stunning."
"Acceso privado a la laguna, con un muelle excelente, instalaciones de primera, habitaciones super comodas y sobre todo la atención del personal fue impecable, no se arrepentiran de pasar sus vacaciones en este hotel"
"We were excited to stay here we were informed the morning of arrival at 9:30am that we could not enter the grounds until 3pm check in time. The gate would be locked for a retreat, no waiting at the restaurant, lobby or dropping off bags. We made the best of it of course and wondered around town with luggage. Nothing was done to make up for the inconvenience and at that price we are expected at least to be able to wait in a lobby. At the restaurant there was no fish for both days because of a group that came"

"When you finally, after a 10 minute drive on a putt-hole filled, bumpy road reach the property, you are greeted by an amazing view on Lagoon Bacalar. The neatly designed lay-out of the hotel with its weirdly shaped, put privacy-improving sit/swimming-pool, of which only one of the two Jacuzzis functions, gives you a perfect hide-away to relax, weren't it for the bad service and underwhelming amenities. Even though they offer free use of their kayaks and you can rest idyllically in one of the hammocks, you a"
"Después de una confusión por el nombre (confundimos el hotel A´akal con Casa Aakal) la estancia fue muy agradable. El lugar es muy bonito, tranquilo, tiene su propio muelle en la laguna. Muy buenos los desayunos y a excelente precio. Las habitaciones muy amplias, bien equipadas, las camas muy cómodas. Sobresaliente la atención del personal, en especial José, que se esmera en hacer de la estadía una experiencia de confort y atención muy buena. Sin duda regresaría."
"For us it was the closest experience to paradise. The place has a magic vibe since the main entrance. Going through the road to get to the hotel was truly enjoyable.  The hotel is absolutely nature friendly. We stayed at one of the 5 cabins. All of them on the lake. The private deck was perfect for our anniversary.  Everything works perfectly, the staff always helpful and caring. Made a big difference in the whole experience.  I wish I could have the opportunity to go back as much as we can!  "
Very cozy. The cabins are literally on the lagoon which make the deck view and the experience one of a kind. All the staff are super friendly. The saliing boat tour is a must. Would definitely return.
"This place is a gem. Tucked away right on the lagoon. The staff and service are amazing. On the grounds there is a permaculture garden, which you can tour, kayaks and paddle boards to take on the lake as well as a temple- that is artfully constructed. I hope to return soon. Highly recommend a stay while on the lake."
"My boyfriend and I have been spending the past 5 nights here and have witnessed how committed to the guests the staff are here at the hotel. Last night, the incredible bartender and waiter Miguel moved the dining table out to the sundeck at sunset and we enjoyed a wonderful dinner oceanside. It was incredible and made us feel so special.   William, the hotel manager has been wonderful as well, helping us book taxis, find bike rentals, booked our massage and has made us very comfortable and welcome here.   T"
"It's a very nice hotel, at a good location in Isla. We took the loft room, bug and comfy. The air conditioning, unfortunately, was not able to cool the room so well. The pool is tiny. The stuff in the coffee house is nice but we had trouble getting our orders like they show in the menu. Do NOT order Ice coffee:)"
"My husband and I were so excited to return to Hotel La Joya, after staying here in 2017 and having a wonderful experience. This time was significantly different. It is still a gorgeous, unique and (mostly) quiet place to stay, but the property needs some serious maintenance and the follow through/attentiveness of the staff has definitely declined since our last stay. The most constant and easily preventable issue was breakfast. It is supposed to be delivered each morning (set on the table outside your room)"
" to the kitchen to ask if they'd forgotten us, or we had to ask for a new piece of paper each day. The man in the office could not be bothered to get out of his chair to help and just pointed to the kitchen/restaurant when we tried to get more clear instructions/information.  The continential breakfast itself is great and sitting on our patio looking out at the water HAD BEEN one of our favorite things about this hotel. But, having to figure out the dysfunctional system and asking what was going on each mor"
"This is potentially a great boutique hotel.   The plus's are many and the negatives are few.   The rooms are basic with good beds, a good bathroom facility, and the staff does a great job of daily room service.   The biggest downside is the distance to get to the north beach, which if you don't want to walk the 20 minutes, you can hail a bus for 20 pesos per person or a cab is 80 pesos.   The other downside is late evening noise from the neighboring hostel.  The breakfast room on the top floor offers great "
"We’ve been here 3 times and the events are just so much fun! Maru served us and even if she don’t understand english well she managed to serve everything we ordered and she was soooooo caring and gentle!  Thank you, we’ll be back for sure!"

"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Bahia Chac Chi! The staff were welcoming and helpful, the rooms were clean and comfortable, offered a delicious Continental breakfast, located near the harbor, and provided beautiful views from our room!"
"I booked 3 rooms for 2 nights December 28 &29.  I had to cancel one room on boxing day due to testing positive for Covid.  The property was contacted on December 26, and said that their supervisor would contact in the morning about if a refund was possible.  the next day I received an email requesting proof of testing positive.  Because i was sick, and my test was a rapid test that was thrown away, it took me a bit of time to get documentation confirming the positive result as I had to ask for a confirmatio"
"We came to the techno music party on Saturday. Place looked so beautiful and charming at the very first moment. Unfortunately, we have been scammed at the bar at the party place, girl who was working at the bar stole money, and reacted as it nothing happened, please be careful and try to avoid this place!!!"
"This is a charming secluded place. The view was spectacular and really made the place. The decor is old Mexican and we enjoy that. Service was good. Only small gripe was the breakfast service. Although delicious, they didn't really make it as easy as it should have been. We kinda felt we were begging for something that was included. Pool is small, but clean. Steps are a nightmare, but other reviews warned us. We made an informed choice to save money, but probably not for us again due to minor disabilities."
We stayed at this cute hotel once before and liked it.  However this trip was very disappointing.  First day we woke up to chain saws and hammering because they were doing work on the property.   I complained but they still continued the noise our entire stay.  It was quiet the day we were leaving.   We only had ONE vacation in 2021 so it’s unfortunate we had to hear so much noise.  You couldn’t even sit by the pool.  We won’t be back
" concern, and repeated that i dint get a refund because I dint show up.  Well, hard to get on a plane with covid..... but that it what they expected me to do. The 4 other hotels on my trip all gave refunds.  other properties will- don't risk this place that has no concern for your safety.  Stay away, they only care about taking your money."
"Staff were unfriendly, the WiFi never worked in the bedroom. I had a micro room and was facing the front entrance on the road - try and avoid these rooms, they’re so loud.  Mega sized ants in the room, sometimes in the bed. The shared bathrooms were pretty gross, the floors were always soaking wet and they were tiny cubicles containing a shower and a toilet! The receptionist one day tried to charge me £15 per towel as they had stains on, one was just shampoo, I mean, aren’t white towels going to get stains "
"As corona is still blocking a lot of people from travelling some hotels offer a limited number of iptions. Such was the case with la Joya. Having aaid that, the place is beautiful, set in a lot of green in a secluded spot.Thr rooms all have sea view and are well appointed. In the morning breakfast was served at the patio of our room which was really nice. All in all a very nice stay...."
"Manager Oswaldo is a true gentleman. A world class concierge. This place is lucky to have him.   This was our last three nights before our return to Europe. The only room that could accommodate four people did not have the view we expected and we were obviously dissapointed. He immediately found a solution by moving us to a better room for that night and said he would try to find a solution for the remaining two nights, but because everything was fully booked he couldn't promise anything. Hours later he del"

Oh well, that just means we have to come back! ;-)  Miguel, by the bar was also very professional and friendly. He served the best mango mojito my wife, myself -and by the looks of it every guest in hotel- have ever tasted!   Our only critique was the music by the pool bar. So unnessesary!

This hotel has terrible water pressure and no hot water I haven't washed my hair in 5 days.! Breakfast here used to be decent I've stayed here five times before. I will post a picture breakfast. Sugary juice no coffee but you're supposed to make your own coffee with they're gross looking coffee pot. You can't flush toilet paper down the toilet they want you to put it in a garbage can which to me says hostile not hotel!

We ordered a shrimp dish, aguachile, and it had a half shrimp on it. Several times during our stay, we couldn´t order food or drinks, because there was no service, I tried ordering room service, and they answered that there were only fried dishes.

"We had a great time and met a lot of nice people. We loved the activities like yoga, HIT workout and the karaoke. One of the staff members Lars gave us good advices for food and spots on the island.

" need to wash my hair so Sheraton here I come. I always ask myself if I would stay at the hotel again? No!! Because there are newer better hotels.

"we absolutely loved to stay here our 2 nights were amazing!  the rooms were big and luxurious, we had the whole pool for ourselves and we had the best food ever the menu is incredible delicious and price worthy.  the staff is amazing they work hard to make you feel welcomed and give the best customer service we had in the whole mexico.  They provided help with the golf cart rentals and set the jacuzzi on time for us.   Our experience here was by far the best!"
Selina es la mejor opcion si estas en Isla Mujeres.. Hay clases de yoga.. Meditacion.. Snorkeling.. Bar and everything make your holidays like be in Paradise...perfect to make a lot of friends if you are solo traveler...

"Stay away from this hotel. Besides the fact that it looks like a cheap hotel (nothing like the pics) and far from everything..They have a fraudulent staff and overall horrible customer service! We stayed here for 2 nights and suffered. The smell i the room was so bad, and their solution was to call a cleaning person to spray bad perfume. It was a joke.

"We wrote to the hotel that we will arrive a bit early and they said we can't get the rooms before 15:00, at 15:00 they said the rooms are nor ready and they have only one cleaning worker, at 15:30 they said in will take one more hour, I came back 16:30 and they said it is still not ready, When i said it's not OK the receptionist (fani) told me to go and complain to the manager which will be here tommorow.  I booked the rooms one month ago but they said they were not ready for us to come today. Worst service"
"I spent a three-day weekend at this all-inclusive and I enjoyed my stay. The staff was nice, although it took them a long time to bring drinks, even when the pool or dining room was not busy. We had a large room with two queen beds and the room cleaning service was good. I loved the large bathrooms. They only thing missing from the room was a chair and desk, which was odd because there was enough space. I don't think that I will return to Isla Mujeres. It was exhausting coming from the airport to the ferry "
Let me start by saying the service is excellent the people are friendly. Polite and truly want to make your stay rememberable.  However the booking process was less than forthright. Our reservation total was $987 American when we got to the hotel they charge us $1250 American and then claimed that the bank took the rest of a charge for the transfer rate which is bowl because I paid by credit card and the visa card handles the exchange rate also they put us in a smaller room we had booked a junior suite and 
"Excellent Service, excellent food, excellent location!!! On south side of the island (quieter) which is what I preferred. still easy to get in to town. Beautiful rooms, property. Front desk was amazing as well as the food (so good). Do not have one bad thing to say. Could of used in house laundry service (just a thought ') Thank you Hotel Belo for an incredible holiday"
"This is a lovely hotel, however, they have a system of transferring USD to pesos that causes them to overcharge. The young lady at the desk took the amount she said was due for the room and multiplied it by 20 (the amount she said each $1 USD was worth). However, she did that on a simple calculator. The rate per USD was actually less and she just rounded up which caused me to be over charged. Even after explaining that, she was convinced she was actually even charging me less than my reservation confirmatio"
From the moment I booked I was treated with White Glove service from Alexander!  He is amazing and went above and beyond to make our stay here FANTASTIC!!!  Rooms are decorated with the right amount of neutral colors- not to take away from the beauty of the island and the views from room.  Enjoy your stay- you will not be disappointed!!
"Our travel agent recommended Lotus Beach Hotel and I'm so glad he did! We came here after a stay at one of my favorite places in Playa del Carmen, which is hard to top, but Lotus Beach topped it! The whole place is beautiful and has a wonderful feel.  We were greeted with the house drink, the Guru (a delicious take on a margarita, with passion fruit and habenero) and cool towels, then taken to our amazing room with its own private plunge pool overlooking the beach. The room amenities were top notch (BVLGARI"
" for her explanation of Mayan astrology, which was fascinating.) Mayte especially felt like a friend who just so happened to work here.  The food and drinks were all terrific. In addition to the Guru, I highly recommend the Agra - it's like a Pina Colada but not frozen and not overly sweet. The ceviche serving size is massive and could be a full meal all by itself, and we could not stop eating that and the various tacos. The pool/bar area was a great place to hang out when we weren't enjoying our private pl"

"We had absolutely no idea about the Island but kept on seeing Lotus on searches. I called one day and Alexander answered. From that 1 min call we then msged as I was in the UK. Honestly we have never experienced customer service like it. Alex used to send me the odd message, even room upgrade when availability changed. He couldn’t have done enough. Unfortunately we never got to meet as he was away for our visit but everyone at Lotus was fantastic. It’s definitely the coolest vibe on Playa Norte. The afterno"
"I was extremely disappointed after staying 3 nights here.  Maybe I would rate it higher if there wasn’t such a mismatch between the sticker price and the experience.  It is not a tranquil, zen-like place as their website implies.  Rather, it’s a beach club with some nice rooms too.  For example, we arrived at about 3:30pm last Friday and wanted to have lunch after traveling. There was a 7-piece band and about 50-60 people around the pool patio, rocking their butts off.  Good band and people were really enjo"
" having such a good time out there for some reason.  Oh ya!  Doesn't this place only have 6 rooms total?  We were specifically allowed only 2 people in our room.  How big are these 5 other rooms? The food was good, the service mediocre at best but not surprising given how hard the staff had to work to accommodate all those other people, who obviously must have had lots of drink orders.   We didn’t eat there again so cannot accurately rate their food.  Just keep in mind that this place is open to the public "

"Great place. Staff was very attentive. Some of the staff went above and beyond!! Just be weary…it is a Beach Club first and a boutique hotel second. We were super excited to stay here, seemed exclusive since there were only six rooms. BUT, they have daily walk-in guests that pay to use the pool and beach and the staff caters to them. That’s fine if you advertise that clearly on your hotel website. We were very much taken aback by that. It was still enjoyable, but when you read only six rooms, understand tha"
"July 4th birthday celebration at the amazing Lotus Beach Hotel. This property is private, with beautiful decors. The location is private with the plunge pool right outside of your door. We picked this hotel based on recommendation of family members and also the reviews here. The wonderful staffs, Alexander, Juan, Danny, Jesus, Juan .... thank you everything and also to help us arrange for the Covid testings for our return. "
"NIGHTMARE FOR COUPLES! Overpriced ‘hotel rooms’ in a hostel with loud party music all day until 2 am. Unfriendly and uninterested staff at the reception who do not care to give you a good stay. I stayed here 3 nights to celebrate my honeymoon, but I wish I had the guts to leave this place after our first night. Instead of catching some sleep and relaxing, we had a very unpleasant stay."
Was there for nearly a week at this lush tropical sanctuary.  Never stayed at a hotel/hostel but I really like it and would come back again and again.   Traveled with a friend (both LGBT travelers)  and we felt very comfortable.     Nice mix of party and chill atmosphere.  Service was great and the shinning stars were Jose and Rafa.   Very attentive and always smiling.  But everyone there was generally nice.  The room was ok it was a little beat up.   It was a room with two beds but you can tell it was a do
"Playa La Media Luna was perfect. It was in a great location, the price was right, and the scenery from the pool was beautiful. It may not have been the newest build on Isla but by no means was it dumpy or dirty. One of the managers (unfortunately I forgot his name) gave us some fantastic restaurant recommendations.  I would definitely stay here again."
"Nomads is an absolutely beautiful place. The location on the beach is great to chill during the day and the large deck provides amazing sunset views. I love that some nights they have live music and on other nights a DJ is playing. I have stayed in both the female 8 person dorm and in private rooms and both were great: the rooms are beautiful, clean and the beds are very comfy. The staff is very kind and willing to help (especially Arturo the manager), the cocktails are great and the food from the foodmarke"
"Just terrible. We stayed here our last night to go to a “nicer” place for one night. Do yourself a favor and don’t. We can definitely recommend Casa Azul Maya!  - no hospitality - everything in our tiny dingy room was cheap and on the verge of breaking or was broken - no continental breakfast available anymore  - we arrived an hour before check in and rang the bell at the front desk, I was addressed with a very annoyed looking woman saying “digame!?” (Tell me in Spanish). Needless to say there was definitel"
"I absolutely loved my stay at Casa de los Sueños. My boyfriend and I were there for 2 days and 3 nights for a quick vacation and couldn't have asked for a more beautiful, relaxing spot.  The room was great! Colorful, quirky decor (preferable IMO over a stuffy sterile hotel room vibe), very comfortable bed, and an absolutely breathtaking view of the ocean!  The infinity pool was perfect. We went during the ""off-season"" I think so we were generally the only ones in the pool which was amazing. Felt like a priv"
"This hostel is absolutely beautiful.   From the decor, to the large airy bright dorms with large lockers, comfie beds, doesn't feel cramped.  Even a balcony to air dry our towels and swimsuits. Toilets and showers kept clean. Grounds are amazing. Pool is so pretty. You feel very zen here. Like being in the jungle. One of my favourite hostels i've ever stayed in.  Would return."
"It's impossible to sleep because the bar plays the music all the night at a volume so high that the windows are vibrating. When you check-in they tell you that this is a party hotel but in the description of the hotel there wasn't any suggestion that this would have been the situation, and of course you find out the reality of the place when it's to late to get your money back (a pretty good amount of money btw). I'm giving one out of 5 just because i can't give 0. The worst place of mexico with no doubt, a"
Excellent facility and customer service.  The staff was courteous and accommodating and made my wife and me feel welcomed   The location is ideal for exploring the island and I highly recommend this boutique hotel.   We had a wonderful experience due to the professional staff
"This is our second visit to Zoetry Villa Rolandi and it did not disappoint! We had a wonderful stay and have only fabulous comments regarding the resort, rooms, the beach and pool areas and of course, the amazing staff! We love the small feel to the resort as it only has 35 rooms. The restaurants are both delicious and we really enjoyed our 7 course tasting two nights we visited. The rooms all have excellent views and are clean, comfortable. We had some amazing staff we would like to thank: Malena, Luis, Th"
 not to go here.
" Ocean access without the hot sand :)  We also rented a golf cart for our time there which I would definitely recommend. Casa de los Sueños is on the south, more chill side of the island, but with our cart we were able to zip into town for food and to the north side of the island for a little beach time (~15 minute cart ride)  Great hotel and great service. Definitely recommend for a more relaxing Isla Mujeres getaway!"
We enjoyed your outstanding service in an extraordinary place. Thank you for having us it was an experience we will never forget♥️ The partys were great and the vibe and drinks aswell. The hotel is amazingly located we have enjoyed the sunsets and beach.   Greetings Laura and the swiss chicas😘
"We stayed at Hotel Secreto for our final three nights of a three week Mexican vacation. Without a doubt it was our best three nights in Mexico. Just a very short walk from the beach, food carts and restaurants, the hotel feels a 1,000 miles away from everything - truly a secret hideaway. It was totally relaxing. The rooms were large, spotless, and beautifully appointed. There was plenty of hot water and great water pressure in the shower. The king sized bed was super comfortable and it was the best sleep of"
 gave our dog a complimentary massage! Ulysses and Ybarra with the beach side services always wore a smile and made sure our drinks were never empty! We were so touched by all the front desk staff who put together a photo book of our dog's visit; they were all so wonderful and accommodating! We will return!

"I stayed here in March, the weather was absolutely amazing and the hotel services was top notch. I stayed in the suite with the room that had the balcony bathtub facing the dock. Amazing view.   I left in a hurry and I left my Laptop underneath the sheets and Daniel, the manager was able to ship the laptop back to me in the United States. Daniel, from start to end with exceptional customer service, even when I was no longer a customer. Many thanks !"
…
"Amazing place to stay and party. As a solo traveler I loved the vibe, the staff and volunteers were always very friendly and helpful :) Loooooved the smoothies every morning by the beach (prettiest beach club I’ve ever seen) I’ll definitely be back soon!"
"I had the best experience of my life! Arturo accommodated our group for an amazing stay! Reservations were easy, and the beach parties unfortunately (even with all the incredible tequila)! Bar tenders were beautiful and entertaining! I can’t wait till my next stay!"
"We have been staying here at Privilege Aluxes for the past four years. We are always greeted by a very friendly staff at the front desk, Jesus, Johnny, Cynthia, Ofelia, and Ervin. They remember us and make us feel at home. The security staff are also very friendly. This is one of the many reasons why we continue to come to Privilege Aluxes."
 and knew all of the guests by name. They always stopped everything to answer questions and help us have an even better vacation. They even arrange a doctor to come to the hotel to do the Covid test on-site for getting back into the US. We absolutely loved our stay and highly recommend Hotel Secreto.

I wish I could take credit for finding this gem but my neighbor gets all the kudos.  Words to describe this hotel: quaint; great location; terrific view especially at sunrise; quiet during our visit; comfy beds and pillows; nicely sized rooms; nice pool furniture; small beach but take caution in swimming (red flag area); one block from the bus stop and Covid test station; three short blocks to the north end of Hidalgo Street.  This hotel is not an all-inclusive but there are many wonderful restaurants nearb
"This trip was amazing! The hotel was very clean and well appointed! From the hotel staff to the restaurant and pool bar staff, everyone went above and beyond to ensure your enjoyment. I especially want to thank Claudia who took care of us at the main pool bar. She was very sweet, and fun, and made sure we had everything we wanted/needed. She never missed a beat! We can’t wait to return!"
"This hotel is beautiful and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Room was perfect and balcony views were amazing.  It was quiet and didn't hear other guests in our room.  We stayed in the Amor room. The staff is great.  Carlos, Valerie and Chris helped us anytime we had questions.  They setup up transport, a golf care and covid tests for us.  I definitely would stay here again."
I am so thankful for the wonderful staff at Nomads. I was here for a yoga retreat on the island and had a blast. The staff were so delightful and helpful! Our lodgings in the hostel were clean and met my standards. I received great recommendations on things to do on the island. Nomads is such a beautiful paradise. The hammocks and furniture set up on the beach is a dream. The parties at Nomads were so fun and lively! We met so many great people from all over the world. This was a great experience! I definit
"I stayed here as a part of a yoga retreat in isla mujeres.  I loved how they incorporated nature into the buildings there are plants and palm trees everywhere!  I ended up staying in a shared room with 7 other women for the retreat the room had 2 restrooms, 2 bathrooms and AC unit, lockers and a balcony with a hammock.  There is access to the beach with a bar and a pool attached to it.  There is a pier you can jump into the water from which was a lot of fun! Only downside is that the stairs you use to climb"
"Beach, pool, sabor and satay service has been top notch. A few Outstanding individuals who have gone above and beyond, and I am missing some, are Dani, Misael,, Ricardo and Alex. We are welcomed every year with smiles, welcomes and hugs. The Outstanding individuals of this resort keep us coming back. See you next year!  Well done Diego!"

"From catamaran pickup to ferry departure, this was an amazing experience.   The transfer from airport to Dreams Vista dock was easy and then the walk to the catamaran gave us a chance to see the property of Dreams Vista. Be aware there is a little walk and climbing aboard a small catamaran on a floating dock.   Upon arrival, we were welcomed home and easily checked in with 4 other couples. They had this process perfectly scheduled so everyone was helped at once. This was unlike anything we had previously ex"
"Special is the best word to describe Playa la Media Luna.  Very private and quite retreat away from the action in Isla, and only a few short blocks away.  The pool & beach area are some of the most majestic views and scenery you will ever experience.  Staff there was absolutely great and everyone treats you like family.   If you are lucky enough to find your self in Isla, you absolutely have to book an offshore fishing trip or three with Captain Buddy on the Keen M II.  World class sailfish bite with some o"
One of the best places I've ever stayed at. This place has just an amazing vibe and is located directly in front of the lagoon. The garden is super beautiful and from the Yoga Shala you have a stunning view at the lagoon. The vegan restaurant just serves natural and fresh food. I could die for the smoothies and my body feels rejuvenated after the stay in Lulú la Bruja. The staff is always in a good mood creating an atmosphere to simply feel welcome and comfortable. All together I can highly recommend this B
Probably the best experience of my 30 day vacation.  They are not kidding when they say you will swim with the whale sharks twice. When the whale shark appears it’s a go go go and you are so close to this whale shark. It was a great experience. Afterwords we could swim in this very nice area and look for marine life. It was great. Manuel is very helpful too
"We honestly loved our stay at Casa de Los Suenos. We travelled around Yucatan over 15 days including  stays at some of the best known All Inclusives but this was by far our favourite hotel. The views are beautiful, the beds are comfortable (and large!) and the welcome drinks in the fridge a bonus.   The beach club offers the use of paddle boards, kayaks and snorkels with a swing off the deck into the sea. All great fun.   Finally, the staff (and the pets!) are fabulous and really helpful.  We spent a lovely"
"I stayed at this hotel for two nights in August 2017 as part of a group tour. I stayed in a double room. The room was spacious and the AC worked well. There was no WiFi in the room, but spotty coverage was available in the lobby/common areas. The pipes in the bathroom emitted a strong sulfur-like/sewage smell. When I informed the front desk, they said they would take care of it--when I came back to the room later, it smelled very strongly of a chemical disinfectant which they had poured down the drains to c"
"Perfect location, Awesome staff, clean comfortable rooms and lounge area! Free coffee,  croissants and fruit in the morning! Kayak rental was cheaper than at the lake!Cannot say enough good things about this place! Will be returning next year!!"
Best resort on the Island. The staff was beyond accommodating. The rooms were extremely clean. The restaurants in the resort were 5 stars. The beach access was amazing. Not to mention the resort is located on the best spot on the entire island. We loved the fact we were able to rent golf carts right at the front desk of the resort. And you can't beat 24hr room service. 
We Could not have asked for more! Room was great! Staff is outstanding! Location was very good! Owner on-site! Excellent experience!! All arrangements for golf carts dinners etc were easily taken care of!! We will be back!!
" had, at any resort. The hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was great!  Food-we did not find any food we did not like. The 7 course tasting menu was interesting and quite tasty. There were things we didn't care for, but we knew that beforehand by looking at the menus. Make your reservations when you arrive for whatever days you want. They have the full weeks menus to review. The views from the main restaurant were extraordinary and the breezes we devine. Our absolute favorite breakfast was Frenc"
 team enough for such a great time!!  Until next time Isla… see ya soon !!    ER-
"The food at the restaurant of Posada Lulu (and their smoothies) ,is exceptionally good, also the atmosphere is great, very relaxing.   The rest of the posada could use a little make over, it is indeed rustic and a, bit chaotic. The place has a lot of potential, though.  Onsite they also offer kayak rental and yoga classes, though you have to pay for everything extra.  I did a yoga class, which I can really recommend. It also comes with a view on the lagoon :)"
"Being my first time traveling to Cancun this was the best experience, couldn’t have asked for a better hotel. I absolutely enjoyed my stay with Izla hotel. The staff is amazing and the service as well. Josefina, Luis, Mauricio, Alexis, Claudia and Eduardo did a phenomenal job making us feel like home. Their service is just perfect. I enjoyed every bit of it and I don’t regret it. Foood is delicious. I totally recommend. Would definitely come back!!!!"
"I had my wedding March 19th, 2022 and it was absolutely perfect. We had 3 days of party and Chris the manager was always making sure we were happy and very attentive. He was wonderful to my family and guests. The food was amazing, service, everything! My wedding was 70 people and the hotel managed it perfectly and worked with my mom months before. I will probably go back!"
" where the fort, ATM, and restaurants are located. Overall, I would not recommend staying in this hotel if you can find availability elsewhere."
…
Check in was quick. Room was very spacious but basic. Complimentary shampoo and soap. Coffee and tea available all day with fruits in the morning. Staff were super friendly and helpful. Took a lagoon tour through the hotel at a very reasonable price. Nice relaxation area. Awesome mural .... 8 rooms each depicted with a character ... try and spot which one is missing!
"Location is great, 5 min walk to the lake shores, for boat trip or a walk on the promenade, lots of bar, restaurants and shops nearby, the town's square and the fort, the room is clean, comes with free parking and wifi, Ricardo and his staff are very helpful and friendly, would stay again if back to Bacalar"
"The resort was a great place for our honeymoon. Staff was awesome and very attentive, they work so hard. The island is a fun place to visit. Snorkeling is a must do while you’re here! Only downside we thought was we could hear out in the hallway pretty easily and our room was facing the street and there is a school right across the way. That didn’t ruin our experience at all, but the mornings were a little loud on a couple days. Overall would definitely recommend this resort! "
Great service and great location. Appreciate owner Scott’s personal attention to details and making our stay an excellent one.  Hotel was clean and comfortable. Great bartender who took personal care with every drink. Housekeeping did a great job. Enjoyed the oool area. Suggested dinner and recreational options were all terrific.

"The view at this hostel is amazing, but so are the views all around the lake. The common area at the lake is pretty relaxed and nice, but a bit old.   We had a three person room with a private bathroom. The bathroom was down the hall, the toilet could only flush once every two hours and there was barely any water coming out of the shower. The little mat in front of the shower was old and dirty.   The room was very poorly lit, the airconditioning did not work and the third person had to sleep on a mattress o"
"We spent a lot of time at the pool with my 4yo, Claudia and Saray were excellent servers as were their bartender counterparts Abdulio and Alonzo. Alfredo and josefina were also great in our brief interactions. We also ate frequently at Numo restaurant while there, it was phenomenal food, great wine selection and major kudos to the chef—amazing flavor profiles, presentation and service from Roberto Baak and Rodmin.   The spa staff (Marco) and the nail technicians were also super friendly and knowledgeable. T"
"we stayed at this wonderful resort just one night, but got to enjoy the beach, pools, restaurant,  etc for 2 days!  We checked in at 2pm and left after our 2nd sunset dinner.  They stored the luggage after we checked out.  I loved everything about this place. The food is delicious and healthy. Breakfast was included and we enjoyed breathtaking views. I snorkeled right at the end of their long dock.. and was so surprised to see schools of colorful fish everywhere.   I used their kayak for an exciting ride.  "
The room was clean and nice. The peice is ok to the place.. But the wifi was terrible! It didn't work most of the time.. The location wasnt really good as well. It's not that's close to the center and not so close to the lack. So we always needed a taxi. When we asked the guy from the front dask to order as he send us to look one in the streets! The stuff wasnt nice at all and didn't gave us mach information when we ask.. Actually they send us to really lame places..
"My husband & I ended up in Bacalar for an evening...not planned.  We drove around and looked for a place to lay our heads.  We checked out about 7 places; cabanas, tents, hotels and felt they were overpriced or dirty.  We finally spotted an orange 2 story building and stopped.  After asking prices and showing us a room, we booked ourselves in.  What a lovely hotel for 2 nights.  Super economical, clean and very helpful staff.  The rooms are small but well appointed and there is a nice open lounge where you "
"Appreciated the common refrigerator & ability to wash out clothes & dry them on their clothesline.  Rooms are clean & AC is good.  1st night was terrible in a room in the back as there is a rooster closeby who starts his day at 2am.  Moved to a room in the front which was quiet but had no wifi.  Desk staff was so unhelpful when we asked info about buses because we had no wifi to check schedules.  Breakfast is coffee, bread & fruit."
"I loved my stay at Privilege Aluxes, it was a dream vacation. I stayed in a deluxe suite and opted for the all inclusive plan. Great location, walking distance to the ferry & Hikdalgo. Great staff, beautiful room, I couldn’t ask for anything better. I left 2 weeks ago and already booked my next vacation for next year. I can not wait to go back!"
"When was the last time you felt genuine sadness at checking out of a hotel? Not just end-of-a-vacation sadness but proper this-was-a-one-in-a-million-experience-that-I-may-never-experience-again sadness? For us this was that time. Sure, there are hotels that cost the earth, provide every facility under the sun and pamper you to within an inch of your life. And maybe there’s a place for those kind of hotels. But for me this is everything a hotel should be: small enough to feel like a community, friendly enou"
"This resort is beautifully located on the island of Isla Mujeres, just a short ferry from Cancun.  Although there are only two restaurants on the property, the food is the most delicious we have ever had at an all-inclusive resort! The staff is amazing.  The pools are quiet and relaxing and the beach small but nice.  And although this is a family friendly resort, I saw only 3 children the entire time I was here.  It's a sleepy little resort, not much to do, but if you are looking for a little more adventure"
We loved our stay here! We got the partial ocean view room! It didn't have much of a ocean view but it was new clean and very modern! we faced the smaller quite pool in the back and loved it! The staff were always bice and we can not wait to stay here again! The bar was open and fully stocked when we were there..
 girl at reception and told her we were hungry. Waited for 15 minutes in the restaurant until the reception girl came and told us the chef or whatever was not there so there was no lunch. It feels like the employees were busier enjoying the lake and each other than actually working...
" issue, it was really peaceful and relaxing. The resort is very well maintained. Little or no room to room noise. One tip to put lots of towels down in the bathroom as it is slippery when it gets wet, and kids will need to sit in the shower for the same reason. Overall a great vacation, beautiful relaxing location with kind and skilled hospitality staff."
"Casa de los Suenos offered us an excellent location for our short visit to Isla Mujeres. Folks of all ages, including many Mexican families, were there during our stay. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable though not fancy. Restaurant was very good, with delicious and generous breakfasts included in the room price. The swimming area was as lovely and shallow; the water was a glorious turquoise color and it is shallow enough for kids to swim and even learn to snorkel or kayak. Service was great—supe"
"Glad we found this place and we will be back!  We had booked an airbnb that we were not happy with.  We went for breakfast after one night at the airbnb to regroup and revise our travel plans. We walked around the main plaza and visited the info center there to ask about nearby hotels. While Hotel Szapot was not suggested, it was just around the corner from one that was and the price was better.  It is just one block from the Zocalo and was very comfortable.  The beds were good, and everything worked includ"
"This hotel have an excellent location! You can easily walk from the hotel to visit the city. It is even close to the ADO bus station(10-15 mins walk). There is many restaurants around the hotel. The hotel is also very clean (the room and the courtyard). During the night, we heard nothing, it was quiet. They offer coffee all day long, but our first feeling was that the coffe wasn't fresh, so we don't tasted it.. The receptionist spoke only spanish (but they answered in english at my email, so someone speak e"
"We have been to Privilege Aluxes 12 times and already have number 13 reserved.  There are a lot of repeat customers that visit PA.  Great place, great value but most importantly the people that work there are the very best and make up 90% of the reason there are so many repeat customers. "
" little richer for knowing him. He looks after his staff and he looks after you.  We need more Scotts in the world. Suffice it to say, this is a little slice of paradise and I can’t remember a happier family holiday. Booking Hotel Secreto will be the best decision you make on your Mexican vacation. Treat them well because they’ll be treating you like old friends."

"We loved this location and hotel so much!   It’s located a block away from everything in Isla… it is just a few blocks away from the main strip too. Grocery store within walking distance.. tons of restaurants and souvenirs too. There are also plenty of scuba shops for those interested in arranging Adventure trips or scuba diving.  Hotel can rent you a golf cart to roam the island, for 24 hrs at  $60USD per day… cash only.  Everything from check in to check out was perfect. The peace and tranquility of this "

"Kin-Ha hotel or Casa de los Sueños beats the surroundings in Punta Sur, Isla Mujeres!  We had a great view of those turquoise waters from our porch.  Small and serenity hotel with beautiful Mexican colorful decorations.  Clean amenities and friendly staff.  The Kin-Ha restaurant and all the water sports and amenities are great.  You can easily enjoy all day on site! "
The place is located in the center of everything within a walking distance to the lake. The personnel was really friendly and helpful. The rooms are modest but clean and comfortable. There is a roster in the morning singing.
"We love this hotel and our stay! The food is fantastic, service is great and location is perfect (only a five minute walk to the ferry, and beautiful beaches right here). Definitely recommend staying here if you plan to stay on Isla Mujeres. Jaime at the front desk and Samuel at the pool bar are great!"

"Very small room with no equipments, noisy environment, the bar is closed at 16h and the staff does not offer a glass of water at arrival... a very bad experience with a significant price. A real disaster. Much better offer in Bacalar, which remais a great place to visit."
"This was our first real vacation in three years.  We stayed for 7 nights and did the half board meal plan. The resort was closed for a year and just reopened in December.  That being said except for a few minor service issues everything was spectacular.  The breakfast buffet was pretty elaborate and had something for everyone. Gimer, the manager took great care of us.  We had dinner at NUMA, the more formal restaurant pretty much every night since dinner was included in our plan. Roberto Baak, the head wait"
"We had the pleasure of staying at Casa de los Suenos for 5 nights in February 2022. The views are stunning, the rooms were very comfortable, and the staff were very kind and helpful.  The included breakfast at Kin Ha was fantastic. Loved the Chilaquiles.  The hotel is located on the southern end of the island, so renting a golf kart was a great way to explore the whole island.  Highly recomended. Can't wait to go back."
We had a great stay at Szapot. The room was clean and spacious and the hotel lays just one block away from the central square. The staff helped us with figuring out the bus connections and we were able to check out later. Very much value for our money!
"Staying at Privilege Aluxes is nothing short of a dream, one that is made even more incredible by the wonderful Samuel on poolside. Attentive and lovely doesn’t even close to doing him justice! All of the staff are incredible. The service is world class and you’ll be made to feel like royalty every day!"
"4 stays in the last year. The wife and I love this small hotel.  From its perfect location, the wonderful staff and the great rooms.  The owner Scott and his crew go out of their way to make your stay a great memory.  The location is so quiet but only a very short walk to the everything you will want, from North Beach and all the beach clubs to many, many restaurants, bars and shopping.   "
A lovely relaxing stay.  The major positives -   - 10/10 food. Wide enough choice to keep you interested over 10 days. - Really friendly staff (special mention to the lads working the drinks at the pool) - Amazing views - seriously amazing  Would I come again. Yes.   A few minor negatives.  - yes it needs a bit of TLC  - a couple more pool umbrellas  Other than that it’s a quality place .  Thanks to all the staff that made us very welcome.
"The breakfast was amazing - perfect upon my gusto - overnight oats with lots of seeds topped with fruits, cacao nibs and amaranth puffs wow! For ""lunch"" I had the cacao smoothie!! Simply amazing - it's almost an ice cream - so I spooned the cacao wonder. It was nice to stay there over night, just really hot inside the rooms."
" staff post COVID so just be understanding of that. They go over the top to correct any service issues.  The chef was top notch.  For example the catch of the day came with patty pan squash, candy cane beets and mini stemmed carrots which was an unexpected delight.  Amazing quality and freshness.  It was worth the $40pp per day to include breakfast and  dinner.  The tip is also included in the price.  (Best deal we found was on booking.com) They will also let you switch from dinner to lunch if you want to t"
"Let me first start off by saying we are experienced PA'ers and have been here multiple times. I see in other reviews how 'rude' some of the servers/workers might be.  First, I would say, that in my experience (getting ready to book my fourth trip to PA) that the staff here deals with a LOT of contentious guest.    During our last trip in early May, there was a huge family of Americans from an undisclosed state who behaved in such a way that I was EMBARASSED they represented the country I came from and fough"
"We stayed at Posada Lulu for three nights in December of 2018, and felt kind of tricked. There are beautiful photos online, but no mention on the website or after booking to say that the area in front of the water and around the hostel is undergoing major construction.   This means from 10 am - 5 pm every day, we listened to shrieking bandsaws and loud hammering rather than the waves of the lake - not exactly the tranquility we were looking for. It was nice to sit by the water but the area itself was also s"

" and not understanding them, making incredibly rude remarks to other guests, being excessively loud IN ALL CASES (Restaurants, Beaches, Pool area). . . It was awful to watch.  We shared the resort for an entire week with them and attempted to avoid their vicinity at all costs!  Eww.  Seeing this made me realize… WE are coming to THEIR home expecting them to feed us American Cuisine and speak OUR language.  I say… WE should learn THEIR language and start treating THEM with the same respect we expect from the"
" three days.   Positives: the food at the resturaunt was good and the staff there were friendly. The tranquility of the lake when there was no construction, and the French couple working there were very very friendly and lovely! However, we still left feeling tricked by false advertising. Perhaps a reduced rate during construction or at least a warning upon booking would be more fair."

Private access to the lake Only 3 rooms Very friendly service Offering coffee and tea  Beautiful setting. You will have a quiet private access the whole day. Unforgettable   A really hidden gem And great price  Go for it!!!
Gracias a todo el equipo del Che en especial a Mati por la buena onda el buen trato y toda la experiencia en sí ! Todos los dias fueron muy divertidos y bonitos! Me llevo un buen recuerdo! Sin duda lo recomiendo para proximos viajeros que quieran una estancia agradable y activa!

"***BE WARNED*** THIS HOTEL IS NOT AS ADVERTISED AND IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MUCH BETTER OPTIONS IN BACALAR.   The photos suggest it by the lake, it is not. Then if you look on the website it says ""100 meters away from the Bacalar Lagoon"", it's actually a 10min walk to the nearest entrance to the lake.   You can't even view the lake from the hotel as other hotels are in the way. There is no pool either.   It is far more expensive than much better options on the lake, you're wasting your money and time if "
"Bacalar is beautiful  We spent one week there with our baby girl. A week there felt quite long. It was thunder season so the lacuna was not very nice, more moddie:) a lot of mennonites to see there. They live close by. Quiet village !   We loved the apartment. Especially the service. We had water that the staff refilled every 2 days, cleaning whenever we wanted the apartment to be cleaned. They were really warming  It was our daughters first birthday and the staff decorated our apartment for our girl 🥰🥰 tha"
"This hotel looks like in front of lake when I check the photos but it is not. Front office clerk doesn’t speak English. Location is bad, it’s so close to highway and you can see all cars going. There are lots of hotels for the cheapest price in the center cause it’s super expensive when you compare what you have at the hotel. Even there is no water in the room and you have to go back to lobby to refill your water bottle. Also dogs can wake you up around like 4 am they are all barking in the hotel hallway.  "
"Bacalar was possibly my favourite place we visited and pleased we chose this hotel. We booked a private room with shared bathroom and were pleased to find we had a large room on the ground floor of the hotel. The shared bathroom was fine and never had an issue of waiting to be able to use.  We never did get to use the included breakfast, we made it upstairs in time on our first day but couldn't understand the set up as nothing was out and no staff in sight to speak to; perhaps something which needs to be be"
"Estuve alojada 1 noche y lo elegi por el precio y la ubicación. Tiene mulle sobre la laguna, aunq está muy ocupado con lanchas con las que salen las excursiones. No ofrece desayuno, pero tiene un quiosquito para nada caro y tiene un bar.  La cabaña es muy muy básica y habia cucarachas. Pero está muy bien ubicada como para ir al centrito/plaza, donde está el fuerte, los barcitos/restó y negocios para salir. Enfrente mismo hay un comedor y un quiosco."
"I was happy with this hotel, for the price and the location it was great. It is not perfect , but for me was great , I will stay in this hotel again. For solo travelers it is nice because it is in front of the plaza and they have a small fair every night"
"I do not recommend this hostal/hotel.  This hostal does not announce clear enough that you should expect a shared bathroom. They also have one of the hardest beds I have ever tried to sleep in.

"Tres bonne salade de crevettes pour 165 pesos, cocktail à 90 pesos.Tres bon accueil avec un repas au bord de la lagune. Le restaurants proposent d'autres services comme un tour de bateau sur la lagune et des chambres mais nous n'avons pas essayé."
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. The location is so central and the room we stayed at was very pleasant. Great value for money and a great base to explore the lagoon! Very friendly receptionist and staff too.

"We were dubious because of the name and it being a hostal, but we got a villa which was spacious and clean, had a large fridge and full kitchen. The bathroom was very nice, not great water pressure though. It’s location is unbeatable, though not on the water, it’s a short walk to various docks. The reception staff was above and beyond accommodating and friendly. They helped us print boarding passes, schedule a sailboat tour, find kayaks and call taxis. The air conditioning worked fine, and the suite called "

"I booked 7 nights here through booking.com The cost was shown as 379€. I immediately started to get emails from them demanding 50% deposit via Paypal. I voiced my concerns with them about this and after much correspondence, agreed to pay 100€ deposit and the rest on arrival. I then get a request for a payment of almost 240€ through paypal from them! They said they would only accept 50% up front... I asked how they'd managed to add 100€ to the bill and they said it was 19% of the original fee on top... which"
"Mi amiga Romina y yo buscábamos un lugar tranquilo donde comenzar a disfrutar de nuestras vacaciones en la península de Yucatán y fuimos a parar al Cayuco Maya en nuestros primeros días, siguiendo la recomendación de un amigo mejocano por su buena relación entre calidad y precio.

" quieran desplazarse. El último día de nuestra estancia pudimos disfrutar de una bonita excursión en kayac por los manglares que hay al otro lado de la laguna.  Recomendamos muchísimo este lugar a aquellas personas que busquen una experiencia única, rodeados de bonitos paisajes y bellas personas."
…
Room smelled too the point I woke up twice from the smell on the middle of the night.  No pressure in the shower. Water was hot then cold then hot again then cold again. Charged me 16$ over my reservation quote.  Would not take credit cards probably so you can't request a refund.  And finally for what we paid it was a terrible value.  This was Cheap hotel room with the price of a boutique hotel room.   Avoid this place.
"Un lugar muy tranquilo, con la ventaja de aceptar perros. Nos quedamos en un domo geodésico que se ve muy padre y moderno, aunque la decoración y detalles por dentro son muy rústicos (no del modo bonito) y hasta con acabados mal hechos; lo bueno es que tiene baño privado y aire acondicionado, y el precio fue muy razonable. Incluyeron desayuno (casero, riquísimo y hecho al momento) y el uso de kayaks. La carta de comida sí es algo limitada pero el sazón es buenísimo y los precios económicos. La atención muy "

Aceptan mascotas lo cual es un completo plus para el lugar, no está cerca del pueblo lo cual lo hace más privado, tiene su restaurante para desayuno y almuerzo y es hermoso.

"El lugar es muy bonito y tranquilo. Sin embargo,  la habitación era espantosa,  con mucha humedad en las paredes y el baño intocable.  Lastima,  porque el lugar vale la pena.  La comida es buena aunque el menú sumamente limitado.  Te atienden de medio mala gana y no limpian la habitación ni un solo día.  "
"Hicimos una reservación directamente con ellos desde el miércoles pasado. Cuando llegamos ahí el lugar estaba muy bien, algo rústico ya que la cocina es a la leña y cacharros de barro.  Al principio me preocupe por qué no nos tomaron ni la temperatura, o gel. Por lo que mi familia iba preparada con todo el kit u siempre cuidando la sana distancia.  Cuando hicimos check in.

Pues les regreso su dinero.  De toda la experiencia que iba bien, por qué ya aparte estábamos consumiendo bien, éramos nueve personas respetando todas las normas para que solo nos dijeran eso.  L"
"The rooms are ok. They are clean but the things are old. The shower is terrible. The garden is nice, pool is clean. It's close to the beach (if you have a car) they also have a private parking lot. They offered Breakfast but the service is soooo bad, we woke up at 9 am for breakfast and they didn't  even have coffee when we got to the dinning area. When we ask the lady for coffees she gave us a bad look. If you have a big group you're probably are gonna wait hours for your breakfast. Definitely they need to"
"We stayed for 1 night in July 2016. We ended up in the suite because it was all that was showing on booking.com, but when we arrived the hotel was completely empty. This was annoying as we were paying a more expensive price.   The hotel is on the opposite side of the highway to the lake and town so you need a car.   The hotel was not quiet in the evening, there was some sort of music banging until the early hours.   The suite was very nice, it was large, clean, there was hot and cold water and a spa bath. T"
"Wir haben 1 Nacht im Poza Clara verbracht. Wir haben ein Apartment bekommen mit einer kleinen Küche. Das Zimmer war sauber und das Personal freundlich. Das Frühstück bestand aus Kaffee, Früchten, Saft und wahlweise einer frisch gebackenen Zimtschnecke oder Muffin. Das beste Gebäck, was wir in Mexiko hatten."
" place. This was especially annoying as we could not even use the pool as it was also being cleaned. Even when the pool had been cleaned it was still dirty to we got out almost as soon as we got in.   Wifi was good. One of the staff didn't seem to care very much about these issues, the lady who spoke English was nice.   Overall, a waste of money!  "
…
Poza Clara is a beautiful small hotel perfectly located in Bacalar with only a few blocks from the main square and a couple of blocks to the lagoon. The rooms are beautiful and very clean and the surroundings of the hotel has lots of greenery which created a very calm feeling. When we stayed there were only one other couple except us at the hotel so we had the pool to ourselves and it felt very private and intimate. We would definitely go and stay there again if we go back to Bacalar.We have an 8 month old 
"This should be a quiet, charming garden oasis. It isn't. We had the King bungalow with spa bath for three nights. First night, no hot water. Never enough water pressure to use the spa, anyway. Paying extra for the bungalow was a waste of money. The bungalow smelled terribly musty with mildew on the lower walls. Maid service was almost non-existent. I finally had to go to reception and ask for our room to be cleaned on the third day. The maid replaced the towels and made the bed without changing the sheets. "
 the hotel showed us great hospitality. I only have good things to say about Poza Clara!
"Bacalar scheint eine aufstrebende Stadt zu sein: überall wird für den Tourismus gebaut. Das Hotel ist fertig, liegt aber aktuell noch in einem Baugebiet, das den Gesamteindruck des Hotels leider trübt. Hinter dem Pool (den man nun benutzen kann) hängen schwarze Plastikplanen zum Nachbargrundstück.  Das Zimmer #1 war sauber und klein. Die Klimaanlage war kräftig, wurde aber tagsüber von den Reinigungskräften ausgeschaltet. Ärgerlich ;-)  Zu den Restaurants und den „Highlights“ der Stadt konnte man gut zu Fuß"
" bekommen (lecker!!)  Das Personal war sehr freundlich!  Auf dem Dach der Rezeption befanden sich Hängestühle und Hängematten. Sehr geeignet, um mit einem Cocktail in der Hand den Abend ausklingen zu lassen."
I gave two stars instead of one because we were happy we could stay here for one night with a super late arrival. But this place is so new there is nothing around. Its more like a motel... breakfast is horrible: toast and butter and jam. COME ON!  The rooms are really small and pretend to be in Scandinavia but it’s really not working. Stay closer to town or the Laguna; as we did the other nights we were in Bacalar. It’s better and cheaper. 
"This might seem as a harsh review, but this is as honest and objective as can be. On pictures this place looks lovely, but that’s not case. The rooms are incredibly small, absolutely no space for 2 people. I have not even seen rooms in the center of Amsterdam or London this small. This is my 9th hotel travelling through mexico and I am already used to the fact that the Mexican hotels cannot be compared with the European standard, but this is bad even for Mexican standards. Drywall walls, so you can hear eve"
" you have to climb over each other if you have to use the toilet. The shower really has no water pressure, which is not always good throughout Mexico, but I have never experienced the water pressure this bad, not even in Asia. Also the worst wifi we had in all Mexico. Plus no good areas to sit outside, uncomfortable wooden chairs, and half the place is still under construction. A lot of stray dogs and cats all over the property, also barking and whining all night long. Breakfast is a couple of days old toas"
There was a mix up with my reservation and the owner was outrageously rude and aggressive. I used booking.com to make a reservation. When I tried to pay I was told that I should pay at the hotel. I arrived at the hotel and at reception was a very nice woman who spoke NO English. I tried to pay but was told that the internet was down. She showed me to my room. I made the assumption I would pay when the internet was working. I went to bed around 1 a.m. Shortly after someone knocks on my door. I opened it and

"This hotel was perfect for our stay in Bacalar - clean, fresh and a great quiet atmosphere. The pool was amazing and we swam until 8pm most nights. Rooms are cleaned daily and are generous size and very very comfortable. Couldn’t ask for anything more. We loved our stay and would highly recommend. "
" average American tourist doesn’t go to Mexico to squat in mediocre hotel rooms in iffy locations, this man just became more aggressive and used no reason. There really is no need to give more details. Just avoid this place. The owner displayed a volatility that was very disconcerting, particularly in the middle of the night with his squad standing behind him. Crazy stuff. TERRIBLE experience. I almost left Bacalar the next day because of it."
"We arrived pretty late and left really early 5:30am and in both times la señora Ofelia was really sweet and attentive to wait for us to open the door. It’s a humble little hotel, it’s not a luxurios place but that’s exacty what it is being offered and the price is accordingly cheap. There are 3 really cute and friendly dogs that greet you when you arrive. For the price we paid, excellent service. Very much worth it if you are looking to save some money on your trip"
"Nous avons séjourné à 4 pendant 2 nuits dans cet hôtel. L’hôtel est à 10min à pied de la lagune et 15 du centre. Globalement c’est un excellent séjour, cet hôtel a un excellent rapport qualité prix, il n’y a rien à dire !   Points positifs:  - excellent accueil. La dame nous ayant accueillis était aux petits soins, attentionnée et disponible pour ses clients.  - flexible. Nous sommes arrivés en avance par rapport à l’heure prévue, la chambre était prête et cela n’a posé aucun problème. De plus, la dame nous"

"Great place to stay. The staff is incredibly helpful. We spent an amazing weekend. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and really nice. The staff is super helpful. All their recommendations and tours were spot on!"
"Жалею, что провели здесь так мало времени. Прекрасные комнаты и ремонт, чудесная терраса с качелями и грилем, розетки с входами usb без необходимости в переходниках, своя стоянка и другие приятные мелочи. Жаль разве что кафе нет для позднего ужина или завтрака.  Из-за неучтенной разницы во времени по штатам опоздали на заселение на час, но нас дождались без каких-либо штрафов. Очень рекомендую! "
"Casa posada was great.  The staff is very kind and accommodating. (You just have to be patient.  Enjoy meeting people.)  You have the choice using a bed and adding a hammock inside the room for a few more bucks.  The location is simply four blocks away from the main plaza.  It is quiet and away from most of the noise.  I even enjoyed listening to all the birds in the peaceful early morning.  There's free coffee in the reception.  Parking was free, safe and secure inside the hotel.  We decided to walk everyw"

Rien de dramatique encore une fois, l’hôtel répond rapidement par whatsapp si besoin.  - un petit peu excentré. Nous n’avons pas senti d’insécurité dans la ville de Bacalar mais puisque les alentours de l’hôtel sont peu fréquentés et sans beaucoup d’éclairage public, il est peut être préférable de rentrer à plusieurs la nuit ou alors en taxi.

"A small and very personal hotel. Created by, and run with, pure passion by the owner Alex and his wonderful team. The rooms are basic, but clean and fresh. The location is ok, but still not far from the city center or the lagoon. But it's the service that stands out. Living here is like having a family (or good friends) in Bacalar. Can truly recommend this place and I hope to be back someday."
"This hotel, although modern in design and comfortable beds, had totally filthy cement floors throughout the room, complete with spilled food stains and random hair.  The steps etc were also very dirty.  It needed a total hose down. We did our best to mop ourselves and wore our flip flops inside.  We have stayed on a lot of hotels in this $ range this trip but all were clean.  I mentioned it, kindly, to housekeeping the next day and she improved it slightly.  Horrible.  I don't recommend."
"We were instantly happy when we arrived at the house: very beautiful, spotlessly clean and it even looked brand new. The room is very spacious and it had the best shower we’ve found yet in Yucatán. There is no airco, but the fan works very well and we slept very well. The house is nearby the big road from Bacalar to Tulum, but it wasn’t noisy at all actually. For us it was nice to be out of the centre, but when you don’t have your own car it’s maybe a tad more difficult (although they rent bikes and the cen"
" super thankful to him for helping us out when we locked ourselves out of our car. He went to search the locksmith on his bike and came to find us to translate everything in Spanish. If that isn’t outstanding hospitality, I don’t’ think it exists anymore :) thanks for your kindness and for the great stay Luis! Definitely recommend this place!"
" remodeling taking place when my family arrived, but it was not an inconvenience.  Clean, cool, roomy , WIFI and with good TV.  I would return again."
"We had a great time. The owner couple were very cordial and made sure we were comfortable in the room and had coffee and a microwave outside in a common area. Rooms were spotless, big, comfortable and AC was great. Wifi not real fast but worked for the cheap price. Definitely will stay again. Great restaurant one street behind them. Suculenta, recommended by owner, and they did have great service by Ramses Leal,  and the chef, Jose, is an excellent cook. We ate most meals there over 3 nites. "

"The rooms are spacious and bright and new. The aircon and ceiling fan worked perfectly and there was always hot water. There is a shaded terrace on the 2nd floor which is nice to hang out at. We used the bicycles one day to explore Bacalar, though Casa Madrid is close enough to walk to everything.  The hostess/owner was so very kind and thoughtful. We enjoyed our stay very much and even extended it.  This is not a fancy waterfront hotel, but those charge at least twice the rate as Casa Madrid.  Before stayi"
"Overal it was OK.T he location is good and the host family is very nice as wel, but they can't speak any ENGLISH. The rooms are really simple and not very cozy.In our rooms the wifi barely works and there is a chemical smell which didn't leave even after opening windows etc."
"The rooms have a very old smell. There also is no airconditioning so please take that into account. The personel also does not speak any English, and they make you charge quite a lot for very small things (like instant coffee). Furthermore, the WiFi signal is very poor. For what its worth, the place is quite cheap and if you do not mind walking 10 minutes to the city centre, you´re good."
"For sure you will be paying only for the location, we rented a 4 person room with private bathroom, A/C took forever to work, the place is dirty, the room was full of ants and spiderwebs, looks like they never clean after use. It is too expensive for what really is. Restaurant bar Service ends at 8pm. Too far from downtown bacalar, if you don't have a car, forget about it."
"Was really happy with location , cleanliness and value for money , staff were helpful when you asked for info , looks like they're building more rooms too. Would definitely stay again and we loved Bacalar . "
"Had a wonderful stay at Delmar camping thanks to him being such a wonderful host. The breakfast was fantastic and he was extremely helpful with directions and tips for seeing the lagoon. The property has only recently been opened so there are a few small issues which are continually being addressed, the room was better by the end of our stay. Would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a budget option in bacalar. We were a couple staying in the ensuite double room. Raleigh and Izzy"
"The place is very nice. Especially when the sun shines & you see the lake. Before booking we saw pictures on thr internet so we wanted a room with lake view. Once we got there, we got a room without lake view. Nobody there spoke English, so we made a phonecall to someone who did. The guy told us that we could see the lake as long as we opened te window & looked outside. We said that it's strange that ""lake view"" means that you have to stick out your head out of the window to see a lake. He coulen't do more "
"Nice rooms with t.v. and air-con, hot water, windows are screened for mosquitos. nice staff, very helpful. You can hang a hammock outside on the veranda and it has deck chairs. T.v. has a few english channels. They let us do some hand washing in the lavandaria as well which was nice. My only complaint is the double bed is hard and small for a couple."
" do anything to compromise.... The walls aren't even really walls. Just sticks made out of wood. If you stood closely you could look outside.  So... the place is good, but the service was not!"
"Being on a budget and without a car, I needed a reasonable place to stay and near town and the restaurants; Posada Casa Madrid was perfect. It was close to the bus terminal and 5 minutes walk to the center of town. The room is simple but nice and I loved the fact that they cleaned my room EVERY DAY! I loved coming back after a day of swimming to find clean, white sheets on my bed. Bacalar is such a wonderful place!"

"This is not a hotel, more like a glorified hostel.There is very little privacy and the rooms are tiny, which would be fine if there was a nice outdoor space but that is not the case. There is no shade and the yard has only a small plastic pool that is very slippery and three hammocks which are ripped and mildewed and just gross. Its obvious that this is merely a money making operation as the owners seem to do the bare minimum. Half of the rooms are under construction and it seems that they could care less a"
"Stayed here for two nights and I am a little confused by the negative reviews, the owner was charming and spoke good english. There is definitely aircon that can get as cold as you want. I felt like I was back in England!   I was staying with a friend and we had a room with two double beds, it was big with a decent enough shower with hot water.   It is only a 5 minute walk to the main square and a 10 minute walk to the laguna. There are bikes also available for hire for a reasonable fee if you dont want to "
"This camping is simple and it has all you need to enjoy the Bacalar Lagoon and have a good staying, but expect to pay for its great location at the lagoon. Bacalar town is 10 minutes driving.  My family ( husband and 4 year kid ) stayed 3 nights at this camping. We paid for a room with AC. The room is simple but the WC and shower were outside. The WC supposed to be private, but it was also used by other people, I suspect, and it didn’t get cleaned everyday :-(.  The personnel attention is below the standard"
"Stayed at yaxche in town and I had the receptionist call to reserve a tent. On arrival no reservation but they did have an available tent for rent. 3 very bad camping pads made it feel like I was sleeping on the ground. No prices posted anywhere, managers couldn't care less about service, on going construction and what really pissed me off NO pillows, sheets or blankets for our 2 night stay. The only thing this place has going for it is the lagoon. Bring your own camping supplies or just avoid, didn't stay "
"Everything is close and very safe , staff friendly and they have good recommendations, I did the sailing tour !! Wow Amazing!!! The price is really good and it’s perfect for everyone , I enjoyed Bacalar"
"After a last minute cancellation, we needed a place to stay and very few places were available. I was reluctant to stay at Casa Delia given reviews I’ve read but was pleasantly surprised. The room itself was small but clean, comfortable and well decorated.  The aircon worked well and it was quiet enough to sleep. The towels did have stains and holes.    The location is a bit of walk from the main town but most places in Bacalar are. "
"This was the only bad experience i had in Mexico.  They are like 2 miles from the main road, the entrance road to this place looks public, i drove all the way to the place, i check the rooms, very dirty, small, expensive and with share bathrooms, you have to walk like 20 metters to the bathrooms . So i talked to my family and decide not to stay for all that and because is very far away from down town. we drove out of the place and there was a gate closed, so we started talking to some local people there and"

"Buenas fotos y lugar EXTERIOR, pero las habitaciones son SIN VENTANAS, extremadamente pequeñas  NO TIENE WIFI,solamente en el exterior y sucio,  no hicieron la habitación toallas mojadas,porque nadamos en la piscina  pero NO LAS CAMBIARON. El espacio minúsculo para dormir.Si sufres de claustrofobia, por favor NO VAYAS!!! ESTE HOTEL CAMBIA DE NOMBRE CONSTANTEMENTE."
"The prívate jetty and hammocks and swings on the lagoon makes this hotel so amazing. The room is comfy, nothing fancy. Staff were so friendly. Could also Rent out kayaks there , hotel located on a beautiful part of the lagoon"
"Won't go there ever. The room was rather small for a 3-guest room. Was not possible to fit in the bathroom unless the door was closed (small like a closet,  2m² max), and you couldn't even open the door entirely because the toilets were on the way. Worse, the french window couldn't be locked ! The room was on the ground floor, so basicly, anyone could enter the room.  Fan was not working properly.  There was no blanket, although it was cold at night and the staff would try to find a solution.  We were suppo"

"The pictures do not show the reality: there is no lake view at all! Owner / manager does not care whatsoever. Room was not clean, bed sheets were in a poor state. Aircon could only be used if we paid US $50 for one night!!"
"Biggest nightmare and something you don't éver want to deal with on a vacation. My biggest mistake is also booking via Agoda who books through Booking.com (which I was not aware of till this incident happened) On Agoda it has 9.6 rating that's why I chose this particular hotel. I booked 3 nights and we had a long journey getting to Bacalar. We were super tired by the time we arrived. When we walked up to the front desk, I had an instinct this place is not what the pictures had shown so I asked to check for "
" and paid the 3 nights as what we originally planned for. When we were in the room, we noticed there were dead bugs stuck to the bottom frame of the screen protectors of the floor to ceiling glass doors that leads to the balcony. The mosquito screen protectors were broken & we can't leave the sliding doors open for fear of mosquitoes entering the room. For the price we paid $85 per night, we were not entitled to have AC just fan which is fine. But now without fresh air, it is a bit annoying.  This room basi"

"My boyfriend and I stayed on the ground level. Our room and bathroom were dirty, the door of the bathroom didn’t close, the fan made a buzzing sound, mattress and pillows were uncomfortable and the room’s doorlock was jammed so at times it wouldn’t lock properly. On top of that the receptionist was unfriendly and didn’t care about the issues I reported. The pier is nice, good hammocks and chairs with amazing view. Way overpriced for what they offer, you can find better hotels with just as good or better lak"
"This kind of “eco hotel” that eants to be eco friendly has nothing to offer.  We booked by “Booking” and pictures and descriptions looked good, but nothing is true. Rooms tiny, beside reception and you can hear the reception guy when you are in your bed.  It smell very bad, the bathroom was small too.  Don’t waist your money, because is a very cheap place and they charge you like a decent place."
"We have booked the most expensive room in this hotel but it is also terrible, although we have a balcony, Here are some points you can consider if you are planning to stay in this hotel, ++++Advantage+++++++ +staffs are helpful, attitude of reception are good. Few staffs can understand /speak English. +close to the lake. +Good security, I can see cameras on the corridors and dock areas. ——-Disadvantage ———— -Advertisement does not match the reality. -The room did not even have a quilt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you ne"

"Me and my girlfriend stayed for to nights at this hotel. We booked for three and asked the receptionist, if it is possible to stay for two nights. He said it is possible we just had to cancel the booking of your internetplatform and pay in cash. He promised that we wouldn’t pay twice. After a few days we were charged at our creditcard for the three nights we initially booked. It took over 3 weeks and many messages to get parts of the money back. Only one guy speaks English at this hotel. So it is very diffi"

"Does not look like the photos at all, room is dark,  damp  shower had a trickle of water, door handle came right off on the door to the washroom, so you couldn’t close the door on the inside. the hammocks you see are not for guests , in fact they are used by staff or locals .  Our room was right near hammocks. The bar was used by staff drinking , smoking, talking until 2:00 am, we tried to call the manager but no answer, messaged him instead through booking.com and he says there is no problem.

"This is the worst hotel I have visited in my life. As a neighbor, the hotel has a disco: it is guaranteed that you will not be able to sleep at night No doubt: you will sleep better in any other hotel in the city In addition, the showers do not work: the water debit (hot or cold) is so slow that it is impossible to use."
"This place is not for you if you value privacy.  There is only a privacy wall between the bed and toilet, so unless you like doing your business in the same room as your travel companion, it's not great.  The rooms are basically a glass box with billowing white curtains, so we felt quite exposed, even with them closed.  It's the smallest double bed ever.  I travelled with a girlfriend so we naturally hug the edge of the bed when we have to share, but in this bed, we were still crashing into each other.  The"

"...that we have read other reviews just when we were there!  In fact we have experience the same of many others: a place that it's absolutely outpriced for the experience it offers to Customers.  The manager (Leo) is trying to keep things together, but the whole staff is just a disaster. They are simply uncapable (kitchen is really unacceptable), unwilling (nobody speaks 1 word of English, but even using our Spanish-Italian they neither try) and some even impolite (reception lady should simply not work in c"

"Pasamos dos noches junto a otra pareja y la verdad que por la ubicación fue perfecto ya que estaba justo al lado de la plaza principal. Las instalaciones están muy descuidadas y un poco sucias. Si lo cuidasen bien estaría súper bonito. Las habitaciones cómodas, el personal amable, les pedimos algunos utensilios que necesitamos y nos los dieron. Nos faltó cocina."

This review is based on the room that I had as there are various types. The room was small but nice decor. Nowhere to really put your stuff but ok for one night. I put very good but it’s good and above average.  The breakfast that was included was good.  Ask for a room on lower floor as the top is a palapa. Make sure you have mosquito repellent if you are on the balcony or lobby area at night. Friendly staff. I found the rate quite high but I did not choose it. They have a pool as well.
"Pas de parking privé. Emplacement très mal signalé. Draps sales et locaux très vétuste. Accueil moyen. Espace commun fermé,  travaux dans le jardin juste fermé par un rideaux. Très bien situé dans bacalar. Prix excessif pour le service donné. Nous ne sommes restés qu'une seule nuit. Rien à voir avec les photos."
"El internet no funciono en ningún momento, hoy en día es un servicio importante para el cliente. Bajamos a desayunar 9:20am y el desayuno en teoría es hasta las 10, y ya no había muchas cosas, entre ellas leche. Preguntamos a la recepcionista y su respuesta fue que “eso era lo que había”.  El lugar es lindo pero el servicio al cliente pésimo, al menos de parte de la recepcionista. Más amable fue una chica de limpieza.   No lo recomiendo."
"El hotel esta feo, descuidado, sucio, no se parece a las fotos. La alberca descuidada y muy pequeña, no sirvió el agua caliente, tampoco sirvió la televisión. Sábanas y almohadas muy corrientes. El pdesayuno está bien, la fruta esta bien servida con yoghurt y granola, café o té y pan tostado con mermelada. Pero en la tarde no hay nada que comer.  La vista esta bien pero no hay mucho que hacer en familia en el hotel. La atención también deja mucho que desear. No vale el Costo."
"Buena relación precio-calidad. La habitación limpia y los servicios funcionan. El staff? 10/10 Super amables y atentos. Desde el encargado al llegar, el guardia que estaba de noche y las chicas en el restaurante del hotel. Hacen falta camastros/sillas en la orilla de la laguna."
"L’hôtel est horrible, les chambres sont vieilles, sales. Il y a des puces dans les lits. Nous avions réservés 3 chambres (toutes dans le même état) Une odeur d’égouts dans toutes les chambres. L’extérieur est en chantier. Sincèrement ne pas venir séjourner ici."

"Es un lugar tranquilo, con una atención linda y humana, estuvimos muy Agusto en el lugar, aunque podría mejorar un poco el mantenimiento, es un lugar pacifico y cómodo. Esperamos regresar pronto, la mejor atención fue de Amairany y nos enamoramos de Almendra una pequeña cachorra que vive alli "
"I came here in may 2021. Very good service, increíble access to the water. I definitely recommend. The food Was good as well.   The color of the water is very pretty, with no seaweed at all. We also had massages by the lagoon. Great experience. 10 out of 10"

L’hôtel est neuf mais les finitions sont bâclées. Pas d’eau chaude ni de poubelle. Un balcon commun est disponible ce qui est un point positif. Lit long size. La famille qui nous a accueilli et très sympa et serviable. Wi-Fi ne fonctionne pas
 which I hate...living out of a suitcase.  Wifi was spotty and they only way to access the menu was to scan a QR Code.  They didn't have even 1 paper copy and I asked the staff if they can show us on their phone.  That was a no.  So we spent the 4 days not knowing what was offered on the menu.  We had to guess what they had to offer.  Fruit was offered at breakfast only.  Period.  The food!  Microwave food.  We ordered eggs and sausage....we got hot dogs for sausage.

Pier hotel Bacalar todo inluido took money from our creditcard 4 months prior to our trip (By the name of bekehotels.com). We have cancelled our trip three weeks ago and we are still waiting for them to transfer the money back. In fact they don’t respond to any message at all
"We were very excited to visit Bacalar during our one month stay in Akumal however booking at Hotel pier Bacalar was a nightmare. We traveled for about 3 hours to its location and as we entered the road to enter the hotel, the bumps nearly damaged the under carriage of the car and as we entered the lobby ""which is outdoors"" mosquitos were waiting big time. Before they actually checked us in, I asked if we could see the property / room. The room was disgusting, curtains dirty, stained..smelled terrible etc. S"
" céntrico, pero el costo y las instalaciones horribles!!! BASTANTE CARO PARA LO DEFICIENTE QUE TERMINA SIENDO... Definitivamente los invito a buscar más opciones de hospedaje"
 Akumal. This ruined our day! Thanks Hotel Bacalar
"Je suis navré de mettre cette mauvaise cote car le responsable sur place est très sympathique et serviable. Cependant, les points faibles concernant le logement sont: Forte odeur d'humidité surtout dans la salle de bains, logement bruyant car le chien d'à côté ne cesse d'aboyer, difficile d'avoir de l'eau chaude dans la douche. Logement assez basic. Les espaces communs sont peu confortables et quasi inexistants. Pas de parking pour voitures."
"After reading other reviews about subpar food, I must say we could not disagree more. The food was excellent. We ordered the ceviche every day. Beautiful resort, tentative staff, clean rooms. Booked a private sail tour of the Lagoon through front desk. Super easy and they pick you up right at the dock. Loved our stay."

"A chance stop-over in Bacalar ended up with us spending a night at this hotel. The personnel is kind and friendly. And professional, not trying to be your buddies with the tiresome ""amigo"" schtick; no, here they address you by your name.   Antonio deserves a mention for his being so attentive with the food service and manager Carlos is the epitome of laid back and has a calm ""sure, we can do that"" approach."" to whatever request you might have.   Beds are very comfortable and designers - as well as guests wh"
"Don't do it to yourself.  While the view was spectacular at Wayak, the service was the worst I've had in Mexico and the sofa bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever had the displeasure of lying on (my son slept on the floor).  They had literally 1 and 1/2 oars for the guests to share between six or so kayaks. A/c in room was broken.  The staff were more interested in their mobile phones than the guests, frequently disappeared for long periods, and did not even offer to help carry heavy luggage up s"
" watch the sun come up. Then, take a paddle in a hotel kayak over the 180-meter deep black cenote just around the corner on a lake as still as glass. Perfection.   After that, coffee and a light continental breakfast.to start your day.   Highly recommended, this place!"
"Because of a huge mixup in our reservation, we had to shove fourteen people in two rooms.  The owner compensated by giving us free dinner and beverages which helped the sting of our reality.  Beautiful quiet and secluded place.  However, one must be very sure-footed when walking anywhere on the property because of the very steep inclines and cobblestone-like walkways.  Rooms were clean but not exactly easy to get to.  In our room, there was a large step up to both the kitchen and bathroom and if you didn’t "

"Very lovely hotel.  Build to complement the environment with all natural local materials.  Loved the patio with the hammock.  They have parking right out front, continental breakfast (fruit with yogurt & granola, coffee or tea, toast) you can order eggs or anything else for extra cost which was very good.  Reception & staff all very friendly.  They were always cleaning and maintaining the beautiful gardens, pool and lagoon area.  Very peaceful.  Rooms very spacious & cozy.  Will be back to enjoy this hidden"
"We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Carolina. The staff is so attentive and kind. The front desk was great with recommendations. It is a small boutique hotel which was the perfect authentic feel for the quaint town of Bacalar. It is locally family owned which made us very happy to be supporting. The location of the hotel is ideal, as it is just outside the heart of town. Its a great value and beautiful place."
"I cannot rave enough about this hotel. It is located in front of the lagoon, with a beautiful view over the peer, kayaks for guest use, bar, small restaurant and only 15 rooms in bungalows. It is pristine, well decorated and perfectly comfortable. But above all the esthetics and comfort what makes Carolina outstanding is the staff, from cooks, waitstaff and cleaning crew. The front desk staff is always ready to help, specially Lorena who will joyfully respond to questions, tailor recommendations keenly unde"

"The room is clean and the service good. Breakfast can't be called breakfast. Bicycle rentals are expensive, you can get cheaper from your neighbor. The location of the hotel is good, bike hire in Bacalar is the best way to explore the place."
Beautiful place.  Clean  Fair price  Close to downtown  And they can help you fix tours! Highly recommended  Came for a day only but it would be worth to stay longer  The hotel offers coffe and tea 24 hours. And a continental breakfast from 8 to 10 am
This little gem we found while wandering around the streets of Bacalar. It is clean and close to the action in Bacalar. A quick stroll of 5 minutes takes you the the lagoon. Free parking behind shut gates and a guard/staff member on duty at night.
"Shameful hygiene!  Dirty sheets, no pillow cases, toilets and showers not cleaned during our three days of stays.  Even the breakfast is dirty, with flies and hairs in the jam.  The staff is even more deplorable: no smiles during the stay but nervous to the point of yelling at customers when they do not understand a request formulated in English!  For example, they prefer to watch a series on the front desk computer rather than turning on the air conditioning before 10 at night, which makes it impossible to"
" member of staff came into our room at 2am the first night!  and when we surprised him asking what he was doing he told us he was ""checking that everything was ok"" and left straight away.  I can only advise against this place.  A star for the garden which is nevertheless nice.   Please note: towels are charged per day and additional costs if you have more than one piece of luggage per person or if you leave your luggage in storage for a few hours after your check out."

It is really lovely and has a good atmosphere related with nature, I really loved that they did have a/c at the shared room.  The beach club just amazing and so relaxing, I loved being there, next time I come I Will book to stay there.  Just one detail I would love that the staff could answe"
"We stayed at Agave blue for 3 nights and wished it could have been longer. The hospitality we received there was far and above any other accomodation we have stayed in throughout our 10 week trip in Mexico. The lake is absolutely magical and staying lake-side in Bacalar is an absolute must, worth every penny. We had our own private room with a bathroom and fully equipped kitchen, right at the lake front. We thought that staying out of town would hinder us but our wonderful hosts drove us in to town personal"
" response, besides that everything was good."
…
"My wife and I stayed for a week at Agave Blue. Teresa, made us feel like family. On our first night she even drove us to town to get groceries and any essential things we needed for our time there. Sebastian (staff member) was also checking on us making sure we were well taken care of. The facilities were clean, the garden is beautiful with a diverse variety of butterflies and birds. The views of the lagoon were to die for. You just walk a few steps and there you are. We hope to return soon."
"This hostal is right in downtown, plus it has an additional hostal outside with a nice beach, and they give you the transport for free.  Breakfast is average, the place is nice and the people is really friendly.   The only think that I did not like is that if you are leaving in the evening they charge you 50MXN to keep the luggage"
"Awesome people, loved it there. They are very nice and they will get you anything you need. The owner speaks better English than I do and they will give you advice and tips as many as you like. I already want to go back there. I hope I will see them again next time I visit bacalar. "
"WOW!   What a beautiful place where Mother Nature welcomes you with beauty, greatness and sweetness!  Everything is done so that you spend an unforgettable moment!  4 days is not enough to enjoy the place and soak it like a tattoo on the skin!  The availability and kindness of Teresa and Paul are extraordinary! Many kind attentions during our stay! Thank you Teresa for existing and for making us dream.    Thank you Teresa for having created this paradise yourself and especially for sharing it so generously!"
"We, four women traveling together, stayed on the main floor of the casa, an ample, very well furnished space with a view down a slope to the lake.  Teresa was an attentive and gracious hostess who even stocked the kitchen with eggs, bread, milk and butter.  She answered our many questions, giving us many valuable hints for our stay in Bacalar.  We enjoyed the fact that we were not in the heart of the town, and were grateful that we had rented a car, which gave us this freedom.  When we booked a four hour sa"

Moreover they furnish food just a little at the time, to make sure you don't take too much... - The hostel is still getting built. So it's not really peaceful.  - And last but not lea"

"I spent 12 days here in May 2016, in the bottom floor apartment with a beautiful view of the lagoon and lovely shaded patio. It was an amazing time to rest and relax, with swimming, kayaking, reading in the hammock, napping in lounge chair on patio. It really is perfect. Teresa, the owner, is terrific...so helpful and knowledgeable. I would not change a thing, and will certainly be back!!!"
" longer. This is honestly the first time i see this in an hostel, ans i have travelled a lot ! Usually, you can at least wait a few hours if your bus is a bit later, and use the kitchen and the bathroom.  So for all these reasons, i can say i have never seen worst hostel and staff in my life."
"We have been traveling a lot, between hotels and homestays, simple and luxury places. In Bacalar, Henry Inn feels like home. The owners treat us like family and take care of us, it is quiet and respectful of each other's space, wifi is good, and it's well maintained, a little oasis in a jungle-like space. We canceled our other hotels to stay here longer! The beds are more comfortable than in other luxury hotels also :) It is for sure simple, but everything we needed to feel grounded and happy!"
Fue una gran sorpresa al entrar. En su fachada no aparenta mucho pero adentro es un sitio muy bello y acogedor. Sus instalaciones cuentan con todo lo necesario y las habitaciones son bastante cómodas.... si a eso le sumas el trato cálido y familiar es un plus que difícilmente encontrarás en otro sitio. 100% recomendado y agradecemos haber esta allí.
"Great place for couples or families, Teresa is a great host. We enjoyed so much, was fun and the place very safe for swim and go in the kayaks. It's 10 minutes in car from the town so you feel by yourself lost in paradise."
"This trip was just one of the greatest with our family!! We where looking for calm and being alone from our busy world and that is exactly what we found in Agave Blue. The residence can accommodate 3 separate families in the same house, all still having independence... The house has its own lake entrance and is literally next to it. The rooms are gorgeous all equipped with the finest details and a great taste of decoration. Theresa the owner is just the sweetest lady!! And we even took Penelope our dog!! Wh"

" destination on its own with kayaking, boat tours, birding, good inexpensive local food as well as several more upscale lakeside restaurants. Within 1 hours drive there are also at least 3 very interesting ruin sites that don't attract the crowds. Bacalar is also a good stop for relaxing and regrouping from longer road trips to or from Belize, San Cristobal, Palenque and Campeche."

"We arrived late  from a long day of travelling we were greated by Jonathan and came into his bed and breakfast.   We looked at the room with a quick climpse and paid him for the stay, as we began to settle and have a shower which the hot water turned cold in five minutes, in the bath room ceiling was covered in mold painted over and I started having a respatory responds with my asthma.   After our shower I approached Jonathan about this and he started getting very upset, he mentioned why I didn't look at it"
" give him half what we paid for the trouble and the shower, He refused the offer and  kept the money for the stay and said he is working and I am traveling ."
…
"Jonathan and his wife have created a home away from home for guests. We stayed 2 nights and would have liked to stay more. The views of the lake are amzing, they are on the water and have kayaks to rent. Jonathan has a boat tour which we paid 700MX peso per person. He took us to local places on the lake to experience all there is to offer. Highly recommend the boat tour.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the breakfasts were great also, cereals, toast, beans, jams, yogurt, fruits.  And eggs were 50M"
A friendly homestay in a perfect location on the laguna. The staff were very welcoming and helpful.  We'd strongly recommend Jonathan's boat trip - it was one of the highlights of our whole trip. He helped us visit places around the laguna that few other tours go to. A great stay!
"I actually never do any reviews! But my sister and I were so intrigued by the hospitality and service of this amazing paradise that I /HAD/ to write this review.   Eduardo and all people are so amazing, there where any hotel or b&b is so focussed on service, these guys take it all a step further.   They really go beyond to make you have the best time ever and I highly recommend everyone to go to this beautiful place by the lake during their stay in Bacalar!!!

"We booked 3 nights towards the end of our 3 week trip of the Yucatán Peninsula. We had been traveling doing lots of activities so we just planned on chilling out at the property. We arrived to a major construction project and not at all relaxing. The property said they had to change the septic system to connect to city sewer, they never mentioned it to us, they said they did not have time, however, they contacted us previously and even on arrival day they contacted us and never mentioned construction.

"So this place is a gem. Raquel, the host, makes amazing an breakfast to order and is very knowledgeable of the area.  The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable, the hot water and showers are great!  There is a beautiful back garden to enjoy breakfast every morning.  "
"Beautiful rooms with breathtaking view, very sweet and helpful owners and staff and great homelike atmosphere!don't miss the chance to go on a boat tour with them off the beaten track!Highly recommended!We hope to come back one day!"
"My girlfriend and I (Polish and Irish) absolutely loved staying here. Not typical hotel luxury but Jonathan and his family and staff were incredibly welcoming and it felt like we were at a friend’s home (on a magnificent lagoon) which qualifies as luxury for us.   Definitely do the lagoon tour. Jonathan does it for a fitting price, which reduces if you join other guests (and we had a great time with a wonderful family who we joined). He tells you he’ll take you to some quiet spots where the other hotels don"
" quiet place is was before. We did witness the tour haggling on the street as we were looking for the property, which does not have any signage, make sure you have actual street address and you will have to have them open a gate for you if you are driving. The night we did stay we heard the neighbor’s dog barking in the night, not too much, but it did wake us up. And on the other side the neighbors run some sort of boat touring business and a couple was drinking and talking loudly in one of the boats until "

"The host is very kind and she gave us a good introduction and recomendations for Bacalar. The rooms are new built and very fresh and clean. The breakfast is good; bread, fresh fruits, cornflakes with milk and coffe/tea is included. Some may think it is too far from the center and lagoon, but it is only a 10 min walk. And it is even closer to the ADO Terminal (so you don't need to carry your luggage too far, perfect if you are backpacking). I am so happy with our stay. I recomend this hotel and if I visit Ba"
"We have stayed here for two nights. It was just great. Even though it looks nothing from the outside,once you pass that wooden gate, you start feeling right at home. The rooms are very clean, breakfast was nice as well. Not too expensive. A bit far away from the city center but we had a car so no bother. Free parking available "
"I was so disappointed! I wanted to love this place. I booked it knowing it was to be en experience. However as soon as we arrived things weren’t quite as nice as they seemed.  I wouldn’t really consider it pet friendly as there isn’t really a place to walk your pets.  They close the gate @ 10. Make sure to walk your pet before then The restaurant was not open, when we arrived so we went elsewhere. When we returned to settle in for the night, I realized there was absolutely NO toilet paper. I went yo the fro"
" a bit but the wifi is extremely bad.   I was looking forward to the shower, however it was only a trickle when I got up and then we realized the toilet wasn’t flushing either.   The view and the gardens were absolutely stunning.  However for 150 a night, we definitely expected toilet paper and water"
…
"Very friendly employees (especially the owner) and nice big absolutely clean room. We stayed one night and would book there definitely again! It's calm and has nice smelling soaps. Thanks a lot for the service. Hope Bacalar doesn't get too quick too touristy and destroyes the beautiful laid back atmosphere and unique nature (like Cancun, Playa and Tulum) because it's a cool town, not many tourists (but there are - of course) and the lagoon is gorgeous. Even though we've heard that this small paradise is sta"
"We only stopped to eat at their little restaurant, and it was delicious. The personnel was charming, and the hotel seems very nice, although we didnt explore more. Also the hotel and restaurant are pet friendly!"
"We loved this small hotel - the rustic stick and palapa roof cabins had all the amenities. No air conditioning of course, but this was completely unnecessary with the ocean breezes. We had a cabin near the stairs to the dock which had a lovely veranda to sit with friends or just relax in the hammock. Breakfast was included and was better than average with enchiladas one morning and scrambled eggs the next. Unless you need the american style hotels with ac and sophisticated decor, this is the place for you !"
"This is not a large place, but it was so comfortable.  The owner/host is of British and American desent ,and was plesant and went out of way to be of assistance.  The sheets and personal products were higher quality, and the sheets high thread count.  The AC was cold and the shower water was hot   Perfect  more than a great value, it was a pleasure ."
"Highly recommend this small hotel located in a quiet area of Bacalar. The rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained. All rooms seem to have air conditioning and cable tv. The owner is very helpful and speaks both English and Spanish. "
"Beautiful place - stunning view, amazing hammocks, great food. All ruined by the worst nights sleep due to zero sound proofing through bungalows. Unfortunately we had neighbours that sounded like they were in last throws of death with extreme coughing through the night and loud discussion of cough afterwards. The other significant mark against is the poor dog left tied to a tree that belongs to the hotel. Left from 3pm on day arrived and still there when leaving. No water, food. Heartbreaking to see. The so"
"I booked just one night here for my birthday. The hotel is beautiful and despite the fact that it rained through the whole time I was there it was still fantastic. The staff are fantastic and you can re t a kayak for 200 pesos, which is a good deal. The jetty on the lagoon is great and there are loads of hammocks. The restaurant did great food and even gave me a free dessert for my birthday. Our room was huge and I wish I had time to stay more than one night. There are plenty of places to hide in the rainy "
"The place is rustic with according to the front desk only one room with AC which is the room we got. Rooms are basic but charming. The food at the restaurant was very good, the highlight is the deck over the lagoon and hammocks. Excellent place for a really good rest in a fluff free environment. nice people"
"The place itself is beautiful and right on the water. It's a little outside of town, about 10-15 minutes driving, so you should drive because on a bicycle would be a little tiring.   It's an eco friendly place so they provide soap and shampoo that is better for their water processing, which is cool.   If you're staying in a room with your friend, be aware that the bathrooms are not quite closed off from the room, so they can see you using the toilet and showering, if they look over the half door, which they"
"even though we didn' t get a room since all booked - we came to look at it & were very friendly hosted for a drink, WIFI, look at the place. also a very good energy & very welcoming. we highly recommand the place."
Super clean room . This small hotel is close to everything located in a quiet secure area . The owners/hosts are a wealth of knowledge about the area and eager to help about all your needs . Highly recommended.
"Super quaint with only three rooms on-site, the hotel is located just off the highway (very close to the ADO station) and within walking distance to the city centre, fort, and of course, the lagoon.   The rooms were super modern, immaculate, and had everything you would need.   Carmen was there to greet us and offered excellent guidance on getting around and booked us a terrific boat tour.   We loved that it was located in a quiet neighbourhood, away from the blaring music of the city centre.  When we asked"
"This is a small family-owned boutique hotel with just 3 rooms. Carmen the owner is the nicest person ever!! So attentive!! My husband and I were on our honeymoon and she received us with a warm welcome and a beautifully decorated room. The rooms are super clean, well kept with all the necessary amenities. When I booked I asked for a coffee machine in advance, and sure enough Carmen placed a coffee machine in our room, with ground coffee to brew, coffee mate, sugar, coffee mugs and spoons. She also place wat"
"We were supposed to stay 3 nights in the hotel. At the first night, we noticed a strong moldy smell and after some looking around the room found, that the whole room was covered in black mold. We went to the receptionist who admitted, that they are having mold issues in the hotel and said, that there is no other room available. We spent the night in the room. The next morning we again contacted the front desk and, that we will leave, because the room is a health hazard. We had some questions regarding the r"
" Additionally, she offered to cook us breakfast every morning and even asked what time we wanted to eat. I cannot express how happy I am that we stayed with Carmen. Seriously the best host ever. Would come back here without a doubt. "
…
" refund, they are just waiting for the hotel to get back to them. At that point they started avoiding the refund situation with excusses like: we do not have the manager here right now, I can not make a decision regarding that and so on. Well 16 days have passed and the hotel does not respond, neither to me, nor booking. They are completley ignoring everything regarding the refund. They are completley ignorant and totaly unprofessional. Still waiting for their respose.....  Also, I would like to add, that b"
It is a good hotel. The rooms are clean and there are only a few of them. The location isn’t the best but it is good. The bathrooms smelled like pee but it was probably the chemical they use for the toilet. The cleaning lady didn’t fold our towels. It was good and the servers are nice. Not the best but it is good.
…
"If you like small hotels  (less than 10 rooms), privacy and silence, definitely this is the place to be.  Vanesa at the front desk will take care of all your needs and great recommendations The rooms have this minimalistic great looking with “polished” floors that look great. Everything is  super clean and you don’t have to worry about animals or insects.  Every morning, between 5 and 6 you’ll hear the singing of all kind of birds.  All the food (breakfast and meal) is great. But be patient as it is not a r"
Great hotel. Good rooms and nice beds. The roof terrace is nice to hang out in the afternoon an watch the sunset. Breakfast is really good as well. We had a rental car and there is some parking space available. 
"Special thanks to the manager, Veronica, for the great hospitality! 🙏🏻😊 The villa Miel was outstanding and everything was very clean. The food was exceptional and the staff friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay a lot!"
"We loved staying at Mi Kasa for most of a week.  The staff was lovely, just lovely in every respect, even purchasing a bottle of tequila blanco for us (we're not a fan of mescal or reposado).  The rooms were large and well-appointed.  The dining on site was excellent.  Looking over the lagoon while one eats or drinks is a lovely experience.  The hotel itself is just outside of the city so it is free of noise and partying neighbors."
"Booked for 2 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon. Lovely location, great staff, comfortable beds, super breakfast. I wish we had stayed longer! They even put beautiful flowers and swan towels and rose petals in our room upon arrival. So genuinely lovely!!"
"The staff is amazing, they go above and beyond. The location is great. Not on the water but just a short walk across the street.  Unfortunately for us we got rain the two days we were there but made the best of it.  The breakfast is great. The rooms are clean but just small."
"This hotel is sooooo nice!! It's about 5 minutes from the town and sits right on the lagoon! They have paddleboards and kayaks you can borrow at no charge. Victoria the GM is amazing, very welcoming and happy to recomend and guide you. The sunrises are amazing and they have a dock with hammocks where you can enjoy the stars at night!! The Suite is HUGE!! So definately worth the upgrade!! Bacalar is a must visit for great food, great views, and great people!!!"
"This place is beautiful, clean and quiet. Hotel is right on the lagoon surrender by nature away from the town noise.   The rooms are spotless, with cozy bed and nice bathrooms, smart tv included. Hotel also have a lovely pool, and restaurant.  "
"Hotel Sun Ha is in a perfect location in Bacalar right across from the public bathing area and jetty on the lagoon. An easy walk to the centre of town, the Fort and many excellent choices for restaurants right on the water! Our room was quite small but clean and tidy and functional. The upstairs deck was great for relaxing and the breakfast area was very attractive and comfortable. Above all the staff were fantastic - nothing was too much trouble! Thanks Hotel Sun Ha!"
"Sensational, small hotel located north of the center of Bacalar.  The hotel is new, very clean, the beds are comfortable and the rooms are spacious. There is a restaurant serving very good meals. The hotel also has direct access to the lake and free canoes. The service is very nice and you can feel at home here. We highly recommend  ."
"The staff is the hotel's jewel. Professional, attentive, take care of any request. All there suggestions was great. Thanks to Raoul, Marie Cruz, Regina and all the team. The breakfast is excellent almost more than 10 combinations. We stayed 3 wonderful days. Gracias "
"Nice hotel in a perfect location only 50m to the public jetty in the lagoon. Modern hotel, very clean rooms, nice staff, phantastic terrace with lagoon view. But be careful, only two rooms have the advertised balcony and our room hat the only window directly to the breakfast area. So if you are looking for a private balcony or a window to see the lagoon, check directly with the hotel. Our room was rather small, did not have the promised balcony and when oping the ddor, other guests taking thei breakfast cou"
"Hotel staff were very friendly and super helpful. Raül in the front desk was super nice and he gave us good recommendations of where to eat and where to go. MariCruz and Regina were the best ! Always so friendly with us and with our baby! We really enjoy the delicious breakfast every morning. This hotel is just steps away from the lagoon, you can walk and is public. The atmosphere was so nice and calm that we truly were able to relax. We love Bacalar !! And we will definitely be returning to Sun-Ha hotel.  "
Villa Sunrise is a very lovely place. The hotel is lacated right next to the lagoon which is wonderful. We really enjoyed the time spend here. The staff is very friendly. The Roms are clean and the bed is very big. We would visit another time again.
"It's a lovely quiet location on the lake with stunning views, though it is 15 minute drive to bacalar itself. My room was very comfortable, huge bed and a nice sized room. It's also very quiet which is great.  However, the hot water was very patchy, usually barely warm enough. And secondly, the breakfast it's truly terrible. The fruit selection, oranges or rock hard star fruit. The hot breakfast, cold completely overcooked scrambled eggs with off bits of veggies in, and some cold black beans. Toast but no b"
This place was beautiful I wish we could’ve stayed longer! The room is comfortable with an incredible view of the lake snorkeling and kayaking was fun. The shared kitchen is great looks like there is everything you would need to make whatever you would like. Charcoal Barbecue grill down by the water with chairs and tables to enjoy your meal. I would definitely stay here again. But my favorite part of all was the four month old yellow lab pup.
"The laguna is very beautiful at this spot. You can rent a kayak to explore the laguna, You can get snorkeling gear for free. The staff is kind and helpful, the breakfast is very good.  Thank you for a great stay!"
"My husband and I recently enjoyed 2 nights at the Bacalar Sunrise Villa. The owners have done a lovely job with this new facility. The dock is easy to negotiate, they have an SUP and bike with pontoons for the water (kayak is broken at the moment) that you can rent, the grounds have whimsical attractions for kids, the common areas are comfortable, and the en-suite guest rooms are spacious and nicely decorated.   Breakfast was delicious and plentiful, and every one of the staff was extremely friendly and hel"
"This place is magical...staff, super friendly, hotel premises super clean, room was super clean, comfortable and super spacious. Bed was super comfortable. Truly a peaceful place....exactly what i needed."
PROS:  Pet Friendly!    New boutique hotel nestled in the jungle and right on Laguna Bacalar. Very modern rooms. Nice modern bathrooms with large shower area and lots of hot water.  Great water pressure too. Plenty of counter-top space in the bathroom.   Very comfortable beds with crisp clean sheets. Good air-conditioning unit in the room.   A pitcher of drinking water was provided in our room. Just outside our door was a 5-gallon water dispenser for replenishing the pitcher.   Our room had a large balcony 
" view of the lake from our balcony.  Nice hot breakfast every morning = scrambled eggs, ham, frijoles, fresh fruit, toast, croissants, muffins, and variety of cereals. Fresh brewed coffee ready early every morning.    Community kitchen. We used it one night to make spaghetti. Since we are traveling throughout Mexico for 6 months, we like to be able to cook a meal instead of eating out every day. All the pots and pans were in great shape.  Access to the hotel’s (transparent, see-through) kayak, bikes and SUP"
…
We had such an amazing stay! Kris and her team are wonderful. Our room had a comfortable bed with private balcony overlooking the lagoon. Breakfast served was delicious and plentiful. We took a sunrise swim and also a kayak ride later in the day. We would definitely come back and stay longer next time.
"Hotel Aires is the place to stay in Bacalar! A cute boutique hotel experience it is amazing from the get go. The staff were so very attentive in everything from breakfast to organising tours! The rooms are amazing, big beds, great little balcony’s with a hammock, and the showers were to die for. The grounds of the hotel are kept so nice and the pool is fantastic. You are within walking distance of the lake and 5 mins to the main square.  Would highly recommend and if back in Bacalar we will be 100% staying "
"Best hotel we’ve stayed in Mexico. Great location, excellent service, and such an amazingly beautiful place. They have the most pretty garden we’ve seen, amazing wall paintings. And the rooms are excellent, large and clean. They’ve provided a baby bed for our daughter and we’re very helpful. And excellent value-for-money"
"Very nice and clean property with friendly  staff. Irving ensured we were taken care of since the moment we arrived.  He showed us around and went over the amenities and set up our Pontoon ride.   Breakfast was delicious and Daisy was very attentive and friendly.    Parking available. Room has coffee and water.  There is also a water  bottle refill station available in common area.   We loved the room ….very charming and relaxing.     This is a lovely hotel, very clean, well kept and charming atmosphere."
"You don’t need to be connected to the lagoon to enjoy Bacalar!  In fact, I’m so happy I found this gem. Close to everything in the city and also close to the municipal pier you will find your experience here amazing.   My favorites: sweet balcony with hamac, rooftop for sunrise on the lagoon and sunsets, right next to my favorite restaurant, playita.   I also booked a massage in my room that was perfect in every way!   Staff are incredible, I could talk about this hotel for days!"
"A small hotel very quiet with only 10 rooms. Breakfast is offered, rooms have A/C and a ceiling fan, we paid in pesos but I think US dollars are accepted as are credit cards. Close to the water so walking distance down. Near lots of restaurants. Generally favourable impression. We were booked for two nights but circumstances changed so we had to leave after only one night. Manager was very co-operative and gave us a partial refund, couldn't get all our money back as part of the cost was tax and she had to p"
"Hidden Gem. This hotel is beautiful and has a very attentive staff. The stay includes free breakfast, which only adds to the attention to details. We’re not talking continental either it’s a full spread of waffles, chilaquiles or scrambled eggs with juice or coffee.   Air conditioning is a life saver.   Close to the lagoon and city center which has restaurants and shops. 10/10 recommend."
"This place is a little gem. Right from the start, we were very impressed with Hotel Maria Maria. The room is spacious, clean and updated with a large veranda to enjoy the sunrise and a morning coffee. Fantastic location, within two minutes of the lagoon. Very quiet and peaceful. Nice breakfast included in the room rate as well as on-site parking. Friendly, helpful  staff. Not only would I highly recommend this hotel, I will most certainly return, for much longer than my current 3 days.  Bacalar itself is al"
"Super nice hotel, friendly & helpful staff, great location- close to water & lots of good restaurants. Very nice breakfast included. We had Chilaquiles, coffee, orange juice & fruit plate. Clean room and nice bathroom/shower. Balconies have hammocks 👍🏻"
"The Aires Hotel is awesome through and through! All employees are so incredibly friendly and always tried hard to make our stay pleasant. we were there for 4 days and would have loved to stay longer! When we arrived we had a room on the ground floor we asked whether one on the first floor would be free from tomorrow? When we came back the next day from our boat tour organized by the hotel, our luggage was already in the new room. also the pool just to feel good. and there was also a parking space. So in con"
"We booked a standard room and when they found out it was our honeymoon, they decorated the room and then asked if they could upgrade us to a suite for a second night as a treat to us. They arranged a great boat tour for us to the lagoon and 3 cenotes (at a much cheaper cost than other tour providers) and helped us arrange our transport on to Tulum. The included breakfast was fruit with yoghurt and granola, toast, juice and tea or coffee - with options to buy other elements. Very friendly staff (despite lang"
We stayed at Hotel Maria Maria for 3 nights while in Bacalar. The rooms are clean and modern for a small hotel. The location is good with only a small walk to most of the best restaurants. The owner(Maria) was really nice as we were there on the day of the dead and she explained the history to my two children and also let us taste some of the food she cooked for her family when they came over to celebrate. Hector the manager was also really good and gave us some excellent suggestions on things to do. He sug
"My husband and I just spent two nights at Hotel Aires.  We were greeted by the front desk staff all of whom were very helpful and pleasant.  Our room was extremely clean, the breakfast was very good each day, the pool and surrounding area was relaxing and we very much enjoyed it.  The entire hotel was kept very clean and the environment was excellent and refreshing.  We highly recommend Hotel Aires Bacalar.  Santiago at the front desk was very helpful arranging for our sailing outing and answering our many "
"Things didn't get off to the best start here, but they sorted it. Basically, I think I had been trying to economise and had booked the cheaper room that claimed to have a balcony and courtyard view. It had neither and it was rather dark. The description on Booking.com is wrong. We complained about this and the owner and her son(I think) apologised and offered to move us for half of what would normally be the extra fee. We thought that was a good compromise, especially as she looked at the description and pr"
"The hotel had us already. Beautiful look of modern art, drawings and reed leaves. El jefe, julia and everyone else have been so friendly and made this stay a pleasure. Rooms and balcony were relaxing and clean. Breakfast was rich.  Marco e Isa"
" you don't get the noise either. As with nearly every other place we stayed, the wi fi was poor."
"Three friends escaped Vidanta and made our way to this magical lagoon in Bacalar.  We loved the hotel, hospitality of the staff and their recommendations for attractions.  Would definitely return to this awesome location.  "
…
"The location of this property was great, 5 minutes walk to the main square, 2 minutes walk down to the docs of the lake. The room was lovely, great balcony. Shower was good. Extra safety if you stayed on the upper floor of the hotel. Great service."
"Simply beautiful:  We loved the lush garden with succulents and frangipani trees, the neatly maintained pool area & the bamboo façades The rooms are very clean, decorated with beautiful design elements/details and the private bathrooms are spacious and you‘ll get amenities with natural ingredients  The breakfast options are freshly prepared local and healthy The music is very relaxing in the breakfast area & the lobby, at night its quiet and at sunrise you can hear birds singing The vistas from the upper ba"
"I brought my mom here for a little girl’s get away. This place is amazing we were here 8 nights and we saw all kinds of people stay here. Singles, couples and families and there was definitely something for everyone. Hobies on site activity directors were amazing. Ask for Gustavo he is so attentive and will make sure that you or your little ones have fun and are comfortable on the kayaks or paddle boards which are FREE btw. I can’t say enough about this place. Food great. Service amazing. Just completely ex"
"The manager of the hotel was so sweet with our late arrival. She explained everything and answered any questions we had. The hotel is very clean a small in a perfect walking location to the lagoon and central square. Tons of restaurant options within walking distance. Although the hotel was fully booked, it was quiet and we slept great the entire time! Beds were comfy as well. Will definitely be back! "
"This is a charming hotel with lagoon front villas! A refreshing swimming pool and 3 piers for you tu access and swim the lagoon. A picture perfect place for sure. The best part is that you have everything you need on location! A new signature restaurant for dinner “Balik”  by Chef Xavier Perez strongly recommended, a bar and restaurant right by the pool and water sports included. If you want to upgrade the experience you can hire a sailboat to tour the lagoon (I strongly recommend this option). But it you j"
"The central location is perfect to walk almost everywhere the staff is very nice and the food is fresh ! you can enjoy the use of kayak and paddle boards. lagoon is wonderful and we do recommend this place , because of its cool vibe! Mr victor was awesome , gracias  ! We do recommend to book the cabanas over the main building bedrooms."
"We stayed 3 nights as our friends had a wedding nearby the hotel. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were excellent and we also had a dinner there one night which was also super tasty.  They have everything you need, o booking included free rental of kayaks and paddle boards which is a must thing to do at the Lagoon. Another must is the Yoga at sunrise, it was an unbelievable experience (also included)  Actually then reason I’ve decided to write is a review is the excellent service we "

"From the moment we arrived, Berenice made us feel incredibly welcomed. Everything was perfect, Marcos our waiter was fantastic, and all the staff at the bar as well. Thank you to Reyna and Victor too!"
"What a gem! When you find a place that’s so wonderful, you don’t want others to know, so they don’t flood the location and ruin its beauty. This is that kind of place! From check in to our wonderful 5 days stay, I have no complaints. The staff made you feel like family and the breakfast served was delicious. They’re located in a part of the Lagoon that boast soft white sand/mud beneath the water with the most crystalline waters we saw during our entire 2 weeks stay at Laguna Bacalar. The hotel is pet friend"
Loved this place! The view of the lagoon was amazing! The service and staff were fantastic. The food and drinks were delicious. I was there with friends and our kids for 6 nights and we had a great time. I will definitely go back to Bacalar and stay there for sure.
"Our stay at Casa Bakal was incredible. The staff was all SO SO HELPFUL AND KIND. Stephany, David, Pablo, Jesus, and Rodo were just a few staff members that really stuck out to us and made our experience better. The bungalows we had were very simple, no tv, fridge, or mirrors but we didn’t mind much. The view from the hotel is beautiful, with a small pool and a boardwalk leading to the lake. They rent paddle boards and one person kayaks free of charge right by the lake. There is complementary breakfast daily"
"Vine con mi Familia y nos gusto mucho, todos son muy amables, la comida súper rica, no es necesario salir a comer. Con los Kayaks y Paddle que te prestan te entretienes mucho. Asael y Santos nos atendieron de maravilla!  Los cuartos muy limpios, solo hace falta un closet para acomodar la ropa."
"El hotel está padrisimo, ideal para escaparte a relajarte. Los cuartos súper cómodos y tienen kayaks para que puedas usarlos en tu estancia.  La atención y la comida son espectaculares!  Azael Paat y Santos nos brindaron el mejor servicio, súper atentos y agradables."
"El hotel es muy cómodo, la atención qué brindan en el restaurante es excelente y toda la comida está deliciosa, el trato es amigable. Las instalaciones están en buenas condiciones y puedes realizar distintas actividades por parte del hotel, cuentan con un tour por la laguna a un precio accesible y ofrecen el uso de Kayaks completamente gratis."
"Other than the hotel's location, there is no reason to recommend staying here!  We had stayed here before, and it was an adequate place.  I can't say that now!  The rooms were in poor condition, paper thin walls let us hear conversations in other rooms, the bed linen was not clean, lumpy pillows...  The rats outside were the last straw!  Skip this hotel!"
"El lugar está increíble, de verdad vale la pena.  La Laguna de verdad está preciosa, además te prestan unos Kayaks padrísimos para ir a conocer la Laguna y Andrea la host es súper atenta!!   Lo recomiendo 100% para parejas, los cuartos están increíbles y súper callado."
"Do not expect any luxuries, for the price it is a good deal , just to sleep and shower it is very well located , you can see everything you want to see in bacalar walking that is why we decided to stay there overnight"
Low cost hotel. Great view to the lagoon. Cleand and tidy. You get more than what you pay for. Cleand sheets and towels free coffee and one of the very least hotels with a/c in the area. Very close to the town and forth. It has no restaurant but close to some good options. You can rent activities at the hotel
"The rooms are a good size. This is probably the cheapest hotel that we stayed in during a three week trip. The beds, bed linen, towels etc reflected this. But it wasn't bad and certainly value for money. The location, next to a park, means that you risk events having loud music until the early hours (we were unlucky). It is basically a sleeping location. There were young families and a wonderful group of 'older ladies' who chatted and played cards on the grass. It doesn't do food, you need to go out.  That "
Great place to spend a nigth or weekend with the person you love. I enjoyed my stay especially when it was time to swim in the lagoon of the 7 colours ! great for the entire family . great customer service and friendly staff
"Great deal!  Right on the lake, nice dock to walk and swim from, close enough to walk to the town center and restaurants.  Beds were comfy, showers good.  Don't count on this for morning coffee.  Jar of decafe nescafe and a pot of hot water."
"Me and my fiancé loved this hotel. It has a big room and stunning view. On the main floor there is a place to relax next to the beach.  The location is perfect- on the Laguna and close to the center. There are boat tours next to the hotel and they are with the cheapest price we could find in the area.  We asked them for recommendation for a place to eat and they gave us a voucher for 2 margaritas in a nice meat restaurant.   Cons: the room is dark and there is no breakfast, but we found some place close wit"
Nice hotel directly beside the lagune shore with a pier and chairs to lay on for sunbading! The rooms were spacious but the beds a bit hard. Friendly staff! Fresh water in the lagune and ideal for snorkeling although not much to see under the surface.
We came to Bacalar in night and were looking for some hotel where we may sleep. We cannot find there any hotel which was opened. Finally we found this hotel near a lake. It cost 800 pesos per night. It was simple but clean and spacious. You may find there everything you need when you are on the trip. I think that probably majority of their clients stay there only for one night. Bacalar looks like it is after its big times of tourism.You may see the whole village in one hour. Round trip around the lake cost 
"Nearly $60 is what they charged for a double. The lovely location and the fact that we did not get a chance to read tripadvisor before leaving home. The ""gotcha factor"". Mattresses hadn't been turned in years, towels with huge holes... Come on now you cheap so and sos! They spend plenty on the outside bright yellow wash. Awful shower head. Just SUPER CHEEPO all the way round. Accept only cash - probably don't pay any taxes. No front desk service. Ran out of t-paper.  Can I stop already? Oh yeah, the a/c was"
"Not worth the money. Basic room, terrible breakfast, uninterested personel, chairs and kanoos near the water broken. How they dare to ask this money. Als no help with tours, no drinks available, no shops around. Most bad deal in town.  "
"Muy agradable el hotel.La pase súper bien.....el personal súper atento y lo mejor que caminando llegas a todos lados 15 min al centro y av costera donde está la Laguna 8 min caminando,sin duda regresaría"

"L'albergo si trova nella zona residenziale, un po lontano dalla spiaggia della laguna pero noi eravamo con macchina e questo non era un problema. La camera era spaziosa e ben pulita. Il personale gentilissimo. Il vantaggio maggiore e' un parcheggio privato gratuito. Si consegnano teli mare. Tutta la notte c'e una persona sorvegliando l'entrata della struttura che senz'altro e' ben chiusa. Siamo rimasti molto contenti. L'unico difetto e' che l'aqua calda e da caldaia e finisce molto presto. La seconda e in n"
"sin duda un hotel, bonito, muy comodo , la alberca pequeña, pero relaja, por que no hay nada que te distraiga, la comida economica y muy buena relacion costo, lo malo, que esta a 33 kms de bacalar y esta en medio de nada, si no traes carro, definitivamente no un opcion, no hay servicio de 11 a 5 en el restaurante y la tienda mas cercana esta como a 500 metros tiene bicicletas, pero con el sol es la muerte ir, la entrada a la laguna esta fea y esta tambien como a 500 metros,te decepcionas al ir, la atencion "
"Sous des aspects modernes, cet établissement est désastreux. Eau froide, insonorisation nulle ce qui permet d’être au première loge pour le concert d’aboiements et des invités du personnel qui profites de la piscine en picolant et fumant sans compter les rires bruyants. Le prix est bas mais Cher finalement pour une d’insomnie... "
"The hotel is very nice, rooms are big and very clean and the garden area is cool for breakfast. 24h reception makes you feel safer. Good WIFI. The location is perfect, just a few steps away from everything. The staff is extremely helpful. Adrián made us feel like home and helped us sorting out all the activities while in Bacalar. When we left we forgot a couple of things in the hotel and he arranged for it to get dropped off back in Tulum for us at no extra cost at all. The best costumer service ever! Total"
 ir ahi.
"This hotel is run by a very nice family.  In their backyard they have a building with about eight rooms on two floors  The rooms have good beds, a hot shower and a good working air conditioner. WiFi is slow but ok.  In their garden there are some tables and chairs where you can sit during the day or evening.  The hotel is walking distance from the main square and many restaurants and bars. It’s also ten minutes walking form the public ‘beach’ (free) where you lay in the sun or take a swim in the crystal cle"
"The hosts are super friendly and happy to please. A hearty breakfast is included. The views are outstanding from Las Nubes. The hosts are new and working on upgrades, which are required at the dock and in some of the rooms.  The property is beautiful and I recommend it!   Best if you have a car, as it is out town."
What a sunrise and birds in the morning!   This hotel is located close to town but not that close which make it a great place to see nature specially birds.   The staff was so nice that even they offered to prepare coffee at 4 am before we go for a birding trip!   Very clean and we felt safe.  I recommend this hotel for nature lovers and birders as the birds come to your window!   
"I was fortunate to spend 4 days at Las Nubes in Bacalar and couldn't have been more happy. It is obviously right on the water which is right where you want to be and it has everything you need to enjoy the laguna: kayaks, SUPs, peddle boats, docks, lounge areas, etc. The breakfast was delicious, the rooms were comfortable and the staff is amazing! We will definitely come back and stay in this little piece of paradise. The value is incredible!"
"We loved this hotel, wonderful view and direct access to the lagoon!  with multi-level seating areas, very cute and small.  The breakfast was amazing: fresh granola, eggs, fresh squeezed fruit juice, and great service.. more than we could eat!  The rooms are large and comfortable with a modern and simple design, I particularly liked the front room by the gazebo, with wonderful exotic wood decor. The management is very attentive and the prices are reasonable:  would highly recommend."
"Las Nubes was an amazing place to stay during our trip to Bacalar. The rooms are spacious, great air conditioning, and views of the lagoon right from the room. They also provide breakfast which was made to order and 5 star service.   They have paddleboats and kayaks to rent too. My favorite part of the hotel is the multi tiered terraces that go down to the dock. Great place to visit with family or friends!"
"Definitely one of the places you need to visit if you want an amazing view for a romantic escape, I will come back very soon. The host are incredible people who are always trying to make you happy. Highly recommended"
"Ahora les cambiaron el nombre y se llama XO Bacalar Lakefront, en primera el lugar está viejo y descuidado, nuestra habitación tenía un fuerte olor a caño que provenía de la regadera y fue muy incómodo ya que impregnaba todo el cuarto. Las toallas igual viejas, al menos limpias pero nos tocó una que decía Promotora Residencial, osea no sabemos si fue de un huésped que la olvido o qué pasó. La cortina del baño rota, ek conclusión les falta bastante mantenimiento. Lo único rescatable fue el desayuno, ese si m"
"My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights in casa Bambù in August. It’s a small hotel, managed by a lovely family. They organise a boat tour of the Laguna (one of the most beautiful place we’ve seen in Mexico). The frontlaguna room is amazing, with a private patio with direct to water. We arrived very late in the night and the host has been very kind to provide us a dinner. The hotel is very quiet and perfect for a couple who want to spend some relaxing days.   Biagio&Gaia"
"Hotel pequeño, nuevo con acceso directo a la laguna y un bonito muelle. Lo malo: NO reciben tarjetas! Ojo! esto es bien importante, si no llevas efectivo, toca ir al pueblo que está retirado! y el hotel no es fácil de encontrar porque no tiene letrero. El internet no llega a las habitaciones y en el lobby es muy deficiente.  Desayuno empiezan a servir 8.30, así que si vas a salir de paseo antes no aplica. Cero amenities en la habitación! No hay TV (para algunos esto suma, así para otros no). Es más como un "
"Un lugar increíble en donde Fernanda y Jonatan nos atendieron extraordinariamente, la casa está ubicada junto al lago por lo que la vista es espectacular, la tarifa incluye el desayuno el cual es delicioso y la renta de kayak por lo que puedes visitar la laguna y disfrutar al máximo la experiencia "
"Es increíble este lugar, no hubo absolutamente nada malo todo es un 10 definitivo. De verdad el servicio es maravilloso y tienen un sistema muy ordenado y práctico para ellos y para el cliente estar en contacto, desde antes hacen un grupo por whatsapp y te envían toda la información y están a tus órdenes. Donde se encuentran más de 2 personas atendiendo tus dudas o solicitudes, tienes su atención 100% jamás había visitado un lugar así. Definitivamente es una EXPERIENCIA. Las cabañas (todas) son únicas. Todo"
"The place is a 8 room complex, it has a shared diner, terrace, dock and beach. The location is amazing given that is right on the water and you can access the water by a sandy beach and a spacious dock with hammocks, chairs and a cool overwater net. They have kayaks and paddle boards in place which is pretty cool. The room I stayed at was a king sized bed with beautiful view to the water and TV. Everything was clean, the service personnel attentive and helpful, seems like there's new management. I enjoyed a"
All the normal amenities but only 1 closed restaurant within walking distance. Enjoyed using free kayak but refrained from swimming as lake very shallow and bottom muddy. Friendly staff. Easy check in and out.
"There was one night there and my boyfriend. We arrived at the site and it was empty of people and we did not find anyone to accept us. Finally we found a note on the refrigerator with a phone number, called the number, and the guy in charge came to check in. There was no water in the shower. The cleanliness of the room was very bad. The location was also not good, to get to the center there is a 10 minute walk or more The only plus is the beautiful pier in the garden towards the lagoon."
"Nous sommes allés dîner à l'hôtel sans connaître la carte ou les tarifs. La cuisine est très copieuse en plus d'être très bonne. Les tarifs sont plus élevés que les ""petits"" restaurants mais restent abordables. Le service était top avec une serveuse très souriante ! Nous étions seulement les 4 à dîner ce soir là, dommage pour un si bel endroit..."
"Es un hotel nuevo por lo las instalaciones se encuentran en perfectas condiciones, el desayuno es bastante bueno y el personal super amable. La ubicación excelente cerca de la laguna y cerca de muy buenos restaurantes. Una muy buena experiencia!"
"Caroline dont allow wifi around the talking area. You know travellers, for god sake talk  to each other? Your not travellers if based on your mobile phone, particularly in a place like this! God! Common sense?  She is sensational and wonderful!, Caroline from the USA!  Last there like 4 years ago or so, and she was ill then. Hope you are doing great now Caroline! Regards Peter from Denmark! ;)  Best setting in Laguna Bacalar..And Caroline knows everything going around...Just ask!  A lovely lady, who made a "
"The place looked cosy, but after we moved in we realized that the place was unpleasant since the host behaved erratic and mean. I was scared since he got really angry due to a minor misunderstanding. There were ants in my bed, but I didn't dare to complain. We felt sorry for the staff, they were constantly under oppression from the crazy host."
We stayed here a couple nights and enjoyed the amazing views of the Lagoon and swimming from the pier. They are a budget friendly place to stay and very chill.  They also have boats for excursions to different places on the Lagoon. 
"Es un lugar modesto e ideal si viajas solo, los encargados son muy amables, yo viaje sola y me trataron súper. Incluso me cambiaron de habitación a una mejor y me apartaron un día más, además me cobraron menos y me dieron toda la información necesaria para visitar lugares en Bacalar... Recomendable si andas solo y no quieres gastar mucho..."
"Beautiful site! We started out in another accommodation but it was full of people making a lot of noise and dogs barking all night. We decided to move to Casita Carolina and could not have been happier! We stayed in a cute little trailer camper, very well priced. Snug but for camping way better than a tent!  Beautiful gardens, relaxed atmosphere, friendly owners and a view to die for! Only good things to say about this place. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
"I did an overnight stop at Casita Carolina. They have a variety of accommodation styles here - a few different types of room, two cute little caravans and a camping area.  I stayed in the yellow room. If I'm honest, it was a sweatbox. It was very hot overnight, even with 2 fans blowing. One on the ceiling, one at the end of the bed. Otherwise the room was fine. I can't comment on other accommodation.  The owner is lovely, and made me feel very welcome. There's coffee on the terrace in the morning, and water"
" gazebo. You can rent kayaks, and there's a jetty to sit on/jump off.   To summarise, you can't go wrong at 600 (cash) for the night. It's beautiful.  Top tip - get up early for sunrise. It's immense!"
"Excelente atención, instalaciones, limpieza y sanitización. Muy cómodo, excelente relación valor-precio. Buena ubicación, cerca de accesos públicos a la laguna. El servicio super cálido y amable siempre con una sonrisa. Muy buenos anfitriones, muy recomendable. "
…
"A small clean place in Bacalar just in front of the most amazing view, it's a budget friendly place to stay, the room shares a kitchen and a living room with another room, the kitchen has a normal sized fridge, it is in my opinion fully equipped and this can help you save money on food... The rooms are good, nothing fancy or special, but that's not a problem since the view and the garden are beautiful!!! The location is priceless, just in walk-in distance from the center of the town 2-3 minutes, most hotels"
"Things did not get off well with Casita Carolina. They have a backward policy that requires guests to email 48 hours in advance to confirm your already confirmed booking. Even if you email earlier that week, without another email 48 hours in advance they will not hold you're booking. We have been backpacking around mexico and was only able to email 36 hours in advance and upon arrival they had already on-sold our third night. Leaving us without a room for a final night in bacalar. It was never stated in any"
" cancelled one of our 3 nights we would have most definitely booked another guest house. Appalling service. And downright sneaky.  Obviously off to a poor start the stay did not improve. We had bugs and lizards in our room. Cold showers.  The jetty was being repaired and was not in use (literally one of the biggest reasons to go here is the long jetty into the Blue lagoon). With the repair comes ongoing construction noise, so no tranquil setting here.  They have kayaks available but no one is home during th"
"Hermoso lugar, las fotos reflejan un bello lugar. Pero al llegar nos dimos cuenta que es es mas lindo aún. Super acogedor y la atención de sus dueños es genial, son muy amables. Pasamos dos noches hermosas!! La pile es super linda, muy cómodas todas sus instalaciones. "
"Me encantó , está todo muy limpio y cómodo y cuenta con un excelente servicio y muy buena ubicación, las habitaciones son muy amplias y está muy bien equipado con todo lo necesario, sin duda lo recomiendo y lo volvería a visitar"
"Es un hermoso lugar donde a solo unos metros tienes acceso a la laguna de Xul-ha y esta inmersa en la selva. Se da una experiencia única donde te vuelves parte de la naturaleza,  con una gran variedad de aves en sus alrededores.  Los anfitriones son increíbles y hacen que tu experiencia sea inolvidable.   Muy recomendable.  "
"Amazing stay, brand new boutique hotel in the beautiful Bacalar, friendly and helpful staff, has rooms that can fit a whole family or friend group! Includes continental breakfast and bikes for guests. Highly recommended and definitely will return!!!"
"We camped here for three nights and absolutely loved it here! The hosts are very friendly and helpful, they answered all our many questions—what are the names of all the fruit trees? Best place to rent kayaks? Best place to buy groceries? Etc.—always with lots of smiles. I miss hearing Ellie calling everyone, “hija/hijo” and “corazon” :) And watching Regino looking after the garden and the fruit trees like they’re family (because they are!).   We called everyone that offers camping in Bacalar before making "
" fantastic!! As bikepackers, we had our own tent but they also have tents available too and they gave us sleeping pads, sheets and cute pillows :)  We miss being here so much and Highly recommend!!"
"We really enjoyed our stay and felt very comfortable in the large and clean room! (Two double beds, hammock, TV, two air conditions, nice bathroom.) The owner made us feel very welcome and offered information in a friendly and unobstrusive manner. "
"We were a group of 4 friends and we stayed there for one night. The room was comfortable and very clean. The owner is a very nice guy, he helped us a lot and also let us leave our bags over there all day after we checked out, because we had a night bus. The price was fair. We recommend it highly."
"A decent little hostel. This place is a good option for people on a budget. Clean room, good wifi and friendly owner. This doesn't have a typical hostel vibe. With no breakfast and a very small common area there isn't much opportunity to meet fellow guests."
We were only there to wait for our tour. We booked a sailboat tour. They didn’t have any food and no Diet Coke :( anyway the tour was great and the guys were nice but the point of doing the sailboat tour was to NOT use an engine which they did a little bit
"Close enough  to the centre of Bacalar (not on the lake shore itself though), this is a good hotel with fair prices. The staff was friendly and let us fill up our water bottles. Only negative would be that the wifi didn't reach our room (but did work in the lobby)"
"Excellent option, very clean, comfortable and safe.  Very well located, close to the park, the lagoon, the fort and many restaurants, shops and bars.  Mr Antonio, the guy in charge, is extremely helpful and friendly."
"Nous sommes restés 5 jours en famille dans ce magnifique hôtel. Décors très soignés, piscine à débordement, ponton sur la lagune avec hamacs, kayaks et paddles. Les chambres sont spacieuses et magnifiques. Le personnel est très professionnel et sympathique. Le restaurant est très bien également. L'hôtel au calme est situé en bord de lagune à 9,5 km du centre de Bacalar."
"Call me biased, call me subjective, but this place has a vibe. Always good music, always good drinks, happy hour is your friend in this place (5pm-7pm). Bring shazam and try the speed coffee. You can also swim here but no sand beach."
Staff is so nice and speaks english. The drinks at the bar are super delicious. We came to just enjoy the beach in a quiet place and all we had to do is consume something either at the restaurant or bar. I strongly recommend this place for an afternoon of relaxation.  
"We travel with my son (4 years), Antonio help us a lot with accomodation, very well located and cheap, clean, comfortable and everything is at hand. They're not luxury rooms, but nicer than you usually get for this price, is one of the best options in Bacalar. We had a great time! ."
"Small inn above a pharmacy in central area. Owner very friendly and helpful. Large room, adequate bathroom with soaps and things and all the hot water you need with good water pressure. Walk to park,restaurants.  Owner set me up with a great tour of the lagoon."
"I'm currently staying here at the Hotel Lunas in Bacalar,Mexico on the Yucatan peninsula.The hotel is in a residential area,but food options are within walking distance and the downtown area is only about 10 to 15 minutes on foot.This is a small property with 2 floors and the second floor has only 3 rooms.I'm in room 6,king size comfy bed with great pillow and linens,quiet air con,walk-in shower,min-fridge,and a large balcony with hammock plus a lovely view to the Bacalar lagoon.  Add to this complimentary "
"This place is practically not a hostel anymore. The room was miserable, and most of the services they list were unavailable. My understanding is that the place has financially suffered from Covid-19 and undergone major administrative changes. They now use the room next to the gate/by the street as the reception area, which is also the place where the volunteers/staff are housed and the sheets/towels are stored. This is also the room where hostel customers are housed. So, anyone who comes to check in or ask "
"They have great atmosphere in front of the lake, all the services, the rooms are very cosy, the staff is very nice, and they have an amazing sailing boat to sail around the lake. All you need from Bacalar is there!"
"We decided to go visit the Mayan Ruins and there we purchased a combo ticket that gave us entrance to the ruins plus the casa tortuga cenote. You get better discount doing that. At casa tortuga we had an awesome time. Never has been to a cenote , so this was a true surprise. The ticket gives you entrance /tour to all 3 cenotes ( two cave ones and one open ). The guided tour was great! The water was a bit cold, but expected once these are cabe cenotes. I was a bit scared and had a bit of an anxiety once the "
"Guadalupe is a good bet if you are in Bacalar. Antonio is a gem, really helpful and full of advice. He can book you the best boat trip in Bacalar with Amir.   The place is spotlessly clean and tidy. It is a good, basic and friendly bed for the night and is very well priced for the area.   Antonio was also spot on with all his local recommendations."
"Colorful 2 story building with friendly efficient English speaking staff. Large room with big window overlooking the private rooftop terrace which has hammocks & a shaded sitting area, where you can even see the lake. Water Jugs in the Hallway to fill your own container, 24 hr coffee & bikes to use are a nice touch. Room has a luggage rack, refrigerator, flat screen TV, WiFi, Hot shower & cold AC. And THE Absolute Most Comfortable Bed I’ve been in while in Mexico (41 days) plus a Perfect Pillow & Even a Ful"
" advance about this late check-in and been told to knock on the window to get them check me in. One of the volunteers checked me in after confirming my reservation on his phone, and I paid him for my stay in cash, as requested. The room did not have an AC, only fans, some of which were broken. I only slept a few hours that day and had to sleep in one of the hammocks outside for the rest 2 days because the room was unbearably too hot. The bathroom was dirty and stank, and the room always smelled like the bat"
" truly in a very wooded area jungle like, WEAR BUG SPRAY!! On our way to the open one , going thru the jungle , we had a visit of 2 medium to big sizes monkeys which were jumping from one tree to another. Quite of an experience !! It was very fun to spot them and they will mind their business but my boyfriend decided to stay extra minutes to film them. Well, I don’t think they like that , they hissed at him lol. So a little side note, admire them but don’t try to be friends with them. Once we got to the cen"
"We found this hotel after walking around a few and finding prices higher than expected. The price for our room at Guadelupe was much lower than we saw listed online.  The rooms are very clean and the bed is great. We chose a room without A/C, but the ceiling fan was really good and kept us very cool. There's even a hammock you can tie up in your room if you just want to chill! They're not luxury rooms, but nicer than you usually get for this price. Best wifi I've had in a while as well.  The location is goo"
"We stayed for 2 nights. The owner was very friendly and helpful. Gave us a few great tips for food and things to do.  There are two dogs roaming around, but they are very good behaved. So as long as youre not terribly afraid of lovable short-legged dogs, i can fully recommend this place.  Would go there again."
"A 10 min ride (20 pesos) from the ado coach stop. Situated not far from the lake, and 1.5km from the town centre. Free bikes provided so everything is easily accessible. Some basic medicines available in reception to buy, and free water provided from a machine. Beds were comfortable but had hot synthetic sheets. Shower and aircon both powerful and good quality linens. Tea and coffee provided, and cold toast if you want it for breakfast. WiFi signal good. Very nice staff. No safe or deposit box available. Ov"
"We came to Bacalar without a reservation and count ourselves lucky that Hotel Lunas crossed our path. Very friendly, very comfortable, no more, no less. Coffee and toast included. Hummingbirds in the garden, good walking distance to centre of town. Bicycles for rent."

" night in the end. If you're looking for a clean, basic room in Bacalar: I recommend this place."
"We stayed for two nights and had a great time! The place feels cozy and has a great tropical vibe. The cabanas are not that big, but big enough to leave your stuff and have a good sleep - airconditioning/electricity works really well! The cabanas come with a seperate bathroom with toilet/shower for your own use. Nice swimming pool and places to hang out and relax. You can also eat/drink something at the bar and WiFi is available. Had a great time overall!"
"We have found this place at the last minute and it was a wonderful surprise, the receptionist was really helpful and kind. Everything was clean and the room was lovely, we had a big balcony, AC worked perfectly, best bathroom (and room) we had in Mexico at the moment !!  Thank you for everything. "
"Loved everything here. The energy of this place & the sunrise just in front of Casa Lahar! The location is perfect, away from the city centre yet walking distance nearby. The beautifull & magical lagoon just in front. Friendly staff that spoke good english and always ready when needed. Thank you Dani, Legna and everyone else for this great experience. Definitely coming back to this place when I'm in Bacalar. And love to recommend Casa Lahar."
"We stayed just one night in Bacalar (amazing place!) but unfortunately the room we got in Casa Tortuga was not at the same level with our expectation. We paid quite some money for Mexican price room standard and we got a really tiny private room for 3 people, super dark and humid. I would expect more from this hostel."
"Fui de visita a Bacalar y acabamos en Casa Tortuga por casualidad, comimos una ensalada de fresa, una hamburguesa 50/50, y unos tacos de fajitas de res, la comida estuvo rica, me encanto la hamburguesa 50/50, pero lo mejor fue el cantinero ya que las chicas que tomaron nuestra orden de comida fueron groseras y el cantinero nos ayudo a pasar el mal rato con su disposición y sonrisa. Bebimos dos piñas coladas, una naranjada, una limonada con menta y un speed coffee que contiene Kalua y fue el descubrimiento d"
"I loved the concept of the B&B and had a very pleasant stay there with my mother. The staff is extremely friendly, you can feel they truly care about how much of a great stay their guests are having. The place is in really good shape and fits the price range well. Spending a night in a tube-shaped room was quite the memorable experience, I hope to stay there again sometime soon!   A few things to note: (1) the crowd is generally quite young (might not be the best option if you’re looking for a very quiet pl"
{This is written in London on 1/4 referring to our stay on Friday and Saturday nights 10-11/3. I could not find it on TA originally so notified TA as a new hotel.

We arrived and they allowed us to check in before 3 because the room was ready Wich made it easier for us because we were only there for one night.

Since I arrived very late, they have left me my room’s key and everything was in order. The next morning, they prepare your breakfast and you can enjoy it with lot à of interactions with the owners and staff, reachable & responsive at all times. I used the bike for free and got around Bacalar by it!  Last but not least, you can have pizza or a "
I would definitely recommend checking this place out! I had a very nice ambiance to it. There are private rooms available with a shared bathroom (bathroom was very clean) the option to tent also. Amir is the tour guide for that casa....amazing personality and great energy! I will be back...and I’ll remember to bring the keys with me this time! Hahaha much love 
We are very happy we stayed in this small hotel in Bacalar. It's in quiet area very close to the best restaurants ever! The host is very helpfull and very nice person. Breakfast was very good. Bedroom clean. Bacalar is amazing place to visit.
 gusto y Hasta la proxima vez !
"Been staying at this hotel everytime I come to visit Bacalar. Hotel is clean, has lagoon access, restaurant 8am-11pm, friendly staff, reliable wifi, and overall fair prices. In this last trip, I notice a lot of surprise charges such as $300. If you lose your room key (Thank God we didn't) you can't consume any food bought outside of hotel and the one that surprised me was check out. Hotel staff checks room upon leaving 😧...just in case you would like to take their towels? I just thought that was rude.  Anot"
"Hostel has a nice location on lake front where on can rent rooms, share rooms, rent tents or bring tents. However, it is sometimes loud when camping outdoors. Casa Lahar is ""pet friendly"" which sometimes means that people bring dogs that are aggressive or bark a lot. This happened while I was there. There is little English spoken so knowing Spanish is a plus. There is only one plug to charge electronics and no table near the plug to put your laptop or pad so you can easily type on it while it is charging."
"We booked an individual room but when we came the bathroom was a sharing bathroom with other rooms  The bathroom is so small and dirty, the smell was reaching the room  It’s noisy, everything is falling down in the room and everywhere else  The staff service is inexistent  A lot of people are coming from outside of the hotel to go on tours in the lagoon   It’s definitly overpriced for what it is. When you go to bacalar you are not looking for this"
"Large and clean room, quiet. Nice access to the lagune at just 5 min. The lady running the place was adorable, and helped us when my friend was sick. Breakfast is good too, and there are lots of places to park."

 going on  at the hotel & outside road. This really damper on sleeping in.
"I found the staff here to be money hungry, no luggage room and the owner wasn’t too impressed when we asked where to store our luggage after checkout until our bus at 2pm. He said in the hall upstairs but if it wasn’t gone by 1.30pm we owed 35 pesos each. The hostel is outside of the town and about a 20/25 minute walk to anything, there should be bikes for free or at a cheap price. No breakfast included and the tents for camping are tiny. Once you check out there is only one outdoor shower for you to use wi"
"The hotel is small and cozy, 3 min walking to the lagoon. Small room but nice. Good wifi in room. They do they best to help and are always very kind. Breakfast is very good and a big plus. They offer kayaks for free for one hour (you just have to pay the lagoon tax at the dock)."
"We were two couples traveling through Quintana Roo and we all agreed staying here was one of the highlights of our trip. It is such a special place and we had a wonderful time.  The setting is beautiful, with the ""tubos"", the pool, the string lights, the decor, and all of the nice touches you find in every corner. The experience of staying in the tubo was awesome. The included breakfast was yummy.  Karla and Abi are the best hosts. Very nice and friendly, and very helpful with recommendations on things to d"
" Thank you, Kulu Tubohostel Bacalar! ""Se nos acabó la peseta"" for now, but hopefully we'll be back for more :-D"
Amazing spot for a quick getaway - The lagoon is a special place especially for sunrise/sunset and if you love to kayak...  Special shout out to Roberto as  was so helpful...  I really enjoyed my stay!  Thank you
…
"This place is absolutely beautiful! There are so many nice spaces to chill and enjoy the view to the best part of the lagoon: swings, hammocks, chairs, pallets. The restaurant is delicious and the service is excellent! The rooms are really nice and clean. One of the best hotels I have ever been in!"
"As mentioned in previous reviews, we had an uncomfortable stay due to a very closed, unfriendly, pretentious atmosphere. Most people there are volunteers or family members so we felt like intruders in their space!  Not friendly...not attentive at all.   Regarding booking, when we reserved a twin room we expected 2 beds but instead were welcomed with a double bed and sofa bed with no sheets.  First night there was no water.  Bit dirty in some communal areas and to get into the kitchen we had to pass the fami"
"Breakfast was good, the bedroom was clean.  Nice and helpful staff letting us using the kayak 1h30mins for free, and kind especially after I was beaten by a scorpion *be careful in the lagoon*   The hotel is a bit old and our two beds weren't comfy at all. I and my partner decided to sleep on the two beds instead of sharing one as they were actually both small.  The room wasn't big and the bathroom tiny, with the lavatory outside the bathroom, in the room.  Lots of dogs barking in the night around the hotel"

"First time for me in a hostel and I think this one is the coolest one, great ambience and service, the owner is so nice and attentive the place very quiet and also de bar is beautiful with a good vibe. And reasonable prices for very good quality, we loved it 😊😊😊"
"This resort is nestled in a lush and fertile jungle setting. Conveniently located off the 307 between Chetumal and Tulum, this tropical and inspired facility is an undiscovered gem and is an absolute paradise beckoning anyone looking for a peaceful and laid back visit with the gorgeous lagoon views, the Mexican sunrise, and a truly restorative vacation. The proprietor, Roberto, and his wife are gracious and welcoming hosts eager to share their slice of heaven with their guests. Roberto was a true host in ev"
"It's a shame to pay what they charge in front of the beautiful lagoon and suffer the noise of a choker motor all morning even when we asked them please to allow us to enjoy the silence in front of nature and they told us ""that's their working time"""
" give any information on where to go in the lagoon and didn't have a clue about us going around, so we ended up paddling randomly, missing important stops as people weren't able to give any information on where to go.  I would have rented the kayak somewhere else and this made me feel we paid a lot and the hotel is not even in front of the lagoon as it seems described on the profile.  Breakfast could be a bit richer and with more options for the overall price.  Parking is small, we had a tiny car and we wer"
…
 property itself is uniquely designed with villas that blend perfectly into the setting and contribute to the overall beauty. Every part of the facility is well cared for and spotlessly clean. There are covered decks with loungers which extend over the lagoon and allow for spectacular views.  I highly recommend trying this place. You won’t regret it.

"We went to this hotel based on recommendations we had read online. We wanted to use their access to the lagoon and eat and drink there.  When we got there the first impression was very hostile and impolite. Only after speaking to three other employees the front man was willing to give us access. We had to pay $300 in advance that we would have to consume as a minimum.  Once we were seated on the sun chair, they were cheap plastic ones, not the wooden ones in their pictures, a server brought us the menu for "
"The treatment was excellent, the staff very friendly and the food of our breakfast delicious, I would only recommend remodeling the terrace space and maintenance of your garden, I think it would be nicer if you put it nice!"
We stayed here for 1 night during our recent road trip around the Yucatan peninsula. It was really just an overnight stop on the journey from Calakmul to Mayakoba. The hotel is situated about 4 kilometres off the main highway down a bumpy dirt track. There was nobody at reception when we arrived and it took a few minutes to find somebody to check us in.  On the edge of the lake it should be a lovely tranquil spot but unfortunately on the afternoon we were there we had to put up with chain saws and hammering
" small and minimally furnished. There was no TV, no Aircon, no tea & coffee making facilities, no safe and little charm. In theory we booked a waterfront room but between our room and the water was a hedge, some palm trees and a man made area where all the sunbeds were situated so not exactly my definition of waterfront.  In theory WiFi is available in the central building but it wasn't working during our stay.  The best part of the stay from our perspective was first thing in the morning as the sun rose ov"
" at a table outside (which was covered in ants btw) we were told that we couldn’t sit there and hat to move inside. So we moved to a table inside. The service was horrible, rude and bored. Our server chose to play with a garment hanger instead of fetching our drinks from the bar although we could see that they were ready for 10 mins. The food we received was mediocre at best. My salmon noodles where cold when I got them and could have benefited from salt and pepper.  The desert (Oreo cheesecake) was still f"
"The good: the staff service, they are very warm! The bad: very noisy hotel, inside and in the surroundings... all day, all night. Could not sleep. The ugly: the hotel is announced as it was on the shores of the lagoon when in fact it is a block away."
"눉We did not manage to stay in this hotel since, despite the credit card left for guarantee for our reservation, when we arrived (2 Jan around 9pm, one hour later the expected) we found the room already assigned to another client, and had to find another accommodation with the help of the owner. It was a clear case of overbooking, but we have been debited for the first night (without having the possibility to get the room. The onwer argued that since she did not see us by 6pm, she assumed we wold not have ar"

…
"Rooms were very basic, but spacious and clean. No blankets so cold at night because aircondition is always difficult to get it right. Everybody was welcome to spend a day at the garden, tables and sun beds, so there was not enough room for the hotel guests to enjoy the location and chill.  Waiters were very rude and we had to wait for ages for a drink or some food. Even taking orders could take more then half an hour.  A lot of times we could not have a drink in the garden, for unknown reasons, even though "
"We booked the last room available and it was a little room with a fan and a balcony. The room was really small and with only a fan it was warm. But we knew what we booked and the room was clean, bed was comfortable and the balcony is a nice extra.  The staff was really friendly, helped us out with everything and we could kayak for one hour for free. Breakfast in the morning was good."
"Pros: Quiet, showers had hot water, clean, the staff was extremely friendly. Waitress Kathy came to take our dinner order while out in the lagoon so we could beat the crowd. Took care of us the rest of our stay too. All the staff made sure we were comfortable.   Cons: 30 mins away from town. Fortunately we had snacks, water, other drinks and our first aide kit. If not it probably would have not been good especially because the dirt road is extremely rough and takes about 10 mins or so to get to the hotel fr"
" only be accessed in the checkin/restaurant area. You had no cell service what so ever in your room. Only your own cell service in the lagoon area. Also take water shoes this part of the lagoon has rocks at the bottom and most definitely wouldn’t not go in without them.   Overall cute little place with your own private villa/ bungalow. It’s a great place if you want to have a romantic getaway.  I wouldn’t do a long stay, it is off the radar and eventually you’d want to go into town. But if you want to compl"
"Even when it is a little slow service (get used to it as it is common in the area) everything was just wonderful. Great view, wonderful foodm and drinks. The place is really good and we will be back as we really enjoyed."
"First off, Laguna Azul is an off-the-beaten-track/off-the-grid resort in a stunning setting with comfortable cabanas, well shaded camp sites, a great restaurant, and the beautiful Lake Bacalar just beyond the shore.  The central ""zocalo"" is shaded by numerous coconut trees and two palapas with tables, chairs, and hammocks.    Second off, Veronica, the owner, is a wonderful hostess.  I call her ""La Dama d' Hacienda"" or the ""Lady of the Manor.""  I say this because she wears many hats and she keeps everything "
…
" you want to do some sightseeing at an archeological site or see life in a traditional Mayan village, she will arrange that for you.  Then at night after she finishes up diner and cleans up, if you put some music on she will get everyone up to dance with her!    Up till now Laguna Azul has been a secret place known to people from Mexico City, campers, RV folks, some European and American travelers who wander in by chance or by mistake.  Once they get here though, they want to stay, recharge their batteries,"
We stayed at La Ceiba Hotelito on our second night in Bacalar. We wish we stayed both nights here. Very clean rooms with king beds and AC for a very reasonable 700 pesos. Very quiet place as there is no resterant/bar. You will have to go out for that. A short walk to town and the lagoon. Very friendly staff but very little English. Off street secure parking is available
…
"Los servicios son de mediana calidad, mejorar todos los aspectos ayudaria a llevar turismo de mejor posicion economica. Variar la oferta es buena opcion ya que la dia de hoy en su mayoria es para mochileros."
"We went for a day at the swimming holes at Bacalar and decided to stay the night, at a last minute we were searching place to drop by for the night with our 11 month old son and ended up here. Place was good rooms and bathroom was very clean which is a plus. However i couldn't get to adjust the AC seems it was programmed at 24 deg which on a hot summer night is just enough to get rid of humidity and excess heat. Other than that it is a very good place for the price. "
"Even though it was slow season,  hotel bacalar ...our favorite was full. We ended up at la ceiba, the room right in front of the office was cozy but the AC took a while to cool down the room. The shower was not too clean as i saw a bunch of hair on the shower floor. Apart from that everything else was good. "
"es realmente un pueblo magico, con el cenote azul tan bello y la laguna que es  maravillosa! espero que retiren las lanchas a motor que ensucian, contaminan y empobrecen la belleza del lugar! cuiden esa maravilla!"
"I love casa Morgan, it has a terassa facing the laguna with a stunning view. Nice communal room, in addition to a great cosy garden with hammock and a fire pit. I feel at home at casa Morgan, pepole here are awesome and its a perfect place to socialize and have fun."
"Arrived in Bacalar without a reservation and all of the hotels on the waterfront were booked. Found this place at the last minute. Staff was friendly and patient, rates were reasonable, room was clean and quiet with a strong AC and parking inside the courtyard. Close to everything. We were glad to find this place and stayed two nights."
"Si vas a Chetumal está es la playa más cercana está a 30 min es un lugar muy hermoso no se pueden perder este lugar lleven sandalias especiales de esas que se pueden meter a la alberca ya qué hay mucha piedra y ramas y la arena se siente como lodo pero bueno no nos incomodo esto, nos refrescamos muy a gusto y lo disfrutas un buen rato, es como una alberca gigante sin olas, no se pueden perder este paraíso. "
"un excelente lugar nos enamoramos de el, paseo por la laguna, nos llevaron a los cenotes, la gente muy amable, restaurantes con una gran variedad de alimentos cocina internacional, encuentras de todo un poco, un pueblo pequeño pero con todo lo necesario para pasar unas vacaciones fantásticas."
"best possible location right on the laguna. the hostel has a nice terrace with a view on the lagoon and a cute garden. friendly staff. it is loud even if there is no party here due to the neighboring bar. cool place nonetheless, recommended."
The hotel is really clean and it seems like it was built a week ago. Considering how little youre paying its worth staying a 5 minutes walk from the central square if you ask me. Also the people working there are really friendly and the rooms are cleaned every day!
"my husband and i were riding a motorcycle across Mexico and Lake Bacalar was one of our first stops after Tulum. And we just saw the sigh and it was late.. and we stayed couple more nights longer then expected. made fats friends with only other person staying there, walker across Yukatan and the owner, chef, tour guide - wonder woman Veronica. place is super basic, but if you're in for the nature with lake and unforgettable sunrises, and you are in because nature is amazing and who cares if the water pressu"
"We had such a wonderful stay here. The host is a freaking delight. The grounds are gorgeous, you can swim and kayak on a gorgeous lagoon that is private and serene. I can not say enough wonderful things about this place. If you are looking for a way to get away from the hustle and bustle and enjoy nature...this is the spot. My girlfriend and I will be back for sure. The highlight of our trip!"
"Stayed here for one night, showed randomly with no reservation. Was accomodated  in a shared room with bunk beds. Shared rooms are inside a wooden 'Cabin' with bunkbeds,  with a shared  terrace that offers side views of the lake. The location with access to the lake was great. Some kayak and SUP tours are available (took neither there).  Basic breakfast. I was really lucky as the one night I stayed I was the only person in the room. So, that really makes a difference.  The day I left, a large group arrived "
A nice place to stay located right in front of the laguna. Helpful staff and atypique house ! They give good advices and has a pretty nice terrace ! I definitely recommend this place to enjoy a quiet time
"Morgan House Hostel is a great option if you’re looking for a reasonably priced hostel in a prime location. A short walk to town center, the hostel doors open to a view of the lake right. Kayak and paddle board rentals are available right across the street.   The staff are super friendly and keep the place clean and organized. Kitchen area is equipped with everything you need to make your own meals.   Loud music at the bar next door can make it difficult for light sleepers.   There’s a beautiful deck on top"
Stanze davvero molto belle! Pulite grandi e moderne dotate di tv! Posizione perfetta a due passi dalla piazza dove ci sono ristoranti e bancomat. La piscina per un ultimo tuffo dopo una giornata in laguna è molto piacevole :-) colazione a pagamento ma davvero molto buona! Lo consiglio :-)
"Wir waren im Februar kurz da auf der Durchreise nach San Pedro Belize 🇧🇿 ( Das keine Reise wert war, Müll an allen Ecken und enden) Bacalar hingegen ist Wunderschön 😊, Mexico eben ein tolles Land. Die Menschen nett höflich und freundlich. Zumindest auf der Halbinsel, weiter sind wir noch nicht gekommen. Eine tolle risige Lagune mit tollem Wasser."
"Mis Casas is an excelent place to stay if you are looking for something quiet and sorrounded by nature. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay, so much that we have been there two times and we will probably go back!   One of the highlights is that Mis Casas has kayaks and water amenities that you can use for free! :)"
 walking distance/ a few blocks away of the Fort (Fuerte de San Felipe) and main square where many of the shops and restaurants/ cafes are located. Thanks . Gracias.
"Excellent hostel just nearby the lagoon! Everyone from the staff is really nice, you can buy cheap beer, rent a bike or just chill at the really cool rooftop with a view of the lagoon. There's a bar just next door with a really nice vibe and live music so for sure you will have fun also during the night 👌"
"wonderful service!! great people and vibs, clean beds and free small lockers for importent things, lights, ac and small fan for each bed. Clean toilet and great view to the laguna, 30 meters from her!   ."
"We had a fantastic “cottage” experience at Mis Casas...swimming off the dock into the  crystal clear, blue hued, warm lake, and surrounded by all the greenery of the jungle where we were treated to the sounds of many birds and creatures. Kayak trips in the lake and into small river systems were magical. Comfortable accommodations with so many windows and sky lights, giving a feeling of being outdoors. The palapa with BBQ and full kitchen facilities provided long evenings of meals, drinks, and conversation. "
…
"A beautiful place for everything: lazy days, Fiestas and Nature is just a Stone throw away. The people who are running it are friendly and always up for a Chat. Right beside is a bar with great live music nearly every evening."
"Cute hostel right at the lagoon in Bacalar. The hosts are super nice, they offer fun tours and bikerental. Beautiful rooftop and garden, very familiar atmosphere. Very cheap price for such a nice place!"
 also has an excellent recipe for margaritas! The stay was truly a wonderful adventure.
We didn’t stay at this hostel but we booked their sailing tour around the lagoon and it was amazing. They offer three tours a day and we did the evening tour 3-6:30pm and it was nothing short of perfect. Everything was so relax and although I was the only traveller who spoke English they translated as much as they could for me. We stopped at all the major sights in the lagoon where we could swim and take pictures. This was such a relaxing trip around the lagoon of 7 colours I would highly recommend it for a
"Such a lovely hostel right by the lagoon! Breakfast is basic but good, has a super nice rooftop with a good view to chill on and staff are friendly and helpful. Loved my stay here, would definitely stay again :)"
…
The place is decent  but noisy not confortable  no locker in the room  no toilet in the room... mattresses rolled in plastic wrap (very uncomfortable) And they charge 15€/17usd for a bed in a dorm!Terrible quality/price ratio.Should cost half at least.
"Had to check out at 9pm when I was told the restaurant next door becomes a club / bar at night and the really loud music would not stop until 2am, maybe 3.   Totally impossible to sleep.  Ok place with nice staff. Very bad mattress.  Don't expect any sleep before 2am here!"
"Mis Casas offers nature lovers a wonderful retreat in the heart of the jungle. If you love listening to the birds, watching fish moving through the water, kayaking adventures and swimming in crystal clear water then Mis Casas is the perfect place for your next getaway. Kathryn is a wonderful hostess and has a wealth of knowledge about the area that she is eager to share. Mis Casas is a lovely place to spend time getting disconnected from technology while connecting with your family and friends."
"I'm not picky about where I stay so enjoyed my stay based on the water front location and it's proximity to the square, in terms of how the hostel is run it's a pretty terrible operation. There was diarrhea for three days in two of three toilets found outside and a terrible smell of dog in the other set of toilets, staff are unhelpful, none I met could speak any English and pretty sure one is high all the time. You pay a lot of money to stay here yet have to pay every time to fill your water and when I aske"
"Had a wonderful two weeks, lodged in the privacy of ""Tinker"".  We enjoyed full access and use of the central screened-in palapa, replete with kitchen, dining table and most inviting hammock.  Relaxing in the beauty of the jungle and gardens, together with swimming in picturesque Laguna Bacalar from Mis Casas' docks was lovely and refreshing.  The mix of independent living and management's care and support was ideal.  Mis Casas is ideally situated to offer a nice mix of outings to Pueblo Bacalar, Chetumal, M"
"I LOVED Bacalar so it kept me from realizing at first the issues this place has. There are currently two dogs there in dire need of veterinary car and, more simply, a bath. They smell terrible and at least one always likes to hang out in the bathroom. So you get to smell dog smell while you're in the bathroom. One was in there when I took a shower. It was gross. One is bleeding from its paw and drips blood everywhere. They both have open sores and scratch all the time (obviously flea-ridden). The staff was "
"My third time to visit.  An exceptionally relaxing and renewing destination. The jungle tone is maintained. The Lake of Seven Colours is a beautiful limestone, underground, fed lake that is wonderful to be on, in or viewing. Mis Casas is clean, well appointed with all utensils for cooking and self sufficiency. Katarina is instructive and able to be helpful or part of the background. She is knowledgeable about the ecological area and the local tourist attractions. A real bonus is the common area  palapa whic"
" stand it. It wasn't filthy but it was way too dirty for my taste and I'm not very picky. Hair on the floor, mud, dirty toilet etc.  Great things: location - right on the lagoon and close to the center of town; staff - very friendly and helpful."
"Set into the jungle with lake front, Mis Casas is a beautiful and friendly little piece of paradise. The lake is a turquoise beauty to swim, kayak and canoe. Accomodations blend in with nature, are comfortable, large and beautiful. A haven for the senses."
"Loved finding a place that welcomed my children and dog while needing to leave our home to evacuate for a hurricane. We did not want to leave and will be back soon for a proper vacation. Wifi was great, AC worked amazing, quiet and beautiful. Kids loved exploring and jumping off see ock into the water. Marissa was amazing with booking us in a crazy state and welcoming us in later that same day. Very accommodating!"

"We had the best time!! The garden and the Laguna are amazing...and Pedro was so helpful and made our stay even more enjoyable. ""El cielo"" is an apartment full of art (Yolanda is a very talented painter) and with a stunning view. We could not believe all the lovely details in the apartment and having THIS TERRACE. The place is too wonderful to make trips to other places. Just stay in the water and enjoy nature's beauty! The town of Bacalar is cute, too with some lovely breakfast and dinner places. Since a co"
"This is glamping-at-its-best. We keep coming back to this jungle oasis for so many reasons, and we are always amazed that it's always better than we remember. We come here because there are minimal modern services and yet we still get flush toilets, hot showers, easy cooking facilities, and canoes or kayaks to rent. In exchange for turning off our cell phones and laptops, we get an intimate up close experience of the friendliest jungle, multiple daily swims in the soft clean lake water, warmth and kind welc"
"With my family, we rented one of Ginny's villas for 2 weeks. It was gorgeous. The lake is beautiful, calm, the plants and flowers produce a stunning view we could enjoy from the balcony. Down the stairs, we had access to a palapa to feel the breeze, swim and relax in a hammock. The kids enjoyed the kayaks. Ginny and her team are most welcoming, always willing to help. Ginny also has a treasure library of thousands of DVDs we could borrow to watch movies at night. The villa is comfortable. There is everythin"
"Where to begin to describe our visit to Pehaltun. Ginny was an incredible host who was so flexible and accommodating. In fact, we were supposed to stay elsewhere but unfortunately our host was unwell, however our original hosts got in touch with Ginny to ask if we could stay. Last minute, she let us stay in her house, which was super comfortable and Ginny made us feel so at home as if we'd known each other for years.   Furthermore, Ginny has some of the best recommendations for places to eat in Bacalar. On "
Great sup activity with monkey sup! Im looking forward to the pictures. Nice view and sightseeing during te tour. Breakfast afterwards with fruit bread and marmelade. Highly recommend to all travelers  Gr. Evie
"I was there with my family, and I most say: it is a wonderful place to go for relax, recover, family time, and if it is the case, romantic. We had two apartments with everything needed, specially for cooking. The decoration and the small details over the place were perfect. One of the apartments had a huge terrace were we had breakfast, saw the sunrise and the moon: Also the space for cooking and eating inside was perfect and with a lot of space. One must be clear that this place is not a luxury hotel, you "

" out that you could dive off the dock and you can also chill  in the hammocks to cool off from the Mexican heat. Ginny also put us in touch with some amazing people from the community who were able to take us wake-boarding.

You even have access to the canoes and kayaks which Ginny has on the property, we decided to take the canoe out on many occasions for a sunrise paddle and even to El Rancho's for lunch which is "

For me, it was a great place to recover, the owners gave us perfect privacy and they gave us support and tips for everything we needed. We could have massage sessions there with really good massage therapist from the region. And the possibility of temazcal was there. Last but not least.

"We rented the penthouse with king bed.  Extremely spacious with extra queen bed, dining table and sitting area.  Very large sun deck overlooking the magical lagoon.  Private dock and no close neighbors....perfect for a swimsuit optional swim in the most gorgeous water that you have ever experienced. The owners are very hospitable and for a small fee, they serve you breakfast and dinner in your suite.  Feels like you are staying at your own home.   It's an eco friendly property with solar lights and plenty o"
"Llegamos después del medio día, y nos entregaron nuestra habitación al momento. La vista es hermosa. prestan kayaks sin cargo. Lo único que le falta es un pequeño servicio de Café en la mañanas. Pero todo en si es muy lindo. Las habitaciones no tiene TV, y eso es perfecto, así puedes disfrutar del lugar. Es un lugar pequeño y muy privado. Regresaremos sin dudar al mismo lugar :D"
"Marina IzaVela se encuentra en la ribera de la Hermosa Laguna, tiene su propio muelle y te permiten usar sus kayaks sin costo adicional. Las Vistas de la Laguna son excelentes. Si buscas un sitio económico para admirar la belleza del entorno, tener tranquilidad y disfrutar de la Laguna paseando en Kayak, nadando o contemplándola este es el lugar."
"This was the most beautiful place we stayed at during our road trip around Mexico. So peaceful and relaxing but with your own car you are in downtown Bacalar within minutes. Beautiful garden, your own dock and hammocks down by the lake, a terrace overlooking the turquoise water and a stylish „villa“ with everything you need for a pleasant stay. Ginny is a charming and generous host who helped us a lot when our baby got sick. This is probably the best option when in Bacalar! "
"La frase más trillada es ""sentirse cómo en casa"", pero aquí en verdad te sientes recibido por un familiar. Es cómodo, limpio, barato, la atención es de primera. Y la familiaridad es lo mejor. Hasta platicamos con la dueña como si fuéramos amigos de años. No está sobre la orilla de la laguna pero no lo necesita. La vista desde la terraza es preciosa. Cómo todo está cerca en el pueblo, puedes llegar caminado desde la carretera, si viajas en ADO o puedes pedir un taxi. Llegarías en 10 minutos máximo. Si traes "
 slow.   Bring a cooler with ice and your favorite drinks and snacks as there is no freezer here.  No problem though.....we enjoyed making our own martinis every night.

"El lugar es totalmente recomendado para estar tranquilo y disfrutar la belleza de la laguna. En esta zona donde se ubica Marina IzaVela, la laguna tiene especial encanto porque no es tan profunda.  El paseo en velero es imperdible (mejor q hacerlo en lancha de motor!!!!!!!). Marina IzaVela es ideal para descansar, estar en contacto con la naturaleza y olvidarse de todo. Si buscas estar viviendo la laguna y sentirte en paz y tranquilidad, este es el lugar adecuado!!!"

"Pehaltun I placed 4km outside the town in the jungle.  Pehaltun is not a luxurious place but the place is absolutely fantastic and the host, Ginny, is very caring and friendly.   We stayed here for 1 week with our children (3 and 6yr).  We loved the privacy and nature that this place had to offer.  Go to the lake in the morning for a morning swim while enjoying your coffee and the Magnificat sunrise.   Pehaltun got my best recommendation. "
" poquitas habitaciones así que reserva con tiempo para asegurar tu estancia. La gente lo conoce y lo recomienda y así llegué a esa maravilla ""escondida"". "
"I second everything the below review said. We experienced a very unclean location (staying also in El cielo) when we complained about the lack of hot water the owner got very nasty. This is not a place you want to stay at, and certainly not pay for your stay. They cover all the defects up by saying it is eco friendly but in reality it is an amateurish set up, badly maintained by people who are just out for your money. They have 2 chihuahuas that yelp day and night. For internet use we were told by their son"
"Having read all the positive reviews we were super excited about our stay at Casa Aqabal. Unfortunately we knew had made a mistake from the moment we arrived.   The road to the property is dodgy and difficult to get down, but it's not impossible if you drive slowly and do it in day light. Just be aware that you're pretty far from the town and any shops so arrive fully stocked and happy to stay stationary for your whole stay.   Yes, Yolanda and Pedro seem like the loveliest hosts, greeting you with big smile"
"Our stay in Villa Pehaltun was amazing. My husband booked a 3 night stay in the Palapa for our family . The view from the Palapa is gorgeous and fortunatly it was a bit windy during our stay so the breeze kept the Palapa fresh 24/7. We would get up very early every morning to go to Bacalar local produce market to get fresh fruit and other goodies, go back to the villa and have our private breakfast in our terrace. The view is breathtaking so we thought it would have been a shame to not use it. Our hosts Lis"

" nights sleep either of us have ever experienced. The room was invested with endless giant ants and flying beetles. With no mosquito net & the electricity cutting out (hence the tiny fan above the bed not working ), sleeping was an impossibility.  To add to this, the entire property felt very unclean & uncomfortable. Very dusty and covered in dead insects.   Yes the meals are good but not mind blowing like others have mentioned. Plus they only offer you water, so pretty expensive for a simple home cooked me"

The dock us very nice and we were lucky to be the only ones in the Villa for the first 2 days so it was just for the 3 of us and even after that, we never crashed into the other guests because their are always other things to do. Sunrises are amazing a if you go a bit further in with the kayaks or canoe you get to see the sunset, just majestic.

"El hotel se encuentra a unas 10 cuadras de la laguna y eso lo hace un lugar muy tranquilo, pero con todos los servicios necesarios bien cerca.

"Fatal, hice una reservación 10 días antes de viajar, pagada y confirmada por Airbnb y el establecimiento. Tan solo 2 días antes de viajar me cancelaron sin ninguna explicación y sin ninguna opción de protección. Tengan cuidado con este tipo de hoteles, reserven establecimientos serios y plataformas más profesionales. No arriesguen sus vacaciones!!!"
"Todo perfecto en Casitas Bacalar, desde el desayuno a la limpieza pasando por el estilo minimalista de la casa de gran gusto. David es un anfitrión perfecto que te ayuda a disfrutar de una excelente estancia en la laguna. Super recomendado! "
"The view and ambiance were stunning. Our meal was delicious (had the flautas rice dessert)  service was impeccable. We had a few drinks and the famous blue beer, all were great. Would definitely recommend."
"Este pequeño y acogedor hotel cuenta con el servicio más cálido y hospitalario que puedas encontrar en Bacalar, la limpieza es impecable y tiene el mejor precio garantizado. ¡Nosotros lo disfrutamos enormemente! Nos procuraron en todo y nos atendieron de maravilla.  Lagon Bleu fue nuestra decisión más inteligente."
"No están justo en la laguna pero están muy cerca. De hecho todo queda cerca en Bacalar. Esta opción es inmejorable en relación calidad precio, ademas, aceptan mascotas. Tienen lugar de estacionamiento y sus cabañas están muy bien equipadas con Refri, aire acondicionado, ventilador, baño completo, calentador eléctrico de agua, wifi, y una mesita. El jardín está muy bonito. Los anfitriones son muy amables. El lugar se siente muy seguro. "
"Es un lugar muy bonito vista a la laguna , tienen cayac que fue de las cosas que disfrute mucho , es un lugar trankilo para relajarse ,el desayuno muy rico y variado exelente servicio nos encantó mucho "
"Hace unos meses se nos dio a mi y a mis amigos la oportunidad de viajar a bacalar, nos hospedamos en estas hermosas cabañas, totalmente confortables, un lindo jardín, las camas están super cómodas y los baños totalmente relucientes, y los mejor de todo es que es un lugar donde se aceptan mascotas, es un lugar totalmente maravilloso para aquellas personas o parejas que buscan un lugar de relajación este es el lugar ideal 😍"
The beautiful lagoon of Bacalar.  It's long 4 hours drive from playa but it's worth it.  Take a tour boat with swimming in the lake.  Than relax with lunch in a small hostel.  This area is still beautiful and untouched by massive tourism.  Beautiful place. 
"Excelente opción para los que buscan la tranquilidad y conectar con la naturaleza. En plan romántico está genial. El acceso a la laguna es privado y directo. La atención excelente, siempre al pendiente y nos apoyaron con varias recomendaciones de paseo y comida. Buenas promociones."
"Nos hospedamos con ellos el del día 22 al 24 de junio Todo estaba bien precio y lugar   Pero la noche del domingo para amancer lunes entraron a robar a nuestro cuarto con nosotros adentro, por fortuna no nos dimos cuenta  Pero perdimos nuestras pertenencias, lo peor de todo es que iba con mi esposa y mi hijo de menos de 1 año Por fortuna no nos dimos cuenta y no paso de lo material Al parecer el ladron o ladrones entraron por la ventana ya que esta no tiene seguro para poder cerrarse por dentro También  tra"
"Great views, friendly people and really great place to relax. You can be social or just by your self. We stayed there couple of days during our trip from Belize to Playa del Carmen and the lake view and kayaking were just the things that made our trip perfect. This place is not in the center but taxis are very cheap and you can also walk if you have time and good shoes. Couple of times the water run out but there is plenty of clear water in the lake ;)"
"Far from town but nice spot,  friendly hosts.  No ac but breeze was nice.  View from room was amazing.  Wish we had more time to spend here. No keys were given to lock the room when you left but we didn't feel that was necessary as everyone was very nice and the place had a locked gate. "
If you stay here you can expect a family owned business with nice staff and cute rooms with thatched roof. Unfortunately the cabanas dont offer a beach front or access to the water. Breakfast could be ordered for some extra pesos. If you stay here a car would be an advantage since the place is a little outside from bacalar and places to eat/drink are 5 car min away 
"This is a quiet spot about 10 mins walk down a very main busy road before getting to the outskirts of Bacalar. It is a small, family run establishment. Staff were friendly, helpful and patient. There were amazing views of this stunningly beautiful lake and the cabanas were very cute. Breakfast was done to order in the morning. Factor in the cost of taxis when booking, as it is not a nice walk to town plus there is little to do at the cabanas during the evening. It is a pretty and peaceful place to rest up."
"The hotel is somewhat far away from downtown Bacalar, making it necessary to take a $30-50 peso taxi each time you need to move. There are no nearby restaurants or stores. It is too secluded from Bacalar. The attention from the owners is ok, nothing too special. Breakfasts are expensive if you take cost-benefit in consideration."
"El hotel iguana rana está en segunda línea frente a la laguna, al lado del cenote cocalitos, que es genial para ir a pasar la tarde, y del cenote azul. El hotel está nuevo, las habitaciones son muy grandes y tienen TV con Netflix. Además la Wifi funciona fenomenal (que en muchos alojamientos de Yucatán no hay manera de que funcione bien). Limpio y muy correcto. Lo recomiendo totalmente. "
"Me encantó, limpio, seguro, excelente atención muy tranquilo, cerca de la laguna, agradecida con la atención y amabilidad, muy recomendable, ambiente familiar, volveré con muchísimo gusto, gran experiencia, gracias por todo."
"Fue un viaje de pareja y la pasamos fenomenal es la primera vez que vamos a Bacalar y nos encantó!! El hotel queda bastante accesible a cocalitos con una playa fenomenal, la habitación cumple su función limpia y cómoda y con buena vista a la laguna, con gusto regresaremos "
"Un lugar donde te brindan, calidez, amabilidad y comodidad, la Señora Selene es una persona muy amable que te hace sentir como en casa. Lo recomiendo ampliamente por su precio y calidez sin duda alguna es un lugar donde vale la pena llegar "
"Este Hotel aún cuando es pequeño, cubre las expectativas de un viajero que busca un lugar para descansar. Las razones? 1. Ubicación: a 3 cuadras del centro, a dos cuadras para tomar el tour a la laguna. 2. Limpieza: muy buena y me encantó que en estos tiempos de retorno a la actividad por el Covid, tienen buenas prácticas de higiene. La habitación fue sanitizada y tienen constancia de la misma. Blancos de la habitación limpios. Habitación: Óptimo tamaño, TV sin problema de señal, espacios para acomodar la r"
"La calidez del servicio y el ambiente del hospedaje es único, son muy amables en general, te hacen sentir muy cómodos, las habitaciones son muy acogedoras y en general el hotel es muy cómodo respecto a su precio esta muy accesible y vale la pena lo recomiendo ampliamente.. Por su puesto que regresaría aquí ☺️"
" habitación. Estaba limpio.  Áreas de oportunidad para mejorar: Colocar por lo menos una botella de agua o un dispensador en una área común. Cambiar el shampoo, la mitad se desperdicia. Tener un formato más en forma para registrarse, da seguridad al huésped.  Sin duda, si lo recomiendo!"

"Everyone seemed very nice Our room was cleaned everyday. Mu daughter made friends with the housekeeper.   We did pick this location bec., of the fruit available in the morning. It was nothing like the picture. We got a banana or a apple, and some toast.  Other hotels did not offer this. We were disappointed,  Tea was amazing!"
This is a cute hotel with big rooms 10 minutes from the center. The tasty breakfast is Müsli with tropical fruit and some toast with Marmelade. Unfortunately there’s no fridge in the rooms but the staff is very friendly and helpful. We booked a lagoon tour via the hotel and had a nice tour of 2 hours with pickup from the hotel.  The water was always warm and there are fans and aircon in the rooms. 
"When we arrived at this hotel to check in, we were more than a little disappointed at the appearance of the hotel from the street. However, once we got situated, we found it to be a great little hotel.  It's not beach-front, and is a fairly good walk to the town center, but other than its' location, the Moon Lagoon is a wonderful spot to spend your lodging pesos. We found it to be exceptionally clean and all of the staff that we had occasion to interact with were friendly, attentive, and handled all of our "
" half the cost of other tour companies in Bacalar.  The rooms are also very reasonably priced, at less than $40 USD per night."
…
"We booked two night here for us and some friends. We knew it wasn’t on the lagoon, however it was lacking so much more than that. The rooms are simple, that would be fine if the water worked, if it didn’t have huge gaps between the door and the floor. Only a sheet and two pillows, I need a blanket as my husband likes the room cold, the ac took forever to get working as well. The kicker, we decided we wanted to be on the water as getting access can be difficult, so we booked another hotel, we had already pai"
el hotel calma Es muy lindo en realidad no es un hostel es como una casa que lo transformaron en el hostel los chicos son unos argentinos y un israelí  y está bueno tiene un desayuno copado y tiene salida la laguna eso está bueno Y también puedo descansar en en unas camas paraguayas. tiene un desayuno normal pero está bueno son como unas tostadas con café y fruta y huevo.
"El mejor lugar u muy practico, muy liMuy buen lugart!!!!  limpio y funcional todo!!   la mejor atencion!!! cerca del centro, moderno, limpio, y una atencion excelente!!...muy recomendado....volvere, con todda la familia!!!"
es muy buena ubicación para todos los espacios recreativos ya que todo está cerca y accesible me gusto para estar con mis hijos y muy buen precio. es muy recomendable y acogedor  el servicio es muy bueno y está muy limpio
"We were going to a wedding in a small town inside from Bacalar  and there was no place to stay, we had no car and we needed a place to get a shower and get ready.  They don't take credit cards they have room with AC for $600 pesos and with a sealing fan for  $400 pesos   I should not complain it had 2 king size beds,AC and shower with warm water.   It has many rooms and a swimming pool. You need a car to move around here if you go far taxis will try to charge a lot.  Decided not to take pics. "
Nous avons dormi à l'hôtel Dana Express dans la nuit du 22 au 23 février 2014 et en avons tiré une grande satisfaction.  L'hôtel peut sembler être un motel de passe au premier coup d'œil mais il n'en est rien. L'omniprésence de la couleur rose de l'endroit peut porter à confusion à ce sujet.  L'hôtel est à environ 3 km du centre-ville sur la route principale qui mène à Chetumal en venant de Limones.  Il est sur votre gauche si vous venez de cette direction et il est impossible de le manquer.  Ce n'est pas u
"On a adoré l’accueil de la famille, adorable ! Ce camping est très bien placé, les matelas dans les tentes confortables et propres.  Seul petit bémol, le bruit dans la rue ainsi qu’à l’intérieur. Mais on a quand même passé un super moment ! "
"Die Lage ist hervorragend, nur 4 min. zu Fuß von der Lagune entfernt. Der Campingplatz ist der Vorhof einer sehr lieben, bemühten Familie. Wir wurden gleich mit Kaffee empfangen, den wir gemütlich bei einem Gitarrenständchen trinken konnten und das Zelt wurde uns auch aufgebaut.  Die Zelte sind nicht schlecht und mit dünnen Matratzen ausgelegt, welche überraschend bequem waren. Auch die Sanitären Anlagen waren ok.  Kleiner Kritikpunkt war das Frühstück, welches für das Geld recht bescheiden war. Auch der Ho"
"Excelente opción para sentirte en casa... Adecuada área de cámping, la familia sencilla, tiene  todo para dormir, bañarte, y céntrico ambiente relajado y tranquilo, por una cantidad de 30 pesos incluye desayuno casero"
"Para empezar Bacalar es un lugar bello, cuenta con su laguna de 7 colores, el fuerte de san Felipe, el trato amable por parte de su anfitrión es lo que cambia todo, te recomienda lugares para visitar, para comer, aparte de que te dejan al alcance el mapa de Bacalar, es super limpio, habitaciones amplias a pesar de que fuimos 4 personas y sobre todo económico, estuvimos buscando lugares para estar pero todos rebasan el presupuesto, estamos esperando regresar!"
"We had a great stay with Ximbal Camping. We originally booked in for one night but decided to stay an extra night.   The tents are great and come with everything you need.(We grabbed another two mats for comfort). There were just 6 tents so it was quiet at night and not over crowded.  They offer breakfast, pancakes with fresh fruit or eggs/toast also with fruit. Really nice food.  Its only a 2 min walk to the main square and 5min walk to the Laguna.  The family are lovely too!"
"We were looking for a place to find the stromatolites and accidentally ended up at Panto-Ha... and stayed three nights, 7 kilometres from Bacalar towards Chetumal, at the end of a 1200 metres dirt road (allow 10 minutes by car). This location is a paradise, in the forest, directly at the Laguna. Three cabins are available for 400 pesos/night each. No power (except for lights till about 10 pm from a generator), no running water (except for the - clean - communal toilets). The cabins offer two double beds, sp"
"Estuve hospedado en Bacalar en Casa Coral, la amabilidad de Rodo fue extraordinaria, te ofrecen tours, opciones de desayuno, almuerzo, cena, etc. Si quieres descansar esta es tu mejor opción, te tratan como en casa, hacen parrilladas familiares y lo más importante es que son Petfriendly :D sin duda regreso!!"
"Stayed one night, aircon, w/ simple breakfast, safe, clean sheets, very friendly staff, some mosquitos in the room, very easy to reach (by foot) from the bus station. Maybe not to stay for long, but great and affordable stopover."
 Il manque un pdj complet. Pas de thé que du cafe Emplacement bon. Laverie à proximite. Parking voiture. Restauration sympa et abondante à la pina  puis faire tour de cenote azul e' y allant ar derrière petit sentier gratuit 
"We were supposed to stay in a room with lake view at Casa Ichkabal. This was not available once we arrived, which can happen of course. We asked the receptionist if we could still cancel, cause we wanted to look for a hotel that did have a room at the lake - which is the main reason people visit Bacalar. 'Yes' he said, and free of charge. We left, booked another hotel and waited for the cancellation. This never happened, a refund was never received, the hotel didn't reply to all our emails and is not pickin"
"We hebben dit hotel in eerste instantie niet geboekt, maar door een fout van een ander hotel waren we verplicht om 1 nacht hier te slapen. De kamers waren ontzettend smerig! De muren waren bedekt met schimmel en de geur in de kamer was niet uit te houden, zelfs bedlinnen rook alsof het jaren niet gewassen was. We hebben een verschrikkelijke nacht gehad. Nadat we hier over hebben geklaagd heeft de manager van het hotel het op een verkeerde en niet professionele manier afgehandeld, en zeker niet opgelost. We "
"La verdad mi experiencia en este hotel no fue de lo mejor, hice una reserva de una cama en habitacion compartida. Cuando llegue alla la cama era una colchoneta que estaba arriba de los baños de la habitacion.  El agua pesima, no funcionaba el pozo que tienen al parecer por lo que los olores de los baños no eran lo mas agradables"
"Hotel ??????   Malísimo ni se les ocurra contratar, no hay recepción , como tal , el precio $ 1.400 por noche , 3 días para pagar con la terminal y nos exigían pagar en efectivo , , vivimos en Cancún hace 30 años  y estamos muy decepcionados , ya estando en Bacalar encontramos mejores opciones , las puertas  no funcionan las herraduras ,, desde la entrada el lugar sucio y descuidado , la alberca vacía y sucia , a la vista basura con envases de cerveza ,al fondo parece una vecindad descuidada , que horror , "
"We had a two night reservation at this hotel and left after the first night. Of course, no reimbursement.  The hotel is falling apart, it’s very obvious that no maintenance has been done in long time in common areas.  Rooms are full of mold in walls, ceiling, blinds, bathroom. A noisy pump keeps you awake all night... Breakfast is supposed to be served at 9am... did not happen.  The pictures in the add are absolutely deceiving. Please don’t go to this hotel."
"Выбрал этот отель, т.к. около озера все были заняты. От воды далековато – 2-3 мин. пешком, но рядом с центральной площадью.  В самом отеле условия неплохие – много зелени, большой номер, единственное неудобство – туалет не в номере, а рядом – нужно пройти по дорожке. Душ есть, горячая вода тоже. В номере – вентилятор.  Доброжелательный персонал, тихо, единственное – птицы орут иногда.  Платил 300 песо в новогодний сезон.  Да, ещё там большая влажность – за ночь ничего не высохло. Впрочем, напрямую к отелю э"

However, when we arrived, with reservations made several months in advance, we found out that the owner had passed away, and his wife and children had moved away.  There was no water in the little pool.  The staff was friendly and the rooms still looked fine, but we decided to go to a different hotel.

The building looks new but the entire few blocks around are in total decay.  Also, I know the hotel cant help all the dogs around, but if I had a hotel in a neighbourhood were 20 dogs would howl and bark all night (litteraly, ALL NIGHT), I would go for a bit thicker walls and double glass so they dont keep you up all night (besides"

Nos permitieron usar el refri y los platos, etc. Los cuartos están muy sencillos y agradables. Lo único que no me gustó tanto es que el ventilador de mi habitación no tenía bastante potencia (Lo que es muy malo en temporada de calor) y que el agua de la regadera no saliera con buena presión.

This is a new hotel even though the name says apartments. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The shower has plenty of pressure. I was surprised by the water spigot instead of a nicer water spout being a new hotel. That wasn't a deal breaker. The room was nice and well lit. Very bright rooms. The rooms were also very clean.
"Me and my partner stayed at this hotel. We enjoyed a quiet and calm time here, the hotel is right on the water to the lovey lagoon with beautiful views. There are a few different hang out spots so people can spread out and it felt like we had the space to our selves. The food at the hotel is great and at a reasonable price for hotel food. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED The  shrimp tacos, suuuuper yummy. The cocktails are also delicious and they don’t hold back in the alcohol.  The staf are friendly, kind and helpful. T"
Laura is very dishonest and hungry for money. I stayed a night and I see how she is constantly accusing someone of missing things and monitoring her cameras. She is disgusting person who cares only about money and when I checked out she insisted the deposit of 500 pesos goes to her employees which she refused to return.   She will find ways to keep your deposit. whether from her bike or kayak or towels.  It is sad and she complaints about her employees stealing from her.
"Las cabañas muy bien, cerca del lago con embarcadero privado. Lo que lo estropeó todo fue que hay un motor alternador que se conecta por la noche y da luz por la noche en todo el recinto, imposible dormir. Nos tocó dormir en las cabañas de al lado del motor, si van a ir recen para que no os toquen esas cabañas. No lo recomiendo si quieres dormir tranquilo. Por el precio que es hay mejores alternativas.  El personal y servicio muy agradable.  "
"The hotel could be a gem if the owner cared about renovating or refurbishing it. The rooms need to be redone, get rid of the ants that are everywhere! the public areas are sad and need to be gutted and redesigned.  The hotel has incredible potential but lacks ""care"".  The only thing good was the actual A/C in the room.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"I will start by saying this hotel was pretty good in cancelling my reservation and returning all my money except for one night stay. I am rating them a 2 star because the rooms are not what they appear online and have some mis-information and was an overly run down place we found.  For example when i did the booking on booking.com, it stated a king size bed. The picture showed this beautiful room with lots of room and a view and private balcony. This was not the case as only room has a king and it was not o"
"Our experience with this establishment was less than pleasant. I inquired on a Sunday about the policy for no children ages 0-12 listed in the house rules. I have found that many of the hostels list this option because they do not want babies/toddlers  in the dorms and the option is an all/nothing choice given by Airbnb to hosts. As I suspected my 9 year old daughter was welcome in the hostel as indicated by the message we received back from the hostel the following morning. They stated they ""we will be wai"
" Bacalar around 1600. We quickly grabbed a bite to eat and headed to the hostel. I sent my mother and 3 children ahead in a taxi and my husband and I walked it from the bus station (1.9 miles). Upon arrival to the hostel (around 17: 30)  we were informed that our reservation has ""been cancelled"". When we asked why we were given no explanation - not ""we overbooked, miscommunication, etc."" just a simple ""your reservation was cancelled"". They pointed in either direction and said there are hostels on this road "
es un hotel no muy grande con excelente atencion y que te hacen sentir que estas en casa ademas con el acceso a la laguna no hay mas que pedir porque hay pocos como este y es muy facil llegar ademas de que esta muy cerca del centro y de la fortaleza que tiene muy bien cuidada que son los atractivos mas famosoa del lugar
" air conditioner leaks and drops water, which around the A/C and on the floor was mold everywhere. The shelves were dirty, dust, spider webs everywhere, not the romantic setting i was looking for.  We also noticed in the walk to the room, dirt, dust, and dead flies everywhere. Not just from an overnight, but seems like no attention has been given by anyone, not sure what the cleaners are doing besides making the beds. Between the owner, manager, cleaning staff, front desk, and a guy trying to sell us tours,"
"Es un hotel modesto pero agradable, el personal es amable y te orienta para que disfrutes la estancia en es laguna inigualable y hermosa. Y hace honor a su nombre porque desde el hotel se tiene una vista privilegiada de una gran parte de la laguna de los siete colores."

We went to the hostel to rent paddel surf tables. They were very nice with us and they were looking for us all the time. The people here is very relaxed and welcoming. We didn't stay there to sleep however the services we had were very very nice! Thank you guys!
"è una sorta di motel, con camere veramente spaziose e con un bagno tutto sommato niente male, è vicinissimo alla stazione degli autobus ADO, per noi fondamentale visto che abbiamo girato lo yucatan con i mezzi pubblici...in 15 minuti di camminata si arriva alla laguna e poco vicino c'è un bellissimo baretto ed una lavanderia molto utile... wifi non male e servizio escursioni con buon prezzo..

Free bikes, kayak, resting chairs and television. We got to put on a movie and made some popcorn for the crowd. Staff really nice - one fluent in English - try their best and involve you a lot.

"A group of friends and I booked this hostel unsure of what to expect. After two nights we were having such an amazing time we canceled our travel plans and extended our stay. The dock and hammocks made a perfect quiet place to relax. The kayaks and paddle boards provided hours of free entertainment. The free bikes were a fun way to get into town for food.  The rooms were spotless clean! The staff is on 24/7, and incredibly accomadating.  If you are considering this hostel, STAY HERE, you'll thank me later. "
"Me gusta porque las habitaciones son aseadas y las camas cómodas, el hotel cuenta con un personal que atiende muy bien, son muy amables y muy pacientes. Y dobre todo me gusta también por su ubicación."
"l'hotel si trova a pochi passi dalla stazione ADO di bacalar e quindi comodo per spostarsi per la riviera maya...camere basilari ma con letti enormi, pulite e molto spaziose. Jesus alla reception è stato molto disponibile e ci ha lasciato tenere una stanza oltre il check out per i nostri zaini mntre eravamo in giro ino a sera."
Hotel genre motel le long d'une grosse route. Sans ame. Piscine certes mais pas engageante. Genre relais routier plus qu'hotel. Propre mais sommaire.  Se situe a 1km de la pkace principale de Bacalar. Pas de possibilite de petit dejeuner.
"Clean, family owned and operated hotel.  Issues with room were quickly addressed to my satisfaction.  Victor, Maria and Carmita were helpful and pleasant. Easy walk to the lagoon, parking provided.  Enjoyed the stay.  Reduced rate for having stayed 3 straight nights."
"Después de que otro hotel no respeto nuestra reservación, el mirador fue una buena opción, cumple con todo lo necesario para una estancia comoda. La vista a la laguna no es realmente impresionante si te quedas en las habitaciones del primer piso pero la atención es excelente.  (Olvidamos una bocina y nos la guardaron hasta que pudimos recogerla muchos días después.) "
"Un hotel accesible en tránsito y en costo, te puedes desplazar a diversos puntos de bacalar y otras atracciones. El costo es accesible para viajar en familia, la atención muy buena, al pendiente de tus necesidades"
"Me encanta ir a éste sitio, la atención de todos es maravillosa! Las habitaciones son cómodas, me dejan hospedarme con mis mascotas (2perritos pequeñitos) La parte de la laguna no es la mejor, nunca me quedo a nadar ahí lo que es lamentable pero me encanta el personal tan amable."
"Está a unos minutos del pueblo pero con una excelente ubicación a la orilla de la Laguna, con excelente vista y no tienes más que dar unos pasos para nadar. Las habitaciones son pequeñas y sencillas pero el precio es bueno. Te recomiendo probar la pechuga a la plancha. Es un lugar atendido familiarmente por lo que hay confianza. Es el segundo hotel construido en Bacalar y si dices que los conociste por Chango Chilango.com te hacen descuento."

"Already the booking was annoying. After having paid the room, I received a message in Spanish that I had to pay the room again. Upon my request to send me the message in English and informing the hotel that I paid already, I received the same mail again... this time in English. A direct contact was unanswered and only an escalation via the booking site could solve the issue. Then the arrival at the hotel: dirty, disgusting linens, stinking toilet, dirty floor and walls. Also the air conditioning had no remo"
"Even before our arrival,we received several misleading mails about the payment status, all in Spanish, despite our requests to communicate in Englisch. We werde asked to pay again and resolved this issue only by contacting booking.com. When we arrived, the place was dirty, awfully smelly owing to a brocken sink and hot as the  AC remote control was missing and couldn't be retrieved. Charging €75 for that service is a complete rip off."
"Capsule full of spider, dirty sheets, dirty bathroom. Nothing staff hygiene. No safety measures regarding the pandemic, no masks or gels were used. EVERYTHING HORRIBLE, DIRTY AND ABANDONED. Unfriendly service staff.   They lie, they do not have private parking.   Far from the city, they have not cafeteria service and there isn´t bus line or cabs to get there."
"I went with my best friend's family and my boyfriend we occupied 4 rooms. The hotel needs maintenance but if you're not picky or sensitive about old beds, ok rooms, etc this hotel will do the trick. There are some rooms with lagoon view which is awesome! They have a restaurant and the food is good so no need to go out anywhere else for food. We were expecting to rent canoes but they didn't have available so that was a bummer. The hotel is pretty close to the Cenote Azul and Bacalar town which has more activ"

"At Tannah Maya they are just a bunch of liers trying to cheat customers. They have requested an advanced payment on a cancellable reservation, of course they do not refund the money. This reservation was made via booking, they even told booking that I wanted to cancel the reservation. Communication with the hotel is very bad, they answer whenever they want, they just ignore your question and ask for pre payment so they can keep the money and they are not friendly at all."
"Würde nur der Abschnitt vom Garten bis zum See bewertet, dann läge die Bewertung dieser Unterkunft ganz weit oben. Denn die Lage direkt am See, mit zugehörigem Steeg ist wunderschön. Doch leider wird aus diesem Bonus nichts gemacht.  Die Zimmer sind kahl und überhaupt nicht freundlich eingerichtet. Zudem lässt der Eigentümer die Zimmer verkommen. Die Schiebetüren des Schranks funktionierten ebensowenig, wie die Fliegengittertür zum Eingang des Zimmers. Ein Duschvorhang sucht man vergebens. DIe Gefahr eines "

"I stayed in this hostel for two nights and had a very good stay. I would rate the hostel 4 stars if the location would be a bit better. It is just too far from the center of Bacalar, so you need to walk quite for to the center.  The hostel itself is very nice and the employees are very helpful and welcoming. I stayed in the 4 bedroom which has two bunk beds, AC, lockers and a few, but enough plugs. The beds were good and the room is big enough. They also have some stuff to do a bit of a work-out.

Beautiful palapa perfect for our one nights stay. We were 3 people and our dog. The room was beautiful and the house stylishly decorated right down to the turquoise mandala dishes and cups!the garden with the hammocks was a great touch and nice for relaxing.   The only thing that was a little disappointing is that the photo says ‘bed and breakfast’ and the listing which we paid for stated ‘breakfast provided’ - however this is not the case. There is indeed a cafe attached to the house but usually when it sa
It is a nice place with good music in front of downtown bacalar twoblocks from the beach!   I like the seats and the environment.  It feels a very cozy place. We did not have food but just coffees and smothies.
"La casa está al pie de la Laguna, para llegar es un camino de terraceria un poco difícil de manejar, es recomendable llevar camioneta. La casa en realidad son dos habitaciones con baño completo y un baño adicional. La cocina es una mesa, te prestan platos y vasos pero se los llevan a lavar y a veces no los regresan, entonces los podrás usar solo una vez. Todo está retirado por lo que tienes que anticipar tus compras. Lleva mucho repelente...mucho. Te prestan kataks, y estar a ldo de l Laguna donde pasar un "

"Whilst travelling through Bacalar this January, my fiance and I, stumbled across this beautiful campsite on the shores of Laguna de los Siete Colores. It has such a secluded and intimate atmosphere with stunning flora, and the occasional hummingbird buzzing past. It has to be the most romantic place I have ever been to. Perfect for any honeymoon!  We chose to stay in the Cabañas literally centimetres from the waters edge which soothed us to sleep with the gentle lapping of waves on the bank. We chartered a "
" to stay longer than we had planned.  They are also an encyclopedia of local and regional knowledge and helped us with renting a car to explore a much wider area, which is awash with Mayan archaeological sites and stunning natural wonders. The campsite is around a 25 minute walk from the main town centre, which has everything you could need, as a base for further local exploring.  If you are looking for serene beauty and relaxation for your weary travelling feet then look no further. Hats off to Alejandra a"
"Estuve ahí en Bacalar de paso, y me gusto mucho este lugar porque puedes disfrutar de la vista y ahí mismo té puedes meter a la Laguna, tienes que llevar tu toalla porque ahí no tienen.  El aguachile es es bueno. Los tacos de cochinita son buenos. El resto de la comida a mi gusto le falta un poco de sabor "
"Advertised itself as being close to town, it was in fact 2 km, this would have been alright if it was a nice walk however it’s a choice between walking along a main road or down an unlit, dodgy-looking  dirt track. It also says there is breakfast which isn’t true at all, we were looked at as if we were mad when we asked for it. A washing machine is also advertised however you have to pay for this. The staff were v friendly however which was the main reason behind this being 3 stars not less."
"Estuvo muy tranquila la estancia, la familia que se encarga de cuidar y atender el hotel es muy amable y muy atenta, el lugar cuenta con un acceso privado a la laguna, es simplemente un terreno con una palapa y tienes que caminar un poco para poder accesar, de ahí en fuera todo se encuentra bien, la habitación donde nos hospedamos estaba limpia, contaba con agua fría y caliente en la ducha, no hay tv's, sí cuenta con wifi, aire acondicionado, el desayuno que incluye te lo preparan al momento y hay opción de"

We hebben ook zeker ‘s avonds genoten van ons terras, waar we lekker wat eten hebben laten bezorgen. Het personeel is allervriendelijkst, gastvrij en behulpzaam. De locatie is net iets buiten het centrum, maar daardoor erg rustig gelegen. Met de fiets kun je de drukte binnen no-time opzoeken.

Nous avons fait le choix qualité pris mais je pense que sur la même route il doit y avoir bien mieux.  Nous avons attendu très longtemps pour que le propriétaire veuille bien nous ouvrir le parking et la chambre. (Plus de 40 minutes)  Chambre très spartiate. Literie vraiment inconfortable. Pas de service donc bien penser à tout avant ( pas de ptit dej etc) Le WiFi ne fonctionne que sur la terrasse commune en bas des marches   Cependant très jolie vue
"El lugar es muy lindo. Está justo a lado de un cenote, así que tiene tanto zonas profundas como otras muy bajas.   Cuenta con hamacas, columpios y kayaks de uso libre.   La habitación es pequeña pero agradable. No obstante, hay dos cosas que no me permiten dejarle más de 3 puntos de calificación y es que la limpieza de la habitación era muy pobre.   La mesa parecía que jamás había visto un paño pues le limpiamos y habían restos de comida, dulce y tierra. La tazas de café que dejaron, estaban usadas, con res"

"Nous y avons passé 2 nuits début janvier après les fêtes. La propriété est située à l'extérieur du centre village de Bacalar (5 minutes en voiture) mais est en bordure du lac, on a donc un accès direct avec un plongeoir, 2 hamacs sur l'eau, 2 balançoires sur l'eau. La propriété donne même sur un des cenotes qui fait partie du lac, bref, c'est super pour accéder au lac et nager ! Il y a aussi des kayaks qui permettent de se déplacer facilement sur le lac.

Comme les chambres sont en haut de la propriété, on entend la nuit (quand il n'y a pas d'autre bruit) le bruit de l'autoroute mais ça n'est pas tellement gênant.

"We had the worst experience ever there's no hot water on the hotel  we didn't know that, of course they said that they told us because the hotel is ecological and has solar panels but hey , at home I also have solar panels and I shower everyday in really hot water!  They just forgot to mention that little detail. The girls in the reception area can't help you with anything and don't know anything.

"Everything about this place was amazing! The location was one of the best I’ve seen in Bacalar. Beds comfortable, everything clean. Great breakfast. Friendly staff. View from the room was incredible. Great outdoor area over lake to watch the sunrise/relax in hammock. "
"This Hostel is just perfect. Comfy beds, amazing view, great breakfast, relaxing smooth music, hammocks and peace. Free bikes and kayaks. Get up early to see the amazing sunset- it is worth it! The doors next to the Hostel is a Bar which offers Happy Hour from 5-7pm! Definitely enjoyed this place! "
"We enjoyed the informality of this very small hostel-hotel and interacting with the other guests. The morning breakfast at on large table gets the relationships started and this tends to continue all day, interrupted by this beautiful lake and the many ways to be in it and on it (kayak, paddle board, local tours, just swimming). The young owners are friendly and accommodating, but they need to invest in one or two more sit-ontop kayaks and bicycles so the very few guests don't have to wait to use these item"
"I Highly recommend the teaching in this place. This place has incredible Tamzcals, ceremonies and a wonderful community of people. They always look for volunteers, do message them! They're super great!"
"estuve en la casa de los niños del árbol en varias ocaciones, el lugar es muy amplio, encuentras gente muy agradable y se respira mucha tranquilidad y libertad, no es un hotel como tal, mas bien es como vivir en un rancho, el alojamiento es bueno, esta limpio, hay acceso a una cocina común y se ofrecen varios servicios extras como temazcal y ceremonias"
"the cleaning people steal the cash I had in my backpack. the owner said he was going to take charge now they say no, a real shame. the cabins do not have a safe or lockers to store your money or your passport. luckily they left me the documents to return to my country."
"It's a nice place and quiet but too expensive for what is offered (hut). The owner needs to improve the attitude, introvert. employees are really nice and the chef (Raul) cooks very good.  Guys need maintenance."
"We were recommended to go here while staying in Bacalar. Quiet and pleasant place, we enjoyed lounging on the jetty and swimming in the water. The water was clear, we could see the colours of the Laguna. Afterwards we had some food and drinks, we loved the camarones al coco, quite fair prices and the bar man was really kind and helpful. I would love to come back and it is definitely advised!!! "
"We stayed at one of the rustic cabins for two nights. The lodging option is ok, though a bit pricey for what you get. The cabañas needs some maintenance. The lagoon side areas and large gardens are very nice, quiet and feel very safe; you can go there to spend the day as well. You must have a way to move to and from this place, because it is a bit far from civilization, and there is virtually no Wi-Fi or cell signal in most of the area. Finding the place can be VERY HARD, this why I attached a photo of the "
"Un lugar simplemente maravilloso, en unos de los lugares más tranquilos y hermosos que hemos visitado para relajarnos y disfrutar en familia... solo tienen que visitarlo y disfrutar, la atención es extraordinaria y la experiencia única... un lugar al que regresarán para relajarse y olvidarse de todo... "
"The owner and her family are charming and so welcoming. They make you feel right at home. They have tents to rent or usable hammocks as well as room if you would like to set up your own.  They have a shower with great water pressure and hot water, a kitchen equipped with anything you could possibly want, on-site parking, kayaks for rent and a private pier with lake access. This is the type of place you get to and never want to leave."
"We loved it! We had planned to stay there for one night, but ended up staying for five nights, and had to drag ourselves away for Bacalar. The people working at the hostel were so nice and friendly! Felt like we were a small family. In the evenings they would have awesome drumcicles and jams out front in the bar. Theres a big garden and its the location is right next to the main plaxa and two blocks from the lagoon"
"We had all three complexes rented during our stay and we greatly enjoyed our time there.  The seclusion is what we needed and the jungle provided us with plenty of bird sounds in the morning. The collard aracari (toucan family) was a delight to see, as well as the chcalaca's, Great Kiskadee, social flycatcher, snail kite and the masked tityra.  We also saw a pumpkin wading along the shore, parrots flying overhead and brown jays.  The night sky was phenomenal at night when standing on the top roof. We only s"
" The caretaker next door was very helpful, as well as Bernard. The AC worked well in each of the rooms.  The beds were comfortable, but the bedsheets seemed old and should be replaced.  The only major complaint that we had was the sewer smell that was prevalent around the outside porch area.  A word of caution, there are no rails around the porches, so be careful and watch your children when they are on the porch."

"Our stay at MayaCala was full of magical moments with nature in its purest form. Both in water and on land, showing all of its beauty and it’s strength demanding from us respect and preservation. I hope we have another opportunity to go back. Thank you for sharing your home."
"We were highly disappointed. We found out that there was not enough sheets and blankets to accommodate us, so we had to go into town and purchase our own. There was not enough toilet paper for the five days that we stayed or clean water for drinking. We had to run into town to purchase our own clean water. No one available to make any kind of request regarding toilet paper and sheets at any time. Air conditioning was not working. The place was not clean as expected. ....

The house smelled like mold, it was not fresh and clean.... basically, the only aspect of the house that we enjoyed was the private beach with the kayaks and the paddling boards. Other than that the house was a huge disappointment..... It was all so far from town about 20 miles."
…
"Maya Cala has a lot of what I look for when I plan a vacation, it is located in a private area with so much to do on-site yet close to many great points of interest and activities. Every morning I enjoyed sipping on a cup of coffee outside, listening to the birds and soaking in the fantastic scenery from the balcony or lakeside under the palapa covered dock. I often found myself just staring out at the laguna with a smile on my face, thinking how amazing the view was, the colours, the sounds, I could never "

It is a two floor cabana, with sleeping on both floors which were well appointed,there was two baths, a kitchen, and dining room, and also a screened in porch on the front of the Casita,which used a lot. At the lake edge is is a large palapa with fantastic hammocks and table and chairs  for your use. For keeping active they offered kayaks"

"My wife and I resided at this marvelous well designed and well constructed two-level cabana on the shore of beautiful Laguna Bacalar for 6 weeks, beginning in mid-February. While we were there, my cousin joined us for a week, and some married friends joined us for the final 2 weeks of our stay. Having two full bathrooms with showers, and spacious sleeping quarters up and down, everyone was accommodated very comfortably, and plenty of fans were provided for the very hot days.

At the water's edge, there was a dock from which to swim or launch the two kayaks provided for exploring the coastline or easily reachable birding islands offshore. Also at the water's edge was a very nice, shady palapa, which became the perfect place to hang out on the hottest days, for it was cooled by the prevalent breezes coming off the Lag"

We asked to visit their high tower with an incredible view on the lagoon which was possible without paying anything. We do appreciate the kindness of the staff of this hotel and we recommend this visit if possible with having a drink.
"This place is so lovely...it sits right on a magical lagoon, there's a tower perfect for sunset viewing, and one cannot deny the sweet community vibe permeating this space. We didn't plan to go to Bacalar at all on out trip, but it ended up being my favorite stop on a month-long journey."
"We stayed three nights at the ranch in a cute cabana. We loved our stay! It was inexpensive, very relaxing and comfortable. The staff is great, very kind and welcoming. There's private access to the lake and the lake is truly paradise. The ranch was a great private spot but Bacalar town is close too. We loved the ranch and hope to return someday!"
We had a great time here - very friendly and fun owners. A really good way to spend new year. Amazing view of the lagoon - turquoise waters. Free access to kayaks all day too. Just a nice homely vibe at casa china
"Despite being listed on sites such as expedia, with prices and photos to suggest this is a hotel, it is not. Level of service, amenities, cleanliness, comfort, etc. is very much that of a hostel and not a hotel. Therefore it is quite overpriced. "
"First and foremost, ""thank you"". Each and every person at this one of a kind retreat we can not say enough about. During a month long stay beginning in Cozumel, to the interior of the Zona Maya in Chunhuhub, throughout Quintana Roo from Cancun to Chetumal, and to the beautiful state of Chiapas we found ourselves returning to Num Kaan Ranch. Three stays in all, first two in the perfect little ""Cabana Bella"" just right for two for the amazing price of $450 pesos (appx. $30.00 US). Our last stay in ""Casita Cow"

We were welcomed by Ricardo and his highly capable staff.  We selected the Pagoda room and were more than pleased - even better, they accepted our sweet puppy as well!!  In the morning we kayaked, Ricardo provided excellent recommendations, both for boat tours (their sailing trip was already full for the day, sadly!), as well as pizza!  The mo"

There is free access to the kayaks which are included in the rate of the room which is great too. The beds were huge and comfy. On the other hand, the breakfast was a bit disappointing: no roasted coffee (only instant one), a few slices of crispbread with margarine and jam, a few fruits. Secondly, the cleanliness level of the rooms (we had one with garden view for one night and one with lake view on"
" not so clean and not so fully equipped. Even so, the overall experience in Casa China was good, thanks to the friendly crew and the place. Bacalar is an absolute must see. Good place if you are after friendly, laid back places and not so much after high quality hotel service."

"Als wir in Bacalar ankamen, hatten wir vorher einige Hotels im Internet rausgesucht und angefangen durchzutelefonieren (machten wir in der Regel lieber, um dem Hotel die Kommissions-Kosten zu ersparen und oft bekommt man auch ein günstigeres Angebot).

"Chambre simple mais agréable avec balcon donnant sur le jardin et la lagune , très belle vue. Gros bémol : la pollution sonore ! À côté de l’hôtel il y’a un autre hôtel qui balance du reagaeton toute la soirée . Et l’hôtel lui même balance du son bien fort également .  D’une jolie surprise c’est devenu une expérience très moyenne. Dommage car ce petit hôtel de 6 chambres est fort sympathique. Personnel très sympa et attentif."
"Quel spot magnifique! Une vue au petit matin incroyable avec un levé de soleil dont ne se lassera jamais! La chambre est cosy avec une belle décoration et une clim très efficace. Nous avions pris la chambre avec vue sur le lagon, terrasse avec hamac, un régal.  L’équipe est top et donne de très bons conseils pour les visites, le barman fait de chouette cocktail et il y a paddle et kayak dispo. Nous avons pu garer notre voiture aussi à l’intérieur! bref, si l’on revient on hésitera pas à y retourner."
"El lugar es bonito, pero tiene los siguientes detalles, que de solucionarse sería una mejor estadía: 1.-el wi-fi no funcionó en toda la semana que estuvimos. 2.- No proporcionan más que 1 sola toalla de playa y no puedes sacar la del cuarto, porque te la cobran como si fuera de buena marca y nueva. ( Hay que llevar mejor sus propias toallas). 3.- La atención al cliente de la encargada NO es la más adecuada, todo el tiempo te está vigilando cómo si le fueran a robar algo.

DO NOT STAY HERE!  Last weekend somebody broke into our large dormitory room while 3 of us slept. 3 phones were taken from under our pillows and money from each of us. There was a party going on until 6am (literally next door) which obviously concealed the sounds of the intruder. Bags were searched through right next to our beds and certain items taken/left which showed   that the thief was very experienced. The bedroom was attached to another empty room (not locked) therefore it is likely an intruder hid i

The door wasn't locked and therefore open for all guests, despite being at the back of the building and requiring guests to enter through the front door first.

Clearly whoever was on night duty was not guarding the door efficiently, or as I suspect it was connected to an inside j"

"I recently stayed at this place in March of 2021.  The advertisement shows beautiful rooms with a view right next to the lagoon.  Indead that much is true, however, their rooms, or at least the room I was given was anything but!  I paid - in advance mind you, for a room with a VIEW and a BALCONY.  I got neither.

"The only thing royal about this place is the Royal Palms (or Roystonea Regia trees). It isn't even a hotel. There are four small buildings with a total of eight cabins on an uncleared piece of jungle that in part looks rather shabby, with construction rubble and junk in several places. Five cabins are situated not far from the main road and are therefore exposed to traffic noise. To get from these cabins to the lake one needs to follow a meandering unpaved road that gets muddy after a rain shower. The ""Beac"

" more than it really is. The cabins are spacious and clean but basic. Water pressure was low. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We paid 1,650 MXN per night  for a cabin near the main road. There are no breakfast facilities, but if so wished breakfast can be ordered from a place nearby. The lagoon is spectacular. We weren't charged for the use of the kayaks and paddle boards. Our three night stay was pleasant, but one shouldn't put one's expectations very high as to the degree of luxury."

"Обман. Большая часть заявленных на сайтах бронирования данных не соответствует действительности. Например, на Booking.com отель позиционирует себя как пятизвёздочный. На самом деле это не более чем хостел. Два стареньких обветшалых здания в 50 метрах от шумной скоростной трассы 307 Четумаль - Канкун. Ресепшн работает только днём. Хостел заявляет, что находится в 200-250 метрах от озера. По карте легко проверить, что по прямой это более 400 метров, а по дороге более 550. При этом дорога плохая, сильно замусо"
The Hotel is really clean and rooms are big and spacious. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful. It Was walking distance to many locations. The Hotel also offers bike rental for $15 pesos per hour. Also in there lobby they have free coffee in the mornings. There is 2 public bañaderos very close to the hotel one to the left of hotel like a block down and the other is to the right of the hotel like two blocks. 
It was a nice room and the price was okay and the staff really friendly and helpful too but we couldnt sleep well refering to the loudness..you can hear everything which is going on outside of your room..i wouldnt go back
"Found this hotel in the dark. Paid 500 pesos for a basic room. It is quiet, clean and fairly centrally located. The bed springs can be somewhat uncomfortable as the mattresses are well worn. A/C is cold and showers hot.   Highlight is the free wifi with which I'm booking other accommodations..."
"As part of our travelling along the Reviera Maya, we decided to spend a night in Bacalar to relax and enjoy some of the spectacular views of the Lagoon.  We go in at around 4pm, took a cab and started looking around for a hotel near the lagoon.  We checked out Hotel Laguna Bacalar and Hotelito El Paraiso; Based on the unit I was show, Hotel Laguna Bacalar is not worth the money!  Hotelito El Paraiso is pretty nice but they were located quite a ways from the center of town so we decided not to stay.  We drov"
"This is a 2.5 -3 star hotel. It is clean, but there is no restaurant. It is on a partially paved road. I had a rental car, and the designated parking was in a vacant lot behind an abandoned building. My room was filled with mosquitoes. The room was comfortable enough after I managed to kill all of the mosquitoes. I felt it was overpriced for what it offered. I am not sure why it is called Tierra Maya Spa and Sanctuary. Maybe spas services are offered on site, but I did not see a designated area for such ser"
Our room was beautiful and clean with very comfortable bed and great shower.  Six rooms border a pretty patio garden with pool.  Quiet.  Food is just a couple of level blocks away.  Very nice staff gave us as many coffee pods as we desired.
"This hotel is very cosy and has a nice atmosphere. We loved our stay here, slept like a baby. The beds are amazing. No breakfast, but plenty of options in de neighbourhood like Enamora just 5 minutes away. "
"This Tierra Maya Hotel Spa and Sanctuary is NOT in Xcalak, there is a Tierra Maya...but it is NOT a spa/sanctuary...I think the one you are advertising is in Belize.  It is correct on the map, but not the photos and address"
"Our stay was unforgettable but not because it was a good stay, but because it was so not taken care of that it gave you the impression that its old and not clean at all!  We even had cockroaches in the bathroom! I would honestly never stay here again I didn't even want to get in bed. I have stayed in other places in Bacalar for even cheaper prices and way much better."
"I had a confirmed reservation for a so-called ""deluxe suite"", but all I got was a third-class accomodation, neither the tv nor the internet was working, a dirty bathroom, no water pressure in the basin, noisy streetfront. They say that when they got my reservation, the deluxe suites were all occupied, but why did they confirm then? Beware of this place, better spend your money elsewhere!"
There is some confusion about this place as there is hostel in the nearby town with the same name. About 4k from Bacalar (not a great walk so car or taxi needed) it is accessed by an unmade road off the main road. A bit bumpy but our little Nissan managed it. It is a modest plot but big enough.Right on the Lagoon. No long jetty but a wooden terrace over the edge of the water. Several loungers and a couple of paddle boards available. There are 3 Cabanas  and we stayed in Botoncillo. Big spacious room (not a 
"First off this is not a nice hotel.  Several of the rooms, including the one we were placed in open directly onto the sidewalk. On a very busy street. Right next to a restaurant that stays open till near midnight. So with the old original windows it’s a pretty noisy room.   The room next to it that we declined had a strong odor of poop.  The noise and location make it a poor choice for staying in Bakalar. The tiny tv and the cold lights make it a terrible choice. Especially for the cost.   The dishonesty co"
" per person. And it was through a company further down the lake. Well we took the tour, which was fine, except for that it only lasted just under two hours. After we got off the boat I asked the tour manager why it didn’t last three hours to which he replied that none of his tours last three hours. I then  inquired as to how much the tour would cost directly from them - 250 pesos.  So Monica with Toto Blue sold me a three hour tour for a 60% mark up and we got a two hour tour. That’s highly dishonest and un"
" table/chairs. Food is available from campsite next door is adequate if needed and they sell sweets beer and crisps.  Friendly staff made our time here very pleasant. Cons - lot of bugs (take spray). The only other negative is restricted access around the Lagoon, we had hoped to walk around some of it but private property boundaries go to the water. Recommended for a 2or3 night stay."

"I’m writing this review as I’m checking out of the hotel. We booked this accomodation thinking it was luxury tier as advertised on their website, our mistake was not reading the reviews on trip advisor prior to booking the room.  Upon arrival we noticed our room (a family room) was located on street side and right next to a taco shop, making it the noisiest place I’ve stayed at in my entire life. The shower/ restroom area looked old and dirty, only two towels were provided for a room of four people (both of"
"Este pequeño hotel está al pie de la laguna, ideal para quienes aman el contacto con la naturaleza. Sus instalaciones son básicas, limpias y de buen gusto. Le faltan cortinas blackout, si esperas dormir hasta tarde.  Mejorará cuando, en vez de un velador de construcción, tengan de guardia a alguien con sensibilidad hotelera y cuando no tengan un perro bravo encadenado, que dejan suelto en la noche, sacó un fuerte susto a mi esposa.  La anfitriona es amable y controla, o trata de controlar (mejor dicho), vía"
" it’s town hall’s” which in my opinion was rude considering my dad IS the customer of the hotel (side note: water in the shower was cold and started running 1 hour late).   When it comes to ammenities bottled water was not provided, there’s NO parking & the wifi connection couldn’t be reached in my room.   Overall I wouldn’t give this place more than 2 stars, it should be ranked at hostel category or as a two star hotel because this is definitely not “boutique hotel level”. You definitely DO NOT get value f"
…
"Service and place was nice.   However, room ran out of water, then ran out of hot water. There was a gas leak in the building.  Breakfast is very slow and limited.  Finally, there is no fridge or microwave on the rooms."
"Beautiful hotel with a great restaurant/bar and swimming pool to lounge. 5 min walk to the lagoon, 10 min walk to the city. The staff were amazing, and very knowledgeable about the area, booked a pontoon tour on the lagoon for us that was cheaper than many other options, could not have asked for a better experience!"
"nice setting,  breakfast incl chilaquiles,  eggs, crêpes ( Second day no crêpes available). We were ( as foreigners) at arrival presented a Laguna tour that had to be paid at reception desk but in cash, not card. Few English speaking skills ( but we believe you should visit Mexico and try to talk Spanish). Room at streetside of our kids dit not have a well closing window or door ( could put finger through it) and hence too noisy. Nearby taquerias provider honest food."
"Great staff, clean and spacious rooms, and parking available. Generally quite happy.  Would definitely recommend when staying in Bacalar.  Minor points: the pool, although lovely for the eye, is not for actual swimming (quite small). Breakfast was good, but could have more options. "
"Perfect hotel for our stay in Bacalar. Great customer service, amazing rooftop with a pool and lagoon view, super yummy breakfast, free parking and good internet.  Totally recommend it.  Will definitely be back."
We enjoyed a lot the Tuparenda hotel in Bacalar for its friendly staff and easy communication. Hotel location a 10min walk to main square and there are some good restaurants/bars within 5min walk. Staff can recommend you good ones (as well as tours). Nice pool and terrace on the rooftop (enlighted with nice colors when it gets dark) and you can view the lagoon from the top. Room was clean and has everything you need! Free parking and good internet. Totally recommend it!
My parents and I just had a wonderful stay at Hotel Tuparenda in Bacalar. We were greeted by the owner Francisco who could not have been more helpful giving us food recommendations and organizing a wonderful boat tour for us the next morning. He was very attentive to our needs and continued to check in with us during our stay to ensure we were having a wonderful time. The property is very new and the room was immaculate. The shower had great pressure and was the warmest shower we’ve had in Mexico. The hotel
 this hotel to anyone visiting Bacalar and my family and i will definitely be back! Thank you Francisco and your wonderful family for an unforgettable visit! 
…
"The hotel is at the limit north offre the town. So neighbourhood are not so nice but safe (some wild dogs around) . But you have very closed a public beach. Rooms are dark (only windows is on passage alley) but clean. Good air conditioning system, good and spacious bathroom. Breakfast is ok: they have fresh fruits, flakes yogurth and they can prepare eggs any style and pancakes. Trust owner suggestions for beaches. We were very satisfied. "
"This amazing family own hotel would fill all your expectations, super clean , great details and decoration ,spacious rooms . Excellent location, delicious breakfast in the amazing roof top with great view to the lake,, but the most important, outstanding service by owner Francisco and his family, they’re there for you 24/7,,,this place worth every single penny,,, 100% recommended!!!!!!!!"
"few steps from the lagoon with public access. courtesy  and kindness of the owner.the place ""vale la pena"" because is ""pura vida"". Not yet ""Cancunized""  and still remains the same quiet and relaxing site"
"My title says it all really. My Spanish is poor, the staff team spent time ensuring we understood one another - particularly useful at breakfast. The room was a good size, the bed comfortable. Could not ask for more for the price. Spot on. "
Check in was fast and easy and recommendations on things to do and places to eat were perfect.   The room was neat and clean.  Perhaps the only thing missing was a chair in the room but the common lounge area was comfortable and served the purpose.  The free breakfast was a great way to start the day. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  Do take the boat tour they recommend!
"I had the most wonderful time there. It’s like living in a private house just in front of the lagoon, with a direct access into the water (and free kayaks). The room was clean and had amazing view. The stuff was so nice. It felt like home. Definitely recommend."
"My wife and I visited Bacalar in October 2021 and we had an excellent stay at Amigos Hotelito. The staff is incredibly kind and helpful. They helped us book a boat tour, get taxis and provided great recommendations for places to eat and visit in Bacalar. Our room was fantastic and included a balcony and hammock. The hotel also has a dock and hammock, which I loved. This is a great spot if you want a more intimate experience versus a huge, soulless hotel."
"We arrived to a clean and organized place with friendly staff. Room was nice and comfortable, but I would recommend putting cotton sheets, arranging the water supply in bathroom and shower, some leaks and water pressure not very good. It would be amazing having dish ware available 24/7."
"We stayed only two nights in this delightful small hotel with a great view of the beautiful lake - two nights isn't nearly enough.  It was a pleasant, clean and reasonably spacious room. The owner Sebastian was friendly and enormously helpful advising on restaurants, arranged sailing tour  and he drove one of us to see a doctor and Sebastian translated for us as the doctor couldn't speak English.  One of his staff whose name I can't remember was also very friendly and helpful."
"My husband, my daughter and myself stayed at Amigos Hotelito for 2 nights. I would recommend the hotel for its location (waterfront), price (good value) and friendly staff, although the rooms are basic and there is no restaurant. You have to drive or walk to town for food. The best part was relaxing on the deck with amazing views of the lagoon. The hotel arranged for us a sailboat tour (no polluting motorboats) that was a lot of fun. We saw the sun set as the full moon was rising. The hotel also rents kayak"
"I will recommend this place for its price and its location. It is very relaxing and peaceful, only 6 guest rooms. It is located walking distance (15 minutes) from the center. But the best it is the view of the lake from the hotel. Paradise! If you are looking for to disconnect from the world, this is the place. They offer free WIFI, and a fridge and microwave is a available to use in the common area. There is NO restaurant. "
"We stayed here for a few nights over Christmas. The rooms are great, clean and with wonderful views. However, on the upstairs rooms, you have to slam the door to shut it. It can get very loud and disturbing.   This is not a bed and breakfast. They don't even have coffee in the morning. We bought our own ground coffee in town and used their coffee pot. Unfortunately, other guests thought it was the hotels coffee and helped themselves to it.   Im not sure if it was because of the holidays, but it appeared tha"
"The hotelito is excellent, hosts are very nice.rooms are super, with own balcony and nice beachview! The common kitchen was great for using. Kayaks are available and we made more tours with sunrise on the lake. For friends, travellers or couples also a great choice! "
"We traveled to Bacalar with friends from Cancun.  Its always great when traveling with people who know the area when you are traveling in a foreign country.  Our friends wanted us to see on of their favorite places so they took us to Lake Bacalar.   We stayed at Amigos for 2 nights.  The place was really neat.  It wasn't fancy and I don't think it can be called a Bed & Breakfast.  It was neat and clean with a porch with a hammock.  I think it only had 6 rooms and the caretaker, Sebastian stayed in one of th"
" lot of time on the lake.  It was beautiful with colors that you would associate to the Caribbean.  Loved swimming in the fresh water.    We paid about $57 a night.  We had a king size bed and a twin that had a pull out.  We had satellite TV and Internet.    We had a room on the first floor.  One step down off the porch and you were on the big patio just off the lobby.    You do have to go down lots of step to get to the hotel from the road,.,  Definitely not handicapped accessible. They do have a gate wher"
Such a peacful place on the perfect lake of Bacalar with its blue waters and white sands.  Kayaks and paddle boards are complementary  which is a plus. The very well kept  garden with lots of possibilities makes you feel at home . The staff is friendly and helpful. The bungalows are furnished nicely with special care and the AC works perfect.  My Tacos were prepared fresh and tasted very good. We will come again to this little heaven.
"The hotel itself and the room is quite nice. However, we had a minor and a major issue.  Minor: The food is not good. This is really a pity since it would be amazing to hang out at the lake all day. Like this, you have to get into town for lunch and dinner which is quite a hassle. Also, they only offer 2 pieces of toast per person in the morning which is an incredibly stupid artificial limit and left me hungry.  Major: I gave them my laundry to wash. Apparently, they gave it to an external laundry. It had a"
" for a load of laundry that immediately needs another wash somewhere else. We escalalated it at the hotel, but they kept referring us to the external laundry service. (""You can get a taxi and go talk to them"") This is unacceptable for a service we bought at the hotel.  Overall, due to the fact that the staff and the management doesn't care about the experience of the guests, I recommend not to stay here."
…
"The place is very clean and quiet, cabins are decorated differently and they are very nice. We stayed at the Cisne and we really love the landscape of the place in general. At night time the place looks gorgeous.  Do not expect to have a great meal there. That is the one thing they have to work on however, since the hotel is located in town you will have plenty of choices to go eat for either meal.   We will definitely go back."
"Since we arrived we were in love with the view , blue bird has the best facilities, private bungalows, bar, kayaks, paddle board...is very well located, you just swim few meters and get to a small island infront that is a magical paradise. Service is excelent! We definitely recommend to stay at blue bird, all the facilities included on the rate is great so you don't pay extras like other places! Private , cozy and extremely comfortable!  We will be back soon!!!"
"the Service is bad....  The linen and towels are dirty and Stains.  Bad and small breakfast, They lied about what we should get.  The hotel and facilities are beautiful, But there is no service consciousness  "
"Perfect rooms, beautiful lagoon, Kiaking and watersports ? They have it. 7 shades of blue and hammocks plus swings inside the water . Would definitely come back again a million times. Aswell,  don’t get me started on Djamillas food ! "
"A beautiful hotel and a real oasis after a long drive. Rooms are beautifully designed (incl AC and a fan) and hot showers. There are two lovely pools, yoga classes Fri - Sun (included), breakfast, an honesty bar area, a great library with books to read and board games to play. Everything you need for a very chilled out experience. Staff are friendly and helpful too. Would recommend!"
"My husband and I stayed at Casa Hormiga over the Easter weekend and couldn’t be happier with our choice. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, peaceful, and has amazing staff.  Breakfast is included with your stay and it’s super yummy. The staff is super attentive and always ready to help. We will definitely be coming back to stay here on our next trip to Bacalar.   P.S. They are affiliated with La Playita which is a restaurant right on the Lagoon. This alone is a great perk when trying to get a table to eat a"
We loved this hotel so much! From the minute you arrive it is so tranquil - hard to do it justice but the architecture and design is breathtaking. It’s so quiet and peaceful. Great location to the town of Bacalar and lots of nice restaurants nearby. La Playita is their beach club so you get to skip the queue and get a table there which they will organise for you. The breakfast was lovely - a buffet selection and you can also order off the menu. We ate lunch snacks and dinner here once or twice too and all t
 borrowing their bikes and cycling around the streets of Bacalar! We loved it so much we came back for another night - thanks so much Casa Hormiga for an amazing stay.
…
The aesthetics was everything that we hoped for.  It was so beautiful.  The decor was amazing.  They had an “honest bar” where we could get drinks if the bartender wasn’t present and write it down on our tab.  They had yoga in the mornings and a nice pool.  They had bikes that we could borrow which we took around town and was great fun.  The staff was very helpful and kind.  The only negative comment I have it that we are light sleepers.  We brought a white noise machine and ear plugs but wasn’t enough for 
"Beautiful review, lovely fresh breakfasts (yes there are eggs, and yogurt and homemade granola… and ingredients for Mexican breakfast and fresh fruit, juices, homemade bread, and jams.  Pools and grounds gorgeous, library of art books amazing.  Kind helpful staff.  Massages great, and their beach club la playita, so yummy and great spot too.  Rooms wonderful and my tweens and teen loved it too-games to play in library.  Cool pool.  Loft bed!"
"The staff, property, everything is excellent! I’ve spent the nicest 5 days in Bacalar♥️  Quiet and peaceful place. You can ask to order the dinner to your room from the restaurant, breakfast is included. The pool is not big but very well designed, feels like your private space. There are a special place for yoga or meditation and a library. Highly recommend!"
Absolutely loved our stay at Casa Hormiga. One of the highlights of a two week trip to the Yucatan. We added a second night. By staying in town itself your forego staying on the beautiful lagoon but the hotel arranged a private sailing for us (180$) which was amazing and we loved being able to walk around town to eat and drink. They have access to a beach club which we didn't use as well as bikes to get around. The design of the hotel is stunning and the staff was wonderful. It's a specific kind of luxury (
"Very friendly and helpful staff, perfectly designed and decorated. An oasis of calm and comfort. Has no direct access to lagune, but great location close to restaurants and public access to lagune close by. We enjoyed our stay so much that we extended our time at Casa Hormiga. It was simply perfect!"
La Albarina was a very cute space. It was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. They do not have very many people working and they close the food/bar at 4pm. They are otherwise extremely helpful and there whenever you need help to call a taxi/carry luggage/etc. La Albarina definitely has one of the best locations on the whole lake and a very nice space to relax and swim. Boats can pick you up at the dock and it is a very cheap and speedy taxi ride to town. Overall such a breathtaking place- I absolu
"Cet chambre d’hôte a le potentiel pour avoir une meilleure note car l’hôte est très gentil, très serviable , le cadre est magnifique et le petit déjeuner est très bon.  Très bien situé , chambre très propre et spacieuse , bien équipé.  Le gros problème c’est que vous ne pouvez pas dormir , il y a plusieurs coq qui commencent à brailler des 4h du matin toute les 20 minutes jusqu’à 7h et les chambres sont insonoriser du coup vous entendez toute la conversation de la chambre à côté.  C’est vraiment dommage car"
"Wunderschöne und sehr gepflegte Anlage, direkt am See, zwischen zwei Zenoten. Es ist angenehm ruhig und lädt zum Verweilen ein. Die Besitzerin und der Manager, sowie alle Angestellten sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Zimmer haben alles, was man sich wünscht. Das Frühstück ist sehr gut. WiFi funktioniert bestens. Wer relaxen möchte, ist hier richtig.  Es gibt keine Restaurants zum Abendessen in dieser Gegend. In ca. 45 Minuten ist man zu Fuss im Zentrum. Mit dem Auto dauert es wenige Minuten. Oder "
"Nicht wundern! ..sobald die Tore vom Personal aufgemacht werden, eröffnet sich der direkte Blick auf die Lagune und lässt das Reiseherz höher schlagen!   Ein Ort zum entspannen! Auf unserer Durchreise haben wir eine Nacht reserviert, wir hätten uns aber auch einen längeren Aufenthalt vorstellen können.   Die kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellten SUPs laden direkt ein die Lagune zu erkunden oder an die nahe gelegenden Cenoten zu paddeln.   Der Aufenthalt war sorgenfrei und auch unser Mietauto stand sicher im In"
"A true retreat on the lake just a bit out of town next to the Cenote Azul and virtually on the cenote in the lake. Great snorkeling right from the dock with lots of places to just chill and take in the view. The room was perfectly done, as were the grounds. The couple who own and run this place are a delight. They explained the Stromatolites, their importance and how to respect them. They also arranged a private boat tour of the lake. We only wished we could have stayed another day or two!"
"Never experienced such a bad attitude from the managers. Paco, one of the managers has no hospitality training, no touch, no idea of what customer service is behaves like a dysfuctional robot. Seems to be that he does not even want to be there. The place is not what it seems to be on the photos. The views on the rooms are not as shown. Despite of an intent to revamp and old property it just feels old. Not to mention that they do not care at all about protecting the Stromatolites that they are right on the p"

A very personalized stay and good vibes from Roberto who listened and responded to any/all needs and requests going above and beyond every single time.

Safe for all to travel, gated area, parking, wifi, and extra cl"
"We had a wonderful stay at La Albarina. The hotel grounds are beautiful and very relaxing. The hotel's owner, Roberto was very friendly and helped us with whatever we needed. The location on the lagoon is amazing, and it's a short drive into town where there are restaurants and shops. I would recommend having some cash on hand because almost all of the ATMs in town were broken."
Roberto and staff we unreal as we happen to have the whole facility to ourselves...The continental breakfast each morning was perfect and coupled with the view it was over the top...We’ll be back...  Ron C
+ Location  - Dirty rooms  - poor WiFi  - no real toilet (just holes in the ground)  - very bad road to get there  - restaurant does not deserve the name - rather an fast food shack   All in all at the level of an average hostel - for more than 100 Euro per night not acceptable.  
"We just returned from a FANTASTIC holiday at this unique and magic place.  The road is bumpy yes because you are not arriving to the St. Regis!!! Instead you hace the opportunity to enjoy and authentic Eco Hotel with fantastic service, authentic home made taste cuisine and above all outstanding hospitality.

"I really like the place a lot, If you are looking for a retreat with privacy, silence, a place to read, to actually disconnect from all the stress outside, this is your place, quiet little cabin, a friend and I went there to have a space for ourselves.

"This hotel is priced as a luxury hotel (US$ 100+ per night), but it fails to deliver in all aspects. I stayed there for 2 of the 4 nights I had booked and moved to Rancho Encantado, which is infinitely better and at the same price. Mattress is lumpy and uncomfortable, pillows are horribly tortuous!  The room is dark and dingy and furniture is cheap and amateur- ecologic does not have to be dingy and old!! Outdoor bathroom sounds sexy and nice, but it's not when you're trying to use the toilet and have rain "
" and AC outlets. Nothing ecologic about that, also extremely unpleasant to always have that background noise!!  Staff is very friendly but did not reimburse us for the two nights we did not stay."
…
"I booked for two nights on the same day with no problem! This place is the absolute cutest. The look of the hotel is very nice and zen, I was extremely pleased. You're about a 5-minute walk from the lagoon which makes this spot even better. I really enjoyed their outside space that is provided in the back to just hang out.  Each front desk receptionist was super helpful and provided us as many water bottles as we needed! Our room was very clean and the hot water worked perfectly (I did have to ask for assis"
"We stayed in this boutique hotel for 3 nights, and it was great! Rooms are very clean, staff is supper friendly and accommodating. The rooms have everything that you need. If you thinking of visiting Bacalar, stay at this hotel.  "
"We arrived very late with no reservation and must have snagged the last room. The man at the front was extremely helpful and got us checked in right away so we could get showered and to sleep. The bed was extra comfy, no hot water, but they said they were fixing it when we were there.The place was so zen and beautiful. The breakfast is delicious and every single person who worked there was friendly. Really enjoyed my stay here. Felt like paradise. "
"This place is paradise, we had an amazing time and my family loved it. There is nothing to improve bc everything was so on point. Top of the line!!!! Highly recommend!!! Rooms, food, drinks, outdoors, all 5 stars."
"Me and my husband decided to have 3 relaxing days to this beautiful destination which is Bacalar and we stayed at Villa Balu Hotel Boutique, BEST choice ever. From the service and the Hotel itself  everything was Amazing. We wanted to do some water tour around the Lagoon and they provide us the tour!! is not Amazing??? what ever your needs are, they make it possible. The Staff is very friendly and that the continental breakfast is included is plus !!!! Thank you so much for such a great experience. We are g"
"I went to Bacalar for q couple days and stay at this beautiful and just bran new hotel. Everything was perfect!!  The location is great ! Close to everything l, you can walk anywhere you want to go. The service is amazin everyone is trying so hard to do the best to help you and serve.  The rooms are very nice and clean. Just brand new  I love it l. Highly recommended"
"The positives: lovely large pool and design.  Tasty breakfasts (but see below).  Great public spaces (which you will use).   Relatively spacious bathroom.   Price acceptable.  However realise that you will have not one extra inch to move in the room, and will have to climb steep stairs to the bed, which will require one of a couple to clamber over the other to get in or out of the small loft space.  If you are fine with that, or a solo traveller, then this could be a good option.  Also, filter coffee refill"
 wonderful….

"Great hotel, especially the chill-areas. Haven't seen a hotel like this before. Rooms are a bit small though and so was the bed, but I have to say that I'm used to a huge bed, so maybe I'm spoiled. We had some issues with our rooms, which were mechanical. Things happen..it's about how you handle these things. they did their utmost best to make us satisfied, which we definitely were.  Great: - the service was excellent. Jessica and the other girl (sry for forgetting the name) we're precisely the hosts that s"
" the rooms and bed were somewhat small. But it's not a very big deal. - breakfast is probably nice, but a lot of beans and no bread. It's just not our thing. Although if you ask for plain eggs, you'll get them.  Not great: - nothing  Conclusion: very satisfied. Go there if you go to bacalar. This hotel made our stay in bacalar much better than it otherwise would be probably."

"Stayed for 2 nights and would have loved to stay longer. Friendly staff, ecological pool and mindset. Great breakfast was included. Choice of two from the menu: One sweet and one savory. The rooms could seem small to some people and the stairs yo the bed a bit steep but it has all you need and the hanging out can easily be done at other spots of the hotel. Hammock in front of the room, swing over the pool, relaxing area next to the small pool at the top. The location also near to the center as well as to th"

Our stay at the Eco Hotel Boutique Makaabá in Bacalar was extraordinary :) We were not only happy with the room and the people but with the whole concept of the hotel. We are really thankful for their work and commitment to our planet. The food was also really special and delicious. Without doubt we would come back here in our next stay in Bacalar!!  We are already missing the dog Nina!  Saludos  Annie & Thalía
"We really had a GREAT TIME!!   First time to Bacalar - probably won't go back. Been there done that - but it was a nice trip and the hotel was was clean, great breakfast, nice pool, no complaints - centrally located - they have a fridge in the main lobby if you want to store food or beverages.  Blackouts happen pretty regularly in the town and I mean whole town goes black - but not for long.  Our friends went the week after we did - blackout!!"
"We really enjoyed our stay here.  Perhaps it wasn't as luxurious as some we stayed in but the rooms were clean, spacious and had air conditioning.  Sitting by the pool with a cold beverage was a daily activity.  It is close enough to city centre to make a nice walk.  You can catch a local softball game just a couple blocks away.  The lake front is also well within walking distance and we went every day as well.  There are good restaurants all within 15 minutes walk and you can rent bikes if you want.  They "
"Hotel nuevo y bonito. La habitaciones son muy limpias y lindas bien equipadas. Con una hermosa vista al lago, camastros y mesas con vista al muelle y lago. Disfrutamos mucho este pequeño lugar, desde la llegada Morelia recepcionista fue muy agradable, los cócteles del bar estaban increíbles, muy ricos y bien presentados. El desayuno estuvo delicioso. Es 100 recomendable. Solo nos hubiera gustado que ahí mismo rentaran , paddles ,bicis y Kayaks. Pero justo a lado conseguimos ese equipo. De igual modo el rest"
"We had en-suite room with 2 beds: one king one double. Clean place, good AC in the room, good en-suite, close to the cenotes, attentive staff. Wifi works. There is clean water and tea and coffee and biscuits in the hall also. Thanks for a great stay!"
"The place is quiet, nice and clean, the pool area is very nice, the staff is friendly and gentle. The breakfast has the traditional Mexican homemade style. I love the tortillas and the Mexican sausage  I want to go back there soon !!!"
We stayed for two nights the place was super clean and had everything we needed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool and awesome breakfast were great bonuses. I would recommend and hope to visit again soon myself.
"Excelente opción para un buen desayuno, pan de masa madre hecho en casa y la.vista es muy bonita , el pan de plátano y sus conchas son muy ricas, Recomiendo ampliar su menú para almuerzos puesto que solo hay alimentos de 8 am a 2 ok y es el mismo menú, precio promedio de 150 pesos por platillo  "
"Très belle chambre, accès à la lagune via un ponton, seul point noir : 8 transats seulement. Serviettes de bain à disposition.  Chambre très propre et spacieuse. Bon restaurant. Petit déjeuner avec choix. Calme.  Il est préférable d avoir une voiture pour y accéder. Quelques restaurants à proximité . Personnel très serviable, au bar on maîtrise bien l anglais."
"This is the most lousy hotel in Mexico! Terrible Service! The rooms are ugly and the staff very unfriendly. They lied at us, when we were asking, if there was WFI - there was no internet and they didn´t care about our complain. If there wouldn´t be the good sight, nobody would stay there. There are a lot of hotels in Bacalar, which are  much better for the same price! Horrible place! Never ever again!"
"The Hotel is well situated, very close to the Lagoon, and a few hundred meters from the zocalo, the central square. The price is very competitive and if you don't mind a short walk, or if you have a car, is a very good choice.  The hotel provides for free some coffee and cookies in the morning. Our room was quite small but well equipped with a/c, fan, tv and fridge."
"Hotel Bacienda is a clean and tidy hotel within walking distance to Central Bacalar. The staff were lovely and the free breakfast was more than satisfactory. The bed was also one of the comfiest I stayed in during my time in Mexico, including a 4 star resort in Tulum!"
"My boyfriend and I spent two nights at Marina Magic Bacalar and loved it! Our double room was small and rather plain, only quipped with double bed, a fan and a bathroom (which was instead large and spacious). What we loved though was the access to the lagoon deck and the common area with the camping attached to the hostel. The deck has sunbeds and hammocks, providing space to relax in the sun and to mingle with other travellers. Staff was gentle and helpful. Good WI-FI in the rooms and common area/garden. Y"
"Excelente atención, muy atentos a que necesitas abierto a opiniones. Instalaciones padrisimas, excelente comida en su restaurante!, Es un Hotel prácticamente nuevo. Acceso al la Laguna para nadar. Personal muy amable ellos te ayudan a coordinar Tours."
Prachtige locatie! Heel mooi aangelegd. Ruime schone kamers. Vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Lekkere cocktails.  Het inclusieve ontbijt is erg eenvoudig. Dat had wat uitgebreider gemogen. Verder echt een aanrader! Uitstekende prijs/kwaliteit verhouding
What ever you do never stay at this hotel there was rat poop on the pillows and bugs and salamanders in the rooms. My daughter and her boyfriend were completely grossed out. After 40 minutes we decided to leave and they refused to refund our money.   We found several better places for the same price nearby without bugs and rats. The A/C units are all destroyed no grills but seem to be working.  If you stay here it is at your own risk.
We had a 2 night stay here and it was very comfortable. The room itself was small but very modern with great wifi and bathroom facilities. Free coffee right outside my room which was a win for my partner. The only down side was we were on the ground level and it was quite noisy at night. There was a lot of noise from kids (toddlers) around 11pm which was odd but lots of chatting aswell which disturbed our sleep a bit. If you’re not on the ground floor I’m sure it’s not an issue though. Good stay otherwise.
Nice clean rooms and pool. Location ok. A 5 min walk to Centro and Balsinaro municipal. Comfortable beds. Breakfast ok so for the price: Perfect! Try the good street food just across the street. Tacueria Mucho. Great food cheap. Quesadila or Torta (sandwich) 30$.
"This is my favorite place in Mexico, the lagoon is amazing and the hostel was the perfect complement! We were around 20 friends in this place and we didn't sleep because we made a party at its dock, we played, sang, danced and drink all night long! Everything was perfect!!! "
"Sehr nettes Hotel. Schöne Anlange mit Lagunenzugang, etwas außerhalb des Zentrums (Gehstrecke 25 Minuten oder Taxi 50 Pesos). Sehr saubere Zimmer!  Das Personal war immer überaus freundlich und zuvorkommend! Sehr leckere Cocktails. Frühstück ist recht einfach, aber man kann sich a la carte dazu bestellen.  Ich würde definitiv wieder kommen!"
"Though the bungalow we rented for the 5 of us was a little ""shabby"" by American standards, the beds slept well, the AC was greatly appreciated, the restaurant's food was what we wanted.  The managment was anxious to please and gracious.  Then we rented, for a very nominal price, a pair of kayaks so we could go out on the ""Lagoon of 7 colors"".  We also swam there.  This is an older place, slightly campy (do people still use that term?) and not at all fake or plasticy."
"Very clean hotel, everything is very close, like the Fuerte de San Felipe, the lagoon and the cenotes. Staff is very friendly and they also have tours available at a very affordable price. Parking available but very limited"
"The good points are - the price - the location not far away from city center - it was clean  Now the bad things. The breakfast was horrible. They have only two different things to eat to choose from and both weren't good. Coffee is not drinkable. Our room did not have a real window, pretty dark inside. bathroom needs to be updated. WIFI does only work inside the reception building.  It was good enough to stay there for one night but i was happy to leave the next day as well."
"The hostel has a great breakfast with two options, offers camping spots, bike and kayak rent services, and has its own private access to the lagoon.  The beds have kind of tent to protect you from the mosquitoes, and there are kitchens to cook your own food as well!  Recommended!"
"When we arrived, it was at night, there was no sign or illumination to indicate the hotel entrance, so it was tricky to find. The front desk did not have our reservation (we did book through Expedia, so it is likely their fault and not the Hotel). They did put us in a room, but the room had a backed up drain so the room smelled of feces most of the time we were there. There was also a party boat outside playing loud music all night, the hotel had no interest in getting the boat to turn the music down.  When"
Good enough location just a 10 min walk and you're in the water. Same for restaurants etc. Room was spacious and clean with ac and youtube and netflix with the cable tv. Not that we spent any time indoors anyway. Free coffee and water in the lobby and parking out front. Friendly and helpful staff.  
"My family and I went for vacation and we did not have a reservation. We found this hotel on last minute and in reasonable price 700 MXP here are the things that went well  - good location around 10 minutes to the laguna and center where is the park - the rooms were clean, our room had TV and air conditionary - It has outside pool  the only thing I didn't like was the Breakfast. It was included but the service was very slow. there were a lot of people and only one coffe machine and did not work very well. th"
"The rooms were boiling and full of bugs, all beds had mosquito nets but all had holes in, only a few fans in the room which are not powerful so only reach the person next to you. The beds are a foot away from each other so no space for your bag or anything. Everything felt dirty. The toilet doors had holes down the middle so you could see in. The only good thing was the pontoon which was gorgeous and very nice to hang out at to avoid the rest of the hostel"
"Good view, but the photos look different than it really is. The hotel looks like they have not been maintained on time. The room was deteriorated, there were ants on the bed, lizards on the wall inside the room.  I didn't feel comfortable. I will not return to the hotel."
"We had 2 nights at El Roble on our 4 month travelling trip around central and South America. The hotel itself is nice, we had a giant king size bed, aircon, a little fridge - all luxuries that are appreciated when your travelling on a relatively tight budget.  HOWEVER. Next doors yard backed straight onto our window. As soon as we got into the room, we noticed a lot of dog barking, but this was nothing compared to the screeching Rooster next to our window. EVERY. 20. SECONDS.  Within 10 minutes we asked to "
Better than many other budget hotel beds/pillows. Shower/bath was same. Must remember to turn on the water heater in the am to get a hot shower. Was quiet and east walk to the centro. Excellent restaurant there on the opposite side (didn't write down the name). Not a beach town but quiet nice town. would go back to explore more. Breakfast included. Scrambled eggs/fruit. Very nice. Local attraction..Lagoon of 7 colors...do it!!! But use a recommended licensed tour. We didn't and although it was a great exper
"I found out about this place through word of mouth as they are not on Hostelworld, and I am so glad I did! Had the best stay at Magic Bacalar. The staff are friendly and helpful. Facilities are gorgeous and the private doc with hammocks and seating is incredible. Breakfast is nice and decent portions, toast with jam or eggs and beans along with fruit, juice and coffee. So happy to have stayed here and absolutely recommend! A little way from town but walking distance to bus stops (15mins), but you come here "
"Sadly, the only thing we enjoyed about this hotel was the View. We had a lovely patio, but there were no chairs inside or outside to enjoy the outdoor spaces, the beds uncomfortable and old. We were there for 2 days..There’s was no internet at all, A very small area below by the busy tour boats to swim in the lagoon, the pool was drained and the hotel is in terrible shape! "
Enjoyed my stay!! Miguel (La Sirena) was an amazing entertainer he was funny very friendly and down to earth person! Israel was amazing as well! Staff was friendly and hotel was clean! Beautiful place will definitely come back!
 cawing. It was beyond infuriating!!!!  So I would recommend the hotel but only if they can offer you a room on the opposite side to the Rooster yard!! 
"A reasonable option. A business-like welcome rather than super friendly but OK nonetheless. Clean rooms, about 10 minutes or so walk to the main square. Breakfast was included but it was nothing to get excited about - scrambled eggs and a tiny portion of refried beans. One morning I was mildly amused to see the reception staff tucking into the same but slightly bigger portions, with the addition of a bowl of fruit salad. Hire bikes available but they deparately need some maintenace. Better to get a bike som"
"I will totally recommend this hostel for young people, couples or families .... the view is amazing, the location is not far from the bar´s area. You have to wake up early to witness the beautiful sunrise from their amazing and super comfortable wooden dock and the best part is that they have a very nice price if you decide to camp. "
"I have been coming to Hotel Laguna since early 1990s before Bacalar was a tourist desitnation.  Back then it was beautiful, clean, and well kept.  Unfortunately, it has gone down.  Even though the hotel is in a gorgeous location overlooking the lagoon, the rooms have literally gone to hell.  They smell, the bathrooms are dirty and ill kept.  Our sink only had the hot water faucet that worked.  We found used razors on top of the shower stall and there were gecko droppings everywhere.  The staff...except for "
Israel  and herbey and Miguel AKA la sirena are very awesome and very outgoing really know how to get the party going!! Definitely coming back hoping to see them again! Muy buenas personas! Don’t change guys!

"Im a person who always goes to hostels and in used to this but i have to say that besides the laguna and the deck that this hostel has... the rest of it is disgusting. The rooms are gross, no a/c. The lockers are outside the room. So every time we needed something from our luggage we had to go outside right next to the outdoor kitchen.. and the night i was there it rained and i got all wet because the lockers are not in the room. Everything looks very old, they should remodel the hostel. The reception is no"

"I don't have enough good things to say about our stay at Casa Shiva. The friendliness, flexibility, and warmth of the staff,  and the location and layout of the docks and the rooms on the property made for a really amazing time. They allowed us to hire external providers and did not try to predatorily charge us as soon as we mentioned ""wedding"" like so many other venues do. They resolved our requests in an honest, friendly, and accommodating manner. I also appreciated that the staff were available for you b"
"Visited the Mia Reef Hotel for 5 days and I had a great time. The activity staff (Miguel, Yoshi and Kaibear) did an amazing job getting the members involved in daily events from bike tours to beach volleyball. Our waiters Luis and Enoc were super friendly and attentive while we relaxed on the beach. Luis introduced us to a new drink which was our choice for the remainder of our stay. I would definitely recommend this place. The night shows were entertaining and catered to all ages."
We stayed here for 6 nights in a double room last week. It will seem at first from a map that it is a bit out of the way but you will realise that bacalar is a very small place and everything is close by!  Max 5 minute walk to balneario municipal our favourite public access to the Laguna and say 10ish minutes to the park square which is near the fuerte de San Felipe and restaurants. There are local shops very close to the hotel for getting basics like water.  There are two small outdoor seating areas which 
" borrow our charged pretending he wasn't  doing anything wrong and he even said.. it only charged 7% he had it there for over an hour. And we even saw that this other person was using out charger. He lied in out faces. Not nice at all. They have outdoor bathroom which were ok. After all the only thing we enjoyed was the laguna. I have to recognize  that its in a perfect spot, the water is perfect  there and so is the deck.  If you don't care about how you are going to sleep then this is the place to go, if "

" (it was serviceable and I suspect this is rather a regional issue rather than hotel-specific) and some wood on the dock will probably need to be replaced in the next 5 years. Of course, this didn't detract from our experience, thanks again so much for helping make our wedding and family get-together an unforgettable experience."

Final shout out to Manuel the staff member that worked on reception during our staff during the day. He mainly spoke Spanish but was very patient with my partner practising his Spanish and encouraged him and helped his confidence. Manuel is such a friendly man we even chatted with him for a while on the front porch about anything and everything. The staff don't

"Is a small place, a bit old but really beautiful is excellent if you are looking for a relax environment this is a perfect place!! The sunrise and sunset are beautiful!! If you stay here you will need taxi or to rent a car to move cause is a bit far from the town that is very nice and worth to visit. The food at the hotel is 100% home made and is delicious!! "

"I reserved a double room, bath shared(i hadnt noticed when I reserved) and when I arrived, lo and behold, it was not a room but a bloody tent in the courtyard :-))) could you believe it? See the picture. Additionally wifi only works in the common areas, not in the room, ehm tent. The tent has no restroom, so please be EXTREMELY careful when you reserve with them"
"Staff was better than any other stay, Miguel is Numero uno. Hergey, Israel Joshi we're excellent as well for entertainment every day without fail. Pool is always clean, food was pretty good as well. Would stay again."
Dream location right on lagoon edge. Fantastic swimming in clear warm water. Has own jetty where you can sunbathe or relax in the shade in a hammock.  Friendly staff. Our room was private upstairs.  Was small and lacked natural light. Breakfast mediocre. No hot water in showers. No real cooking facilities. Wifi only worked in dining area. Bathrooms very clean.  Would recommend mainly due to the hidden gem that is Laguna Bacalar.
"I stayed in a bungalow steps away from the lake. The location of the hotel is great, right on the lake and not too far from the city center. 2 nights the power went out. The second night they sent us to a sister hotel since the power wouldn’t be fixed till the morning. That hotel was definitely not as good as Casa Shiva though. The hotel is beautiful inside and out.

"It may sound too good to be true, but from the moment Odette picked up my  dodgy-looking skype call from Zambia and really tuned in to our conversation we knew that we were talking to someone that truly wanted us to feel home, free and at ease.  We rented the whole property for a week for our close family and planned to celebrate our wedding on Saturday. Pandemic not really planned for, there ended up being many changes, but what was constant was Odette`s support and good vibes - Need microphone? She got it"
"Visited this beautiful paradise and fell in love with its breathtaking beauty. The Mia Hotel is located on a tiny island off Isla Mujeres' Playa Norte, which is the best beach on the Island. You are able to walk for meters in the shallow, clear waters of the lagoon like beach, and see colorful fish swimming at your feet. Needless to say pictures don't do this place justice.  The staff were friendly and very attentive.  We had an amazing time partaking in the daily activities. The Island bike tour with Migue"
" Casa Shiva is truly stunning but what makes it worth it is Odette`s, Miguel`s and all the crew´s warmth. They were so approachable that we ended up feeling we`d been friends forever and invited them to our weeding.  Thank you for making our time as smooth as it could be in these uncertain times. ¡Hasta la próxima!"

"We are 20-year veterans of this amazing place. From an abandoned property in the late 1990's to well-funded all-inclusive, the present secluded private space offers one of the best beaches and ocean views in the Mexican Riviera. Migrating terns have chosen an area on this Islotte to mate and bring forth their young and the resort has given them sanctuary. The only substantive issue remaining is the mismanagement of noise and ""entertainment"". There are daily offerings with 10 - 15 participants involving acti"
"Si tu intención es descansar y relajarte en Bacalar, este hotel es SIN DUDA TU ELECCIÓN. Las estancias alrededor de laguna son algo ruidosas en la noche por los eventos y/o excesivamente costosas.  Si bien este hotel esta cruzando la avenida, en su lugar estarás descansando entre la vegetación propia de la zona en unas cabañas vintage minimalistas pero de las cuales el dueño no escatimó para tu descanso.

Situated very close to the swimming lagoons in Bacalar. This hotel is also withing walking distance of the major sites and city center. The hotel is well priced and is quite new.  It has a good swimming pool with comfortable furniture around it.  The rooms were very clean and air conditioned.  It was a worry couple of days that we stayed.
"Encantador, limpio y amigable Altamente recomendable el servicio es personalizado, amigable y excelentes recomendaciones de parte José Luis, el es el mejor!!! Habitaciones limpias, cómodas y muy linda decoración. Tienes que hospedarte en este hotel boutique 🏨"
"Hotel was good, staff was friendly, the pool is small and has 4 beds for the entire hotel but enough. Main attraction is Laguna bacalar so theres very low use of the pool. Location is good, walking distance to the centre."
"I have to be honest and say I was NOT expecting an apartment-type room. That was a little disappoining at first, realizing that there was no restaurant on site and all our meals had to be outside (there was no way we were going to cook, to be honest). Having said that, turns out it was not bad at all! There are a lot of places nearby where you can eat, from nice upscale kinda food to super cheap street stalls.  The hotel is super well located, the rooms are huge and super comfortable with great views of the"

The chef made a nice breakfast every morning which was included. Everyday when we got back, our room was nicely cleaned. They keep the pool and the surrounding area clean throughout the day. We could lend towels to go to Los Rapidos and José arranged the sailing tour for us. Price per night is around 70/75 usd a night. Great value for money. If we vi"
Great accomodation. Very clean and stylish rooms in the middle of beautiful garden.celan and large pool.  Pefect place to stay at the Bacalar area. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Breakfasts were more than delicious. We would definitely come again.
"If you like peace & quiet in the middle of the jungle, thus is for you. Not if you are looking for luxury. Almost like a secret place. Found out about it from a native who was selling freshly squeezed juices. Passivity a good place to stay if you go to los rapids, tolum & puerto Morelos."
"Great location, nice rooms, clean great pool space. Everyone cleaners is really nice except...one guy on the front desk. We stayed here for 8 nights and initially didn't have a booking so we had to change rooms a couple times (completely understand, had no problem with this) Santiago on the front desk whenever we asled to stay extra nights always was really rude and disinterested making it out like it was a real hastle for him to book us in again. We were paying in advance, moving our own bags but he just l"

"The rooms are 250 meters from the lake, up on a hill in the jungle. It is hot and humid and they only provide a small, useless old mini fan which is very loud. We had construction going on directly behind our room etc... The dock is small and this place is far from town. My coffee this morning had cinnamon put in it. (Worst coffee I have never drunk). I asked for a normal coffee and the staff refused to make a pot with cinnamon in it.  Find a different place to stay."
"Everything is perfect: great helpful personnel that speaks proper English and good facilities with great carribean look.   Except: we slept very badly twice, because of many barking dogs all night long!! In the morning the roosters and some birds take over. We slept on the 1st floor, but others on the ground floor didn’t hear it this load, so make sure to book a room on the ground floor!"

"A wonderfull place for relaxing in an extreme comfortable and cozy place. The warmth and attentions of its manager Jose Luis make you feel supported, secure and at home in the place.  Wifi works ok and maintenance and cleaning are excellent. No doubt in visiting Zensus again."

"Thank you Eric for sharing your experience and your love of nature! We loved that kayak excursion ! We had the opportunity to see a beautiful sunset, an amazing environment, only birds noise....and nice surprises there;)))"
"Nice little hotel in a great location with a little pool.  It's very spacious and comfortable.  It's within walking distance of just about everything except the bus station, but that's only a 20-25 peso taxi ride away.  The front desk clerk spoke perfect English. My only complaint was the cash-only policy. But they did let us check in and then go visit the ATM to pay for our room."
"Had the best night sleep. Spacious rooms. Lovely smelling toiletries, great shower. The pool is refreshing and looks out over the lake. Excellent WiFi. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great location especially close to LA Pina restaurant where we had a scrumptious LA Pina pizza and chicken tacos with a banana smoothy. A great experience all round. Great off the street car parking. Would definitely recommend this accommodation. "
"Situated on the Laguna Bacalar, this eco resort offers very spacious and comfortable accommodations. The palapas are spread around tastefully maintained grounds that keep down the bugs and allow some privacy. Invest in the morning bird watch, we actually saw a toucan. Be sure to swim in the lake."
"The Azulejo 36 is a nice property on the middle of town. My friends, wife and I had two rooms. The rooms were simply decorated and there is construction on a new building on the property but the noise ceased at 6 PM.  The room is sparsely furnished with a bed, 2 end tables and tiny desk and chair but it is spotlessly clean. The walls are mostly bare but there are two small pictures on one wall.  There is a television.   You won’t go wrong staying at Azulejo 36.  A word of caution- the hotel does not accept "
Perfect place to stay in Bacalar. Clean and organized. Great location inside the town. Very close to the center of town. We had an amazing time. Good price. Definitely recommend. Go to this hotel and you will not regret.
"We did not expect that we booked an apartment, with an own kitchen. If you ask at the reception, a staff member will open the gate to Avenida 1, from where you can easily reach the laguna or restaurants. Staff was very polite and helpful."

The room has no airconditioning so for non Mexicans who are not used the heat, it was definitely not an easy overnight. Because of them being ecofriendly - you dont get drinking water (bottles) in the room and that we could of used that night!  Next night lesson learnt and we bought ourselves enough water which made the night more pleasant   Also note if you do not have a car, the"

We had a lovely stay. The room is nice and clean. Sunbed at the swimming pool and the whole day sun. The staff want to help but Most of them can’t speak proper English. Restaurants at walking distance. 
" Indians, the Spaniard conquistadors, the pirates and this amazing place. We ate at the restaurant 2nd floor on the north side of the plaza and the service was the fastest we have had in Mexico. The margaritas, food and price were great too. The lagoon of Bacalar was perfect temperature even if it was super windy. Many told us that the Bacalar boat tour is a great experience, but the wind was so strong and we decided that we will have to come back for that. Make sure to swim, the Water is wonderful. "
"It was all good, macarena was the best the food was delicious and we had a great time there. I really recommend the yak lake house hostel for everybody who is coming to visit bacalar and the amazing lagoon"

"When you want to relax from the party scene of your trip head to Bacalar and enjoy this amazing town and hotel.  Agam is a cool small 17 room hotel with a chill vibe.  Close to everything and also within walking distance to the town center, lagoon and many bars.  Enjoy a drink by the pool with chill music.  The owner and staff are very helpful."
"The hostel is right by the lake so you have an amazing view from the hostel. The staff is super friendly (definitely Macarena at reception!) and they organise lots of activities. If you like some good vibes and also want a good night sleep, this is the place to be."
"A small collection of bungalows on the edge of the beautiful lagoon of Bacalar.  I loved the quietness... the privacy... the informality. At least two dozen birds on the property... lovely to hear their songs during daylight hours. Large bungalows, each one with a hammock on the porches (there should be two hammocks instead of just one).  Kayaks provided without charge. Two piers for jumping off of or just sitting or lying on.  Large common area for breakfasts (delicious and included) and wi-fi charging.  T"
"A good-looking establishment close to town with lovely views across to the laguna.  Rooms well-kept, clean and functional although starting to show some ageing.  Staff pleasant enough, breakfast was mediocre.  The drama?.... At 05.00 a.m. we were woken by an intruder. They had opened the glass sliding window beside our bed and were in the process of climbing into our room. I scared them off and  reported the incident to reception.  They didn't seem to care, so we left, shaken, but not stirred."
"Extremely friendly and nice staff. We stayed here for two nights to explore the area, we got great recommendations and felt very well accommodated. Location is quite, parking easy on the street, rooms come with AC and a nice bathroom. Last but not least you can enjoy the pool and garden.  Totally exceeded our expectations."
"Amazing hostel, lots of activities organized every day and every evening, great to meet people and the bar doesn't close too late so you can sleep (or continue to party in the city).  Highly recommend doing a sailing trip on the lagoon, and the kayak sunset outing was also super fun.  The cherry on the stay was definitely Macarena, so sweet and helpful with anything you need!"
"Ecotucan Bacalar was the worst place we have stayed in Mexico, and we are a Mexican and American couple and travel through out the country. It claims to be ECO but that is just a term used to replace CHEAP! The rooms do not have AC , ok so they give you a little fan no bigger then your palm that is louder then the whole jungle. They dont give you any water in the room at all and you can't even charge your cell phone in the room. It is on the outskirts of Bacalar and far from town. The entrance is dark and c"
"Stayed here last weekend with my wife & two kids. Large two bedroom unit each with private rooms. Rooms outdated with spartan furnishings, but clean. Small clean and inviting pool. Fully furnished kitchen, again mostly outdated. I paid $3,200 pesos which is a bit pricey for the area. Very nice accommodating staff, with Juan particularly very attentive to our needs. Breakfast was included in the rate. A good coat of paint would improve the room a great deal. Would stay again as not a lot of options in Bacala"
"This hotel has everything you need. The comfort, boho chic vibe, fresh pool, delicious and complete breakfast, great location but most of all amazing customer service. We were a group and the owner made sure that everything ran smoothly for us, besides the staff being on point.   I would go back to this hotel without thinking about it twice!"
"I had such amazing moments at the Yak Lake House. The hostel is very clean, secure and worth the stay! Best place for a solo traveller to meet new people from around the world! There are many activities scheduled everyday that will make you discover Bacalar and have some fun at night! The employees are very friendly and thoughtful. Special thanks to Andrea, Yajhab, Dani and David, the activities were amazing and my stay wouldn’t have been the same without them! I will be back at the Yak if I am ever in Baca"
" on the phone with booking trying to get another  negative review removed, rather then trying to improve the conditions. The whole ECO vibe was ruined when the grounds workers had piles of trash on the side of the dirt road on the way in. SAVE YOURSELF THE ORDEAL AND STAY IN TOWN. No literature or maps or any info what so all is provided to help guest enjoy their stay. THE ROOM LITERALLY FELT LIKE WE WERE SLEEPING IN A BRICK OVEN , WHICH RUINED OUR NEXY DAY BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SLEEP. HIGHLY DO NOT "
"We spent 4 nights with my husband and his family in the hotel. We got good breakfast, recommendations of places to visit. All the receptionist are super nice and helpful. The hotel is clean and the prices are good.  Best choice!"
"Loved my stay here. Very clean, comfortable beds, amazing view, great activities (for free or small price), lovely staff/volunteers (Macarena, Laura, Kails, Patrick, Oli). Bacalar has a great vibe thanks to all the people there. I would definitely come back and book earlier in advance. Prices go up when you wait. Enjoy your stay here!"
From the moment you walk in everything is amazing!  The reception desk is one of a kind.  Just past the reception desk is an amazing view of the lake and courtyard.  The courtyard is where it is at!  Get a tan and relax during the day to get ready for the nightly activities!  The staff were very friendly and kept the hostel spotless.  They have several activities you can purchase at reasonable prices.
"This boutique hotel is an absolute oasis!  Everything was considered when designing this hotel... it's a vibe!  From the breathtaking infinity pool to the lush greenery, you can't help but feel like you're in a jungle paradise.  The staff is warm, welcoming and super helpful.  Plus, total bonus that the breakfast is 5 stars (buffet of fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and beverages + hot breakfast to order).   Also the location is close to great restaurants, the lake and the main strip."
"How can I start, the yak lake house is the best hostel I have visited in my time in Mexico. Viri, Dan and Pedro made my time really special. They were very welcoming and hospitable. I would encourage you to come stay and I would to come back very soon."
"Excellent hostel right on the lake. There were plenty of fun activities in the evening and the staff, especially Viri, Sharon and Pedro couldn’t have done more to make us feel welcome! You also get a welcome cocktail which i could not complain about! Would thoroughly recommend!"
"My stay in a hotel was lovely! I enjoyed Bacalar activities and after had a nice rest in a room, was swimming in a pool after breakfast. Oh!  It was very relaxing and I would love to go back one day! Also breakfast was good, with some fruits, granola chia, omelette and avo toast options!!"
"Bacalar itself is already such a beautiful place, the yak make a much better experience,  the food is great (sebastian, Rafa, Adrian they have an increible knowledge about food) , the view is magnificent, the ambiance is so much fun (Aaron is a great bartender who know his way around with making great drinks) , at the front desk Valeria and Esequiel are helpful and friendly. 100% recommended"
"Agam boutique hotel is the perfect place to find a peace of mind This hotel is beautiful quite and has good service to offer : renting bikes , daily tours in the lagoon and very delicious breakfast. I highly recommend it"
"I stayed at yak for over two weeks, and I had an amazing time. It’s definitely a party hostel but since bacalar is still a relatively off the beaten track destination the party level is acceptable.  The staff is amazing!! Viri specially hosts a bike ride to the cenotes and it’s awesome.   Thanks!!!"
"New and wonderful hotel! The design is beautiful, great pool and garden.  Everything is clean and very comfortable.  Nice staff in the reception.   Was very happy to stay there. Great choice in Bacalar!!!"
"wonderful new hotel in Bacalar.  everything was great.  rooms wonderful, desing beautiful and harmonious, lighting awesome and atmospheric, garden comfortable, hanging swings where you can relax, pool really clean.  breakfast absolutely gorgeous.  staff super and manager absolutely gorgeous"
"New small hotel in Bacalar. Cozy atmosphere and very good service. Clean and very comfortable room and common areas. Breakfast is inexpensive and really good. Everything is perfect, including the hotel manager. Thanks for everything. I recommend!"
"Went for the weekend, The lagoon is beautiful, your about 10 minutes from downtown. As soon as you arrive everything starts going downhill.   Restauran - They have no sense as to what is gourmet food, well presented and exquisite. The waiters are very kind but they walk around with hair coverings and worn out uniforms and shoes. You feel like you are in an expensive Mexican fonda. They have no real knowledge as that a vegetarian is. Dishes are not of high quality nor well presented. Actual dinnerware is eve"
" picks up garbage for service.   Pool cushions are plastic cushions, so weird and always they are very dirty with mold.   Internet is very spotty going on and off. Somedays it went offline for 6-8 hours couldn't get work done and without the hotel ever advising you.   There is no way to communicate with front desk, they should at-least have an WhatsApp business account to communicate with them professionally.   The only thing I would say i stayed in a remodeled room along the water and it was alright and ni"
…
Thanks to the staff. Great visit and the lagoon is lovely. Hoping the pressure from tourism on the environment is managable! Really lovely spot and recommend the options with private docks. Lots of outdoor living space on the grounds and in the rooms.
"Our room had a quiet, discreet back garden with deck chairs and a direct access to the water.   The hotel also has a long jetty into the lagoon, where you can stay for a sunbath, or to access the water to swim or board a motorboat.  The property is located in a quiet area of the lagoon, relatively far from the village. Take advantage of the kayak offered by the hotel to explore the surroundings, but a private boat trip to see the cenotes and the pirate channel is very recommended - you will fully appreciate"
" are almost a full day trip, but worth it."
…
Love the place even though we felt a little restricted to the hotel. Love having use of kayaks and paddleboards. Boat trip fine and easy to organise. Hammocks swings so nice. Restaurant is ok. Rooms are nice.
"We had the most amazing holiday in Mexico and Bacalar was by far the quietest spot, exactly what we needed. This place is off the beaten path, with comfortable rooms and great staff, the food was excellent. Definitely have huevos motuleños and take the kayak one day to explore the surroundings, you'll remember this place forever."
"We spent a few nights in a master suite facing the lagoon. It was a beautiful room, probably the nicest we stayed in the whole trip. The hotel itself was wonderful. It was quiet and secluded, yet close enough to Bacalar town that it wasn't inconvenient. The food was amazing as was the staff. We would definitely recommend the hotel and would stay there again if we return to Bacalar."
"Everything from the beginning was perfect, Easy check in,  Rooms are really clean and beautiful,  i came to realx and chill and it was exactly what i was looking for,  Food is great, Erick and Antonio where really great.  Thanks for everything, coming soon for sure!"
We stayed 3 nights here as family. Hotel grounds are beautiful by the beautiful lagoon. Kids enjoyed very much jumping from the jetty and the lovely pool. Room size was very good with 2 double beds and a nice terrace. It is not advisable though to leave your door open due to mosquitoes and natural habitat as there are no nets. We found the bed and pillows really uncomfortable and had the worst sleep during our 12d tour compared to 4 other hotels we stayed in- even a basic hotel. There is no choice of pillow
"The place is awesome, great service, great food, great price.  The spa is a great place to relax with the massage and the staff is very profesional.  The views from the rooms is great you have an ocean view.  The pool is nice and you only have to walk 150ft. To the beach.  Love the place we will be back next year   "
" has plenty of lovely cafes and restaurants as well as plenty of boat tours on the fabulous lagoon. Arely in the reception is lovely, speaks good English and super helpful.  Our experience with hotel receptions we stayed in during our trip to Mexico was different than other travels we had in other countries,  it felt somewhat distant and impersonal. But overall an excellent stay and Bacalar worth a few days of visit."
We took 14 travelers to this beautiful and peaceful boutique hotel on the Costa Esmeralda. The hotel management is top notch. They greeted our group with local fruit wine spritzers and helped everyone get into their suites promptly. We had a delicious and well managed lunch and our travelers had time to walk the beach or swim in the lovely pool. Rooms are spacious with views of the ocean. Everyone in our group wanted to stay for a week! The Costa Esmeralda had beautiful beaches but not that many good hotels
"The concept is to have all the confort from your own apartment in the middle of the manglar. And it does succeed. Bacalar Lagoon is beautiful but off course it can be a challenge if you are not used to mosquitos, heat, etc. Normally it takes some time to adapt to those changes in climate. If you are there for a few days then MBH solves that for you by giving you top notch rooms in the midst of it. How they set it up is also very nice. Every building has 4 apartments or Rooms and shares a hot tube and steam "
…
"This is a luxury boutique hotel, situated on the lake at the end of a 2km access dirt road and about 15mins drive from Bacalar Town. It's brand new so everything looks great, the rooms are well designed and the beds are particularly comfortable. The surroundings are stunning, the views from the rooms are great and you can really feel the relative isolation of being away from everything and in the midst of the jungle. Service was exceptional, there was nothing that was too much for them.   This isn't for eve"
"This beautiful hotel boutique is located in a quiet and peaceful area in Bacalar, 9 minutes from downtown area. We had such an amazing time in here, all the staff were very friendly and quick to respond to any of our requests during the stay, they went above and beyond the expectations. The room was super clean, the view from the roof garden was just perfect, also the restaurant is great, we had a culinary experience every time.  Also, we had so much fun with all the amenities, biking, kayaking and jacuzzi "
I arrived at the hotel payed a room like the one advertised on IG the room they gave me at first had no privacy whatsoever.  I was talking to a woman named Silvia which was somewhat rude she was taking her time while I waited soaking wet with the tropical heat with no room. they made me wait for 2 hours until finally I was able to talk to the sales rep who was understanding and nice. They changed my room I was able to enjoy from the pool for a while and when I went back to take a shower there where roaches 
"The staff makes you feel so welcomed from the moment you arrive.  Everything is clean and tidy, the garden has a lot of plants so you can chill in the shade.  There are 3 roof top terraces (for meditation / yoga, to socialize and to exercise and watch the laguna).  Rooms are clean, you get local products for the shower, proper blackout curtains and comfy bed for those who want to rest.  You can get the breakfast at the hotel, water and tea is available during the whole day and is included.  They can arrange"
"The hotel is an excellent place to unwind and center yourself with mother nature again. location is great, 10-minute drive to 7 colors lagoon, and to the town where you can do shopping. Make sure you take mosquito repellent if you are going to eat at the restaurant during the night, the ceviche and aguachilies are to die for here... They have paddleboards, kayaks, and bikes for you to use at no additional cost. Staff members are fantastic."
" wasn’t from the hotel ( I don’t mind dogs at all) in the hotel rules It also stated that you couldn’t bring food or drinks from outside next morning a large group arrived with 2 dogs and coolers with drinks and food... when I checked out they told me they where friends and family from the owner so they were allowed....   #1 It’s a shame that they have people like Silvia working in the hotel, cause the food at the restaurant is really good and the servers are super nice, the girl at reception is also very s"
" has 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a bird:) It feels like home and all guests mirror the atmosphere, socialize with each other and being polite answer kind too.   If I come back to Bacalar, I definitely will stay here.   Ps Wifi works well, location is really good!"
"Friendly, attentive, great value. Huge rooms, very clean. Smack in the best location in town. Definitely will be coming back! Steve and his staff were as accommodating as it gets, and they even have us extra information as to how to get around and where to go."
We ended up here after leaving other unsuitable accommodations. It is located about 5km outside of the town of Bacalar. Such a tranquil peaceful location.  We stayed in one of the two buildings with lake views. Wonderful spacious room and comfortable bed with fridge and patio over looking the lake. The onsite restaurant is exceptional. Enjoyed every meal we had there. The service is excellent. We do not normally eat on site at hotels/resorts - but glad we did here.  They have young inspired chefs doing a gr

This is such a quiet and clean space! Just two blocks down from the fort. I came for my brother’s wedding and was amazed at the space; perfect for family. The balcony has a great table to sit and play board games or eat a nice breakfast. And it’s just a short 2 min walk to the center of town where there is food and keepsakes. I will definitely come here again :)
"What I liked:  The room is nice.  The bed was comfortable.  The view was outstanding.  The waterfront area was very relaxing.  The food was excellent, literally worth every penny.  The service was stellar.  What needs improvement… in filling the hot tub, the hot water ran out.  The rooftop bar (2 buildings over) was a little loud.  I’m not sure having the bar and the rooms so close was the best design but aside from that there is a wonderfully peaceful, sunrise, relax on the water type vibe.  I found the pr"
"The most disappointing of stays. The hotel is in very poor condition particularly the outside areas... rotten wood around the pool, rusty chairs on verandah and weeds and debris everywhere. There was noisy building work near by our room so we were moved to a different room which also had a new path under construction right outside. The front of house staff did not explain anything in our room so we were left to figure out electric curtains, lighting etc. Considering we paid over US$ 300 per night we wanted "
"We were the very first guests at the Taboga Eco hotel upon their reopening due to the pandemic.    Upon arrival, and the entire weekend, the owners and staff were working tirelessly to keep the entire resort clean.    This started from when we got out of the car to check in, and they sprayed down our luggage, to the room, with all towels sealed in plastic, and continued throughout.    Everything was extremely clean and safe.  Aside from the care and dedication that was shown regarding cleanliness, we really"
We really enjoyed our stay there. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Pool area is nice and clean. The rooms are well furnsihed and clean as well. We would definitely come back to this amazing place.
"We liked this hotel with their helpful staff, parking at the hotel, and large room. It was quite damp in our room probably because of the rock construction. However the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was okay. We didn't eat breakfast there as they had only brunches that week (Holy Week) and we prefer smaller meals. Overall, a good choice if you don't mind a little dampness."
"This is the perfect spot in Bacalar. Superb service and location, with great quality lodging. This hotel made us feel at home, it has everything you need for an amazing holidays… and it’s just a couple of blocks from everything, and the price is the best part.   We would recommend the hotel without a doubt, and we are coming back to Bacalar and to the Hotel & Suites Oasis.   Gracias por todo!"
" description provided.  Without a doubt, I will return, but I’ll pass on the tour."
"The hotel is very nice and clean, but the service is not amazing. Poor communication between reception/restaurant (they did not know we paid stuff to the restaurant and kept calling for money), waiting time at arrival as reception was empty, + min 15mins to check out to check the minibar although we said we were in a hurry, and they even thought we took something from the minibar - which we didn’t! Room is nice and clean but in places like the bathroom it doesn’t look like it’s maintained well. Prices at US"
" Veracruz and to be very clear, this is not a major resort area.  If you are looking for a nightclub and a $15 dollar cocktail, this is not the location for you.  However, we loved the slightly undeveloped feel and appreciated being in a location that wasn't overrun by spring breaker types like we see in Cancun.    Having spent many years in Mexico, I have always heard that Veracruz was not a great vacation place, but the Taboga hotel was lovely and fully up to my standards, and it was so relaxing because w"
"Loved the warm welcome, the helpful staff, clean rooms, tips for restaurants and great boat trip that we’ve booked via the reception. The room was new, quiet and the shower was warm (that’s not always the case ;))"
It seems to me that this hotel is an old mansion and has a good vibe. The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds. We've had dinner and breakfast and both were good. Good place to stay when in Cuetzalan.
"We stayed in a very cozy and beautiful cabin, with a private terrace with lots of vegetation where you can enjoy a cup of coffee with the sound of the birds.  Inside the cabin you have everything you need, all new and very clean.  We slept very comfortable.  Highly recommended."
…
"The hotel offers cool prices and comfortable beds. Rooms are huge and comfortable for business trips and pleasure too. The room rate includes buffet breakfast in which food is good enough. Room service is quite expensive but affordable, i rather go to the restaurant and save 15% of the total bill."
The hotel is beautiful and the bedrooms very spacious. I had a lake front Grand Jeex suite for me and my wife and a Luxe Saasil suite for my 14 year old and a friend. The first day we were there we went on a boat tour and by the time we got back at 3:30pm the kid's room was made up but ours wasn't. I though it weird but probably due to some glitch so I went to ask and was informed that the maids start from the rooms at the back of the hotel and work their way to the lake front rooms. They got to ours at 5:3
…
"What an amazing experience we have had during our stay. The owners made you feel at home the moment you walked in.   Hotel was very clean, beautiful and on a few min walking distance from the lagoon!  Definitely our best experience we had in Mexico.  A big recommendation for everyone who wants luxury, comfort and a home feeling at once!  "
"Centrally located this hotel is a great place to stay while exploring Cuetzalan. Friendly staff, good breakfasts, beautiful terrace to enjoy end of day conversation. Locally handmade soaps a nice detail."
"Yes I did and my fiancee as well, the room is romantic, spacious and elegant. the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. I hired Andres for a tour around the waterfalls and it was good. There is ONLY one big problem, We stayed at the suite and Sunday morning, around 5 am some guys outside decided to finish their party just in front of the window and was very VERY annoying. Also in this side of the building the windows are about a meter away from the street and there are lots of cars and buses "
"We were staying at another hotel when we stumbled  upon  this cozy place.  A short chat with  the  owner  and we decided to stay in bacalar a few more days to get to know the town better.  The location is great as it is central and close to some very fine restaurants.  Further, it is only one street up from the lagoon so it's quick and easy to get a boat trip on the waters.  The room we had  was clean, spacious and comfy. The pool just outside provided a nice break from the busy beaches of the town.  Staff "
"Excellence everywhere, amenities, customer service, food, location. From the check in to the check out is digital and easy, drinks at the pier, massage to die for and the service is outstanding. The gate is access control with a card. Room service using WhatsApp. Many tours and options around. Nature and comfort at its best. Try it and you won’t regret it."
"The first time I visited Poza Rica for work I thought I would end up in a hotel that although served its purpose, would simply not be a great deal to talk about. To my surprise I was put up in this little gem. It does not look like much from the outside, just a large slab of a hotel, but the hotel is mean to be enjoyed from the inside. The ventilation is well maintained, as it should be in this area with high heat and humidity. The room are very spacious, very well appointed, spotlessly clean and did I ment"
 unacceptable. You come back from your day activities in a 33o celsius heat and want to have a shower and relax in your room before dinner but cannot as they will come into your room at 5pm to clean it. Amazingly enough it was the most expensive room type. Definitely not up to the quality of the installations and price range. A real shame.  Everything else was good and the staff was friendly. Our kids had no complaints.
"The place is just fantastic. It's great for both a romantic couple stay as well as for a family retreat. Cottages are great bamboo houses and the two floor family cabañas are a delight; ample, romantic, fun for the kids, yet offering the parents a secluded space for reading, a drink, and romance. The grounds are week kept, clean and with great opportunities for children to play and adults to relax and lounge. The beach is black but great and very isolated so only used by hotel guests. Just a great place thr"
"Beautiful hotel close to the lagoon.  We felt really welcome thanks to the very friendly host and staff of the hotel. We couldn't think about anything we missed there.   From the rooftop terrace you can see the lagoon a bit and it is only a few minutes walking from the hotel. It is located close to the city center and plenty of options for good restaurants.   We parked the car just next to the hotel, there should be always a spot available close by.  Several options to book a tour directly in the hotel, we "
"When we decided to visit Cuetzalan, we chose the Hotel La Casa de Piedra but had no idea what to expect.  The Hotel La Casa de Piedra was perfect!  This is a beautiful property with an excellent location - one block from the main square - and we were able to walk to dinner each night.  The rooms were clean, the staff members were friendly, and the food (breakfast) was delicious.  We found Cuetzalan to be a charming town and would love to return to visit again.    It's rare to say this but the hotel was nice"
"Bacalar is famous for its beautiful lagoon of seven colours. We came here to sail it and see its three-billion-year-old living rocks, the stromatolites. Apart from the lagoon, we also found that Bacalar is a quaint little Pueblo Mágico sitting on the lakeside filled with wonderful street art and with plenty of 3B (Bueno, Bonito y Barato) eateries.   To our delight, we also found the perfect place to explore all of this from in Oasis. From first meeting with Stevie and Luis in the reception, to the apartment"
"We loved our stay here it’s very quiet and peaceful couple minutes away from centro in Bacalar.. The staff were all so nice & very friendly.. The Room was super clean and the view was amazing!!!

"Loved this place and highly recommend for a family stay, even with small children. We have a 2 year old and 5 month old and we really enjoyed our stay here. Super family friendly hotel, even have a kids table and baby seats available (this is a BIG deal for families with small kids and not something readily available at smaller boutique hotels so we really really really appreciated it). There is a shallow section of the pool which is perfect for kids and they even have a trampoline. We got a room with A/C b"
"The stay at Casa Chukum was very good! The staff was very friendly and the hotel was very nice and classy, to the smallest detail. I enjoyed the pool and the area with the hamock a lot. There was also a lot of fine artwork, very stylish!"
"I've stayed here twice, and enjoy the heritage of the hotel and Cuetzalan. The rooms are spacious and clean, but are not modern. The 'balcony' is an open air corridor , which feels somewhat disingenuous."
"Very Good Boutique Hotel in the heart of Cuetzalan, only 1 block from main square. Rooms are very clean with an excellent design taste. Lots of plants around and very quiet. Staff are super friendly, always trying to help. Breakfast service and food are great too."
 and more. Thank you for your amazing hospitality and hope to see you again one day!
 volveremos ..
"Lovely hotel, beautiful views and great staff who made our experience memorable. Carlos, Alfredo and cesar were especially excellent and charismatic, attending to our every need and making wonderful cocktails. The vista from the hotel restaurant will be a long lasting memory for me."
" around 6am and I know in our case, our son was already starving by 8am when food orders were just being taken. Other families that we talked to there agreed, some even had kids wake up at 5am (very normal with young kids). Other than that, thank you so much to the kind staff who made us feel so welcome and at home."
Very cute little hotel in Bacalar. They offer boat tours to go sailing on the lagoon. Something I can definitely recommend! Other tours use larger motor boats but we've used a sailing boat hosting 6 pax. Which was much more enjoyable.   Staff was great as well! We only stayed 2 nights unfortunately but felt like home :)
"Casa de Piedra was the perfect place four our recent visit to Cuetzalen.  We were a party of 3 friends and I can't say enough to recommend it.  Very clean, quiet, good amenities including excellent breakfast.  The hotel is very well cared for and the staff is very helpful."
"wonderful rooms, a tad musty but air out well, super good location, quiet, super nice staff. our favourite in cuetzalan. they also have a good breakfast buffet on weekends and can get in-room massages."
…
Spectacular resort! Amazing staff! Ronald was very informative and helpful with accommodations and local scene. Rooms were always clean and staff was very friendly. I didn’t get the chance to book a massage however the gym was clean and up to date. Very relaxing environment to reconnect with yourself and your loved one.   Restaurant at the hotel was superb!
…
"Very beautiful place, charming atmosphere, I loved it from a first glance. Very helpful people working there, comfortable room. Easy to find and really next to the most popular points of interest in Bacalar…."
"We had a suite and enjoyed the call of the birds and the daily downpours.   The room was very nice, just a little dark and full of the sounds of the day.   What else can you expect in an old coffee warehouse in a Mexican town!"
es de los mejores hoteles en la zona lo recomiendo ampliamemte y a muy buen precio esta frente a la central de autobuses y en avenida principal aparte que cuenta con alberca y chapoteadero e incluye el desayuno que esta delicioso
"We can highly recommend Hotel & Suites Oasis in Bacalar. The location couldn’t be better, you can’t really be more central than this. We had our own wooden bungalow with its own porch, but there are also regular rooms if you prefer. Steven, the owner, and Luis the receptionist were both very friendly and full of great advice. We also received a very useful pdf brochure with tips on what to see and where to eat. Everything was walking distance from the hotel. After exploring the beautiful blue lagoon, we als"
"I loved everything about the Mia. The grounds are so peaceful, you could  only ear the wind and birds chirping through out the day. I loved the creative and unique architecture of the buildings. The bathrooms were my fave. I loved showering in what felt out doors because they have this cool indoor/outdoor feel with sticks and plants as your wall. ( If that makes any sense, it's hard to describe.) The lake is tranquil and one of my favorite moments was drinking beers while on the swings. They staff is kind a"
"It was my first rafting experience and I really enjoyed every minute of it! Some rapids are really challenging, specially if you go on rainy season, but Aventurec guides and staff are really helpful and experienced; they can tailor your rafting trip to suit your adrenaline needs. I never felt I was in danger. My only complaints are that they didn't take us to see the Pyramid, and they charge you extra money for the photos they take!"
"I can’t express how much I loved staying here! Location is perfect, Staff is amazing, the place is extremely spacious and sparkling clean. I’ve seen A LOT in Bacalar and by far this has been my favourite choice! Love it Love it Love it!!! 😁💯"
" way because it felt like our little quiet oasis. I cannot say enough good things. I cried when I left. Only negative and not the hotels fault is lots of mosquitos, so come prepared because they will start biting at check in,"
"Aventurec is located in the lush jungles of Veracruz. The company offers rafting trips, kayak rentals, guided services as well as shuttles. There are several options for kayaking in area. Everything from some of the steepest and extreme whitewater in the world to short class three river sections. There is a vast bird population, ancient ruins to explore and picturesque waterfalls. Aventurec offers a variety of lodging options and delicious food served on daily basis."

Adventurec offers shuttle services to some of the best rivers on the continent, with inexpensive lodgings, prime location, and wonderful staff. The rio alseseca is just a short drive away, go and play in some rapids and waterfalls.   Not a kayaker?   Not a problem. Adventurec is situated in a stunning natural environment, and hanging out there for a week is easy to do. Post up your hammock in the orange groves and enjoy th"
"I've been coming to Aventurec every year for last 4 years now and every time the hardest part is having to leave. the Reinoso's always take such good care of me, and las Chicas in the kitchen make delicious feasts every day. I highly recommend this place for any type of vacationer.   * hot tip * if you like sunsets go to the top of the Pyramid"
Our group of whitewater kayakers stayed here for several days.  It was a perfect location to launch our excursions and provided very comfortable accommodations as well as excellent meals.  (We had breakfast and dinner included.)  The staff is terrific and were very responsive and helpful.  We will definitely go back and highly recommend Adventurec to eco-tourists and adventure travelers.
"They have various options and will accommodate to your needs your trip. The staff is very helpful and most of them have been there for years. We took a one day package, without dinner and zipline (only my daughter did it as an option) We asked for the breakfast buffet ($130) which is delicious and plentiful We arrived 8:30am for breakfast buffet - recommended Wear your swim clothes, you will get wet, at the end you can change, you leave your things in your car. We departed past 9, with a walk down to the ri"
" take you back If you took a package with dinner and zipline (tirolesa) you can enjoy the pool, have a full dinner buffet and then go to the zipline If you took the shorter experience you can change and leave, only my daughter did the zipline as an option, and then we left. Bring or rent a towel ($20) for drying and changing at the end Look for their site because we had a bad service experience with another online reseller, Yoshi will answer all your questions and accommodate your needs."

My daughter and I stayed here when we went whitewater kayaking in the area.  There was a great sense of community and meals under the palapa were a treat.  The food was very good.  We had a cabin with a great porch overlooking a bushy ravine.  The only downside is they did not change the towels when they cleaned the room so we used the same towels for five days... but that's not too big a deal.  They turned off the ceiling fan every day but we wish they had left it on to dry our towels and clothes in the ro
The guides were knowledgeable and friendly. They helped my 60 year old mom who doesn't know how to swim feel secure and safe at all times. The initial cave we entered at the beginning of the trip with the waterfall was spectacular.
"This was a great play to stay for the weekend. The rooms were clean, the beds were very comfortable, and the buffet was delicious. The staff was friendly. The only thing I didn't like about the buffet was that the lady in charge of serving the food was sometimes not there, and there would be people waiting to be served."
"The hotel is clean, friendly and well priced, staff were welcoming and check inn was very easy, the choice of food on the menu was acceptable and the restaurant was open for service until 11.30. Swimming pool was clean and well maintained with clean towels available. Breakfast service was a little slow and if I had been there for business instead of leisure I would have been upset. WiFi speed was excellent. I will return"
"Lastima! , hotel bonito pero...me hospedé por dos noches y todo falló, la chapa nunca funcionó, no hubo agua en la segunda noche, el drenaje de la regadera no funciona bien, nos pidieron bañarnos en otra habitación, no había agua caliente, y no hubo compensación ni devolución de dinero, PESIMO servicio del retador encargado en recepción."
"El hotel nos gustó desde que llegamos. Su estilo arquitectónico y los colores son agradables a la vista. Las habitaciones son espaciosas y cuentan con aire acondicionado.  Son pocas habitaciones (alrededor de 30), y todas tienen vista a la piscina. El jacuzzi de la alberca es super cómodo y divertido. También cuenta con sevicio de internet y el WI FI no se cae, como en algunos otros lugares.  El restaurante, bello, pequeño y comida muy rica. Es muy limpio y agradable! ¡ME ENCANTO!"
"Si vas a Poza Rica no encontrarás un inmejorable Hotel  Limpio, confortable, con habitaciones al nivel de cualquier 5 estrellas, su alberca o Jacquzzi delicioso... y ni que decir de la comida que sirven en su restaurant Villa Magna, accesible, deliciosa y más"
Mi familia se hospedó en este hotel el Cual he visitado por el Sabor de su restaurante. Los visítamos por la noche  en su estancia en el hotel(habitaciones)  y quedamos maravillados . La atención del personal excelente . Sobre todo las Srita de área de limpieza las cuales andan limpiando a cada momento las áreas del Hotel para que este impecable . Mi familia quedo muy contenta . Los acabados de lujo en todos los detalles (créanlo) todos y con un precio accesible .  Y de noche luce espectacular !
"Nos quedamos en este hotel casi de improviso, y realmente fue muy buena nuestra estancia. El precio de la suite fue increíblemente satisfactorio ($986.00) y sobra decir que tanto los alimentos como la atención fue de primera. El hotel no es muy grande pero eso no tiene ninguna injerencia con nuestro descanso. La alberca con jacuzzi tiene su encanto, aunque el clima de este día no nos haya favorecido. Resumen: 100% recomendable. "
"Great place to sleep at night.  We liked the quietness and also having a good breakfast at the hotel before we left for a busy day.  We were in a hurry to get to a meeting at check-in, but with the staff´s help we were able to check-in very quickly and without any hassle."
"There are several chain hotels in the city, but this Fiesta Inn, besides being very comfortable has an amazing service from all staff. From the front desk to the restaurant, everyone is always making an effort to grant the best experience to guests. Rooms very comfortable."
"I confirm that my opinion about Fiesta Inn Poza Rica is because this Hotel has an excellent performance and facilities, I am going to recommend. In the future I will arrange my trips in this Hotel, I hope be there again."
"Great food, service and rooms as there are many hotels in the Poza Rica areaMany eating establishments in town but none were equal to the hotel especially the breakfast. I stayed a total of 12 days so I got to experience several restaurants.  Little weak on EnglishPricier than most in the area"
"Rooms are small, beds are quite comfortable. Swimming pool is small.Restaurant is good, average. The food is twice the price of anywhere else and half the portions, Internet is not working well, the staff is not so helpful."
"Stopped overnight while travelling.This was our second visit.Great price,service,clean and good food.There is ample parking with security.The rooms are spacious and clean.Internet provided.Bathroom was clean and big size.Beds are very comfortable.Complimentary coffee in room and small refrigerador."
"This is probably the oldest Fiesta Inn I ever stayed. From the outlook everything looks well kept, but the rooms are other story... really everything felt in bad shape.  I must say that service is reasonably good and the follow up the complains, but the is overshadow by the overall experience of spending the night in a very less comfortable place. Unfortunately, Poza Rica is a small city living a crisis so for sure there won't be any investments soon..."
"We stayed one night on our way back to Texas from the Yucatan Pennisula.Spacious rooms,very clean and comfortable bed and bathroom.Excellent internet.Staff very helpful and parking provided with security.We enjoyed the All you can eat breakfast buffet.Ws very reasonable price and quality.The price for the room was very low.Would return and stay if travels take me to this place again.You would not be disappointed at this hotl.Bed was awesome."
"On this stay I really feel very unhappy with the service of this hotel. I have frequented this hotel for 3 years and have never improved their quality in service of the restaurant, rooms and entertainment system television, in channels television only has the basic package offered or promoted by cable companies, this is a big company that offer their clients these ""fabulous and entertaining channels""; really is disconcerting."
"Hotel is nice for business trips. You can find the quite helpful staff, always ready to make your stay as comfortable as possible. It is close to shopping mall Soriana, walkable distance, where you can find cinema and other shopping stuff."
"We stayed with a group of friends at La Quinta Hotel in Poza Rica. We asked for a quiet room, away from any source of noise. The room they gave us was facing the noisy street in front and two floors above the karaoke bar. When I complained during the night to the front desk, all they told me was that ""there are guests that like to attend the bar"". So, if you want silence, ask for rooms away from the street and bar. The rooms and bathrooms are small. The food is average. The hotel presents itself as a four s"
"ok, the hotel is great, nice clean Quiet, the pool is amazing with a poolside bar and wonderful helpful personnel.   the buffet is adequate for a free option given your stay, scramble eggs and hotcakes with fruit and other breakfast essentials."
"is a good place to rest and eat, is very confortble the Hotel and the people is very servicial! the room is very nice, the food is very good, the bedroom is very good,  in general all the service is very good"
It's a quiet location . I love how clean it is . This is my second time and I will surely be back ! Staff is really attentive and polite . The breakfast is beyond what we serve in Belize . I  will definitely come back ! 
"The hotel is clean as are the rooms.  Service is good for the price range.  The hotel has a decent (though not huge) pool with a nice view; still, a nice way to cool off at the end of the day.  The food is OK but for Poza Rica I would expect it's on the higher end of what you can find nearby."
"I led a group of travelers from USA to the Poza Rica region of Veracruz in Mexico and really enjoyed our stay at the La Quinta!  I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and new the entire complex looked.  It was clean and safe with an amazing swimming pool.  The only reason I can't give it an ""excellent"" rating is because the breakfast was a tad too simple with only a few selections and very little changes each day.  The cable was also out for one whole day during our three-day stay.  One night we had some "
I traveled to Poza Rica with my family and found this place advertised as one of the top hotels in the area so we decided to give it a try. The place has a pool with a stunning view of the surrounding area. However we were disappointed with the quality of the food and drinks at the bar. The breakfast has the basics prepared with low quality ingredients. The Pina coladas were a glass of ice with no flavor or alcohol at all. And the last part of the first day was the air conditioner of our room. It worked wel
"Our 2nd stay here on route to/from US to Playa Del Carmen. Great place. Modern, clean, safe, comfortable, friendly, reasonable price. Great food. Great pool. Sits up on hill by itself across from Walmart, etc. very secure. Several other friends, travelers have used from our recommendation too. Locals use for weddings, etc.  Easy access from 180D toll road. Don't try to drive 180 Libre and through town to get there. Too much traffic that way. "
Very friendly and profesional staff. Especially Daniel from the front desk is very helpful. Nice outdoor pool overlooking the city of Poza Rica. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a stay......
"We were very please with the check in. We had made our reservation through orbitz just 20 min before getting there and it took 5 to 10 min to get into our rooms.  Convenient to the town, just across the street from a big mall.   The rooms are spacious and clean with a nice king bed. Offer in room coffee.  Child friendly since they have a play area in the courtyard and a nice large pool with a beautiful view. There is also a pool bar.  The four star for this hotel is because of the breakfast, it was mediocre"
Muy buena predisposición del personal El hotel Cómodo Céntrico Limpio Las peñas son lo más. A pocas cuadras en la Calle balcarce  Desayuno normal Limpieza ok Personal muy bueno Restaurante ok  Piletas y gym no probamos no tuvimos el tiempo Pero se Veía todo ok
"Las calles están llenas de gente y puestos de verduras. Hay muchas cantinas alrededor y eso para mí no da confianza. Ya no me hospedé porque el estacionamiento no tiene puerta. La recepción no está accesible, hay que subir escalones."
"Приятно, что первая пишу отзыв про этот отель!)) Были проездом в городе Поса Рика де Идальго. Остановились на ночь в отеле Casa Real, что бы с утра посетить El Tajin.  Отель расположен в центре. Небольшой. Есть своя бесплатная парковка. Для нас это был плюс, путешествовали на машине. Номер чистый, горячая вода есть, туалетные принадлежности тоже. Wi fi работал стабильно. В общем коридоре стоит кулер с питьевой водой. Кондиционер работал. Рядом с отелем на улице рынок. В отеле было тихо. Рекомендуем."
"El hotel no tiene elevador, ni clima en los pasillos. Pedí una habitación sencilla y me dieron una en tercer piso, con la pared descarapelandose y al parecer una persona la acababa de usar por que había una maleta ahí y el baño se veía acabado de usar. Pedí que me cambiaran de habitación y la encargada del hotel se porto amable, se disculpo y me cambio de habitación a una hab con cama king en primer piso. Lamentablemente las sábanas estaban sucias de polvo, pelos y había pequeños insectos. Las almohadas est"
" el reembolso de la habitación. Muchos clientes también pidieron que los cambiaran de habitación así que los encontraba en el pasillo cargando sus maletas de una habitación a otra. La recepción estaba muy desorganizada, no encontraban las llaves de las habitaciones, ni los controles de las televisiones o climas. Lo rescatable es la atención de la encargada de la recepción. No tienen agua caliente aunque dicen que si, las facturas del restaurante no las entregan a tiempo o las entregan con errores."
"Es un hotel pequeño pero muy cómodo, limpio y céntrico se encuentra en una Av.  Principal y frente al parque Juárez, caminando a pocas cuadras se encuentra un Italian Coffee,  el centro de la ciudad y un mercado."
"es increible visitar por segunda ocacion este hotel y es demasiado comodo, y lo mejor es la atencion de su persona, además eso esta muy bueno ya que te incluyen el desayuno.. se los recomiendo yo que vengo desde baja california."
"La chambre en angle, très lumineuse et bien équipée est agréable, elle donne sur une grande place, en lisière du centre ville très animé. Le petit déjeuner est simple et le parking privé à 30 mètres. Le personnel sympathique et très serviable."
"We booked this hotel last minute and were so impressed we extended the stay for 5 nights. The hotel is in a fantastic location, it’s spotlessly clean and the food is first class. We met the Director Fermin who speaks fantastic English, was so welcoming and clearly takes so much pride in his business. We were treated like family and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. We will be returning next year"
"All rooms, baths were clean. The Administrative employees are so kind, they are billingual. The free breakfast included was good. The transportation like Taxis was common in this location. The Hotel have not swiming pool."
The hotel is very neat and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are comfortable and quiet.  The parking lot has a lot of space and the breakfasts were OK at a reasonable price. The only downside was that the Wi-Fi wasn't working properly. 
"I stayed in Hotel Paris in October 2014 (my first time in Mexico, from Canada.)  The hotel is located at a prime intersection in Poza Rica (20 de Noviembre and Boulevard Ruiz Cortinez,) meaning that you will have easy access to good restaurants, all types of transportation, banks, shopping centres, cafes, and nightlife.    The hotel is well-kept, and well-decorated inside.  I stayed during the Day of the Dead, and the hotel was decorated with an altar, etc. which gives a taste of Mexican culture.  The hotel"
"I stayed here last week.  I drove a rental car 4 hours to this hotel so I could visit El Tajin the following day.  Being familiar with Best Western hotels in the US, I try to stay at these hotels when I travel to other countries since I know what to expect.  As a basic standard expectation for all hotels rooms, there is wifi in the room, hot water in the shower, cable tv, and climate control.  Most Best Westerns I have stayed at meet these standards at a bare minimum.  Finding this hotel was not easy, I had"
"This place is really the worst hotel we have ever been!! The so-called Manager and her staff were always trying to cheat on us since the very beginning. I guess that the good reviews on this cavern are from friends and relatives of the owners because it is really bad! Forget about service and quality, they just want your money!! Don't go!"
"This is a TERRIBLE place. We really advise you DON'T GO. The Hotel is not what the pictures show. Is old, not clean, but must of all,the staff there cheated on us since we made the reservation.   Once we were at the Hotel they did not missed  the occasion to fool us.  They charge us for breakfast when it was included, they charge different prices to the room rate and to the restaurant bill. When we claim at the time of paying the account,  the manager Wendy Loya  said  that they were going to  make a refund"
" centres.  The price includes an expansive breakfast buffet with a nice view of the street.  The food is excellent and authentic.  The hotel also has a cafe, and a bar up top.  There are friendly, bilingual staff who are very accommodating of guests' needs.  I needed to delay my checkout several hours, and the staff left me stay in my room during that time without any extra fee.  I would recommend asking for a room higher up and with a street view, as the view from the back of the hotel is not as pleasant. "
" to get by.  My room did not have a view, or windows you could see out of.  Regardless, I had a good night sleep, felt well rested in the morning, and the breakfast buffet was awesome.  They made me an omelet."
"Great place for business trip, but also for family, the rooms are really clean, and beds very comfortable. Although it is on a main street the rooms get very quiet. The pool is warm and clean, but not big, just enough to refresh and relax. The breakfast is outstanding! I'm sure I gained a couple of pounds. The staff were very nice. The best of all...pricing, you get a lot compared to what it cost."

"We went to this hotel for a quick weekend vacation to Poza Rica. It's a confortable hotel located in downtown poza Rica, which is a good choice if you want a good centric location at an affordable price"
"Hotel is centrally located at Av. Ruiz Cortinez and Av. 20 de Noviembre. If you are coming to Poza Rica for business trip this could be the best place to stay in the town.  Roof top dinning with bar makes the experience memorable in a city like Poza Rica. It has everything,which you can think. Rooms are pretty spacious and nicely maintained. It is worth to mention about the friendliness of the staff and their willingness to serve."
"Visitors must keep in mind that Poza Rica is not a wealthy town (in general), nor is it a tourist attraction.  It's a working town, a regular town, not too different from many rural industrial towns in my native Tennessee.  This hotel, in particular, is intended for business people (business MEN, in practice) who just want a basic place to stay.   I've visited this hotel twice. The first time, we stayed in a basic room.  It was clean, but as other reviewers noted, the bathrooms in particular were past their"
Stayed just one night at this hotel on a self drive tour around Norway.  The location is great and we had a great view of the ski jump.  Everything is within walking distance.  Our room was small but was good compared some of the other places we stayed in.  Best breakfast on our trip!
"Excelent hotel, good location and great service. Great buffet,and excelent bar, is out of the way, very handy location, and in interesting suburban area, change from usual tourist bustle. Rooms very spacious, facilities great. Service very good, helpful, free connection with wlan. Very good transport service. And vg value."
" back home.  The suite itself is all stone; perfect for my allergies.   Large double-paned windows with great natural light, and good air conditioning (a bit loud, but it drowns out the street noise.) Bathroom was in good shape.  Best of all, the owner has substantially improved the internet.  The internet is ""good enough"" now.  Streaming videos may freeze occasionally, but no issues with email, social media, etc. during our week-long stay. I like the restaurant, too.  The Veracruz-style dishes were good, a"
"We planned to visit El Tajin and thought the Hotel Victoria looked pleasant enough.  It was the 1st of January so we didn't think there would be a problem getting a room.  We were charged rack rate of what comes to about $95.00 US dollars a night.  The young lady behind the desk spoke with a mumble, we could barely understand anything she said (we are both level 2 speakers).  The room was comfortable but certainly not worth the price.  It had new furniture but old carpet and drapery.  The plumbing facilitie"

 getting ready to take off! There were so few people there we could not understand why she didn't space the few of us out.  The walls are so thin you could hear the man next door clearing his sinus cavities.  They added insult to injury when we saw the sign on the normally complimentary bottle of water left in the room.  See the attached photo. It is not worth your money and there are at least 4 other hotels on the same street.  They are far from the only game in town.  Pozo Rico is a typical oil refinery t
"Pros: Clean, close to markets, pharmacy, coffee shop. Clean room. Hot water. Coffee pot and coffee in room. Didn't eat in restaurant, but had ice cold beer. Waiter was not interested in providing anything better than the minimal service.   Cons: Very, very old. Small A/C unit could not cool the room (not even in April). Very small showers. Internet won't connect on 3rd floor. Traffic noise. Broken toilet seat. Difficult to get more than one coffee pack. Exercise room is just OK for cardio. Crappy Kmart weig"
"When you arrive, seems good, but the room is very small, the shower rusty. But the worst parts comes when you go to the restaurant (Fajita de Oro), they take 10 minutes to take your order, and if you like to give your money for free, I check my card notifications and charge me twice one meal, in that restauran they hardly ask you if you need something else. Try to avoid it"
"The hotel is next to the road to Papantla village, this save you some time if you wanna go to visit this small town. The hotel is clean and it has a huge space to walk in among the gardens. The pool is small."
"Loved my time there! Fransisco and the team made it such a good stay. The place was serviced daily and kept really clean, plus when I was looking for something all the staff were so helpful!! Will come back for sure"
"I spent 1 night here , its the nearest town to the impressive site of El Tajin. Clean room , plenty of hot water & air conditioning. I had an evening meal & breakfast both good. Situated on the outskirts of Poza Rica which is an industrial city. If you want a convienent overnight base I would recommend this hotel."
"**TRAVELLER BEWARE ** This hotel is not as advertised. The only “toiletries” provided was an old hand soap bottle that had been refilled, with.. hand soap? Shampoo? Nope, I think it was dish soap. There was no security safe, the furniture in the room is broken and the mirror wasn’t even on the wall.  There is no ventilation in the room, so the mildew smell is strong. We were contemplating sleeping on the lawn chairs by the pool while we waited for responses from booking.com.  If you love ants, this place is"
"I spent there just a couple of nights. Went to celebrate Mexico's Independence Day with my girlfriend and I've to say I had a great time not just because of the music and food but the hotel room was quite comfortable. A/C, minibar, satTV... breakfast next day good enough to start the day. Totally recommend it."
"Stay away! The pics on Booking.com are nicely taken and lets the hotel look good! But really far from, you will be very disappointed when you reach. There is already the first and second bad surprise, the location outside of Sayulita, on a dirt road, next to a big loud road, where many trucks pass. You have to walk dark streets to town. Then  at Check in they  ask u FULL cash payment in Pesos. And they rip you already off with the exchange rate, the rate on booking.com was 860$ for 6 nights (way overpriced "
"If you ever venture in this interesting town in the Vera Cruz area, this will be the place to stay. This hotel feels safe and it is well maintained. It looks like a decent resort with a nice pool and a great spa. Very affordable services. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and well taken care of. The public spaces are well maintained. The food is decent and the restaurant is open late. The service is pretty good and all people are nice. You have the feeling that you are in an chain hotel, yet this is a bou"
" lining the walkway to the room, there were  used Q-tips.   This was our honeymoon, and I regret booking at this hotel, it cost us more money, because we had to book an Airbnb for the days we had booked in this hole. We have asked for our money back, and they are taking their sweet time. I don’t want anyone else to go through what we went through in a foreign country where you feel alone.  "
" invoice all of a sudden its 21 Pesos for 1 USD? So we ended up paying with a normal MasterCard and were charged 934 USD. That already gave a us bitter taste. The other payment options are bank transfer and some mexican things, tourists can not easily do. The place is at the end of Sayulita, outside the village, you need to walk about 20 minutes to reach village center. Very bad neighbourhood, on a dirt road and NO internet in the rooms. We needed to sit on the stairs to catch some Internet from the office."
"I travel often to Poza Rica for work. This hotel is always full or too expensive to consider. But this last time the price that I found online was a bit high (1,180.00mxn) but OK.  So I decided to stay and pamper myself since it was only for one night.  It turns out that it simply is a huge place with OK service. Nothing special. They don't even include breakfast and the air conditioner in the room is way too loud. I couldn't even listen to the TV even if it was turned all the way up. I'm sure my neighbors "

"Me encanto este hotel, fueron muy amables y atentos, los precios del hotel son muy económicos. El hotel tiene un canta bar, te la pasas muy bien, también tiene un restaurante, donde se come rico. Lo recomiendo."
"I stayed for 7 days this month, innovative use of shipping containers which are the rooms, around a pool. Simple, but have everything you need and very comfortable, modern, AC, and a short 3 minute walk to town on level street (not up and down a big hill). Right next to the bus station, and tucked off the street so very quiet, you don't actually see it from the street, it's behind the health center."

"We were traveling through Mexico on a four month expedition with Central America Overland Expeditions. We had recently visited El Tijan Ruins and were looking for a place to park the trucks, like a camping spot or trailer park. However we were pleasantly surprised that this four star hotel had a parking area where we could park our trucks and use all of the facility for only $20.00 a night. We had a great time and were treated very nice, even though we had our dirty expedition trucks parked and camping like"
"Room designs on upper floors are worth 50% more than the going price. Pool is cold but inviting. And of course views spectacular. Far superior to nois, salty oceanfront. Managers' English is excellent."
We stayed in the Esmeralda for two nights.  My son had lived in this part of Mexico for 2 years and wanted to show the family around.  We always travel on a tight budget so we don't expect much but I have never stayed in a place as bad as this before.  We got a room with 3 double beds that cost $80 US per night.  The loby was nice but when we got to the room it was not clean.  The plumbing in the bathroom backed up and there was a terrible sewer smell in the bathroom.  The pipes go directly to the sewer so

Open space lobby which can be hot in summer.  They have a nice pool.  Entrance is green and nice.  They have a good big room for parties.  Restaurant is average.  Service is average.  Rooms are not very comfortable with kind of old furniture.
"We were there in late January, not the busiest time of year and got a good rate for the room.  We were on the top floor in a two bedroom and two bathroom suite with a good kitchen and large, open air sitting area.  Almost palatial.  The bedrooms had roomy balconys as did the sitting area.  There is couple of propane BBQs and a charcoal one as well on the pool deck and lots of poolside furniture.  It is not a large hotel, no more than twenty rooms.  When we got there the pool was cloudy and greenish but they"
"It's a nice property located in a small hill.  My first impression is that it had a magnificent past, and an incomplete renovation. Rooms are spacious in separate 2 story buildings. Has a nice pool with a business bar that is the highlite of the property.  I may choose a newer hotel next time."

"Estuve en este hotel y no se los recomiendo, ya que no cuenta con todos los servicios que nos ofrecen, mas sin embargo los precios son sumamente carisimos y sus hab, son de lo peor, una señora de tes blanca nos hizo cambiar de hab como 3 veces, la causa fue porque las hab estaban apartadas. Eso a nosotros como huespedes no nos importa por eso pagamos. Jamas volveremos a ese lugar horrible"
"I was in Poza Rica on business and pick this hotel based on its proximity to the office.  However, it was about a close to a resort as you will find in Poza Rica.  No beach, but a nice pool with a bar.  The resturant was very good for breakfast and true Mexican food (so so for ""Canadian"" food).  The staff was helpful (trying to teach me some new Spanish words).  The one downside was that it isn't within walking distance of anything.  So you need to have a car or take taxis."

"We stayed during the Mayday holiday.  We seemed to be the only non Spanish speaking guests.  Everyone we encountered, staff and guests, greeted us very cordially.  Our room our room opened right onto the pool.  Several families were enjoying the pool but they always quit at 10:00 every night.  We did not encounter any of the problems mentioned in other reviews.  We had a very enjoyable and look forward to returning. As a added bonus, the trees around the hotel are filled with iguanas that are interesting to"
"If I could give this place a zero, I would. It was my birthday weekend in Sayulita and the town was very full. I booked a room here and pre-paid for it. When we showed up, they actually modified my reservation for me (as if I did it) on booking.com for the following night (we were not even in town this night.) They were full and sold my room to someone else paying cash. They altered my reservation because they didn’t want to get in trouble with booking.com and told me “sorry you booked for the wrong night”."
"Acabo de llamar al establecimiento para pedir información sobre el hospedaje y tarifas. Me contestó una persona bastante negligente quien después de preguntarme de donde soy y decirle que de Ciudad Juárez y que viajo sola me negó el hospedaje alegando e están saturados.

The room was everything we saw in the pictures so no disappointments.  Beautiful pool & great place to just hang out & meet other people staying here.  We loved the area as it was peaceful & quite, unlike staying in the down town area near the square & for that reason did not mind the 10 minute walk to the beach.  Checked out the 2 bedroom suite before we left & loved it so m"
" apartment owner in Sayulita. It basically ruined our night because everything by then was sold out, so it took us another two hours to find a place to stay. I have never in my life experienced such terrible customer service and I have traveled a lot. Such bad business etiquette. This type of behavior should never happen by a reputable business. Save yourself trouble and book elsewhere. Dishonest people and very rude. "
"Cheap, clean and basic. Seems to be in the process of renovating, the upper floor is modern and we had a nice bathroom. Some rooms have fans and others air-con, we were offered both but decided we could cope with only a fan. It was crazy hot the days we visited so I'd recommend the rooms with air-con if you visit in spring/summer. 15 minutes walk to the zocalo and less to the bus station.

"Its location is a short walk uphill from the zocalo.The room is not bad for the price , its clean and quiet. Its close to the ado busstation. It doesnt look like a hotel, but more like a private guesthouse."
"I went to Poza Rica to give a talk in a congress. The city is pretty ugly, oil centered and badly planned, but the natural and hystoric surroundings are wothwhile. Food in Veracruz is exquisite! Very warm! Bring shorts ans polos, don´t forget a hat and sunglasses."
"A very nice and minimalistic hotel close to the beach AND still being quiet enough to relax and breathe and take a nice vacation, the A/C was very good and the reception was always available. The hotel's pool is very pretty and intimate for decompressing, Looking forward to visit again!"
"Minimalist boutique hotel with great location to the beach. We enjoyed our stay in room 2, although there was no window, the room was cozy. Loved the shower and the bed was very comfortable. Would liked to have had a coffee in the morning without leaving to pick one up. Very well maintained and manicured grounds. Loved the pool and lounge chairs. Natalia was a great hostess! Would stay again, but would want a room with a window."
"Good location (Av. Del Palmar) very easy to find. There is nothing to complain about staff and rooms. Staff is friendly, kind and very helpfull. When you'll arrive they let you know everything... and even more👍.  We got AC + Fan groundfloor room, Wi-Fi. Room was big enough, clean and comfortable. Roomcleaning every day. Hotel is unique and atmosphere is peacefull. Design is very inspiring and just awesome.  Special thx to manager/owner? - Premium class service and attitude👍 Absolutely worth for the money, I"
"We booked here because of numerous good reviews. We left after 2 nights and that was one night earlier than our initial booking. There are some good features to the hotel. It is centrally located in Salulita and a very good restaurant (La Rustica) is only a .2 mile walk away. The beach is even closer. The room came with a good kitchen area and deck, and was clean, except for an influx of very small ants on the bathroom counter, which just kept coming. The big bed was very comfortable. The young front desk a"
" operated by a lovely young Canadian lady). The less good but ok bits of the hotel included that if you wanted to change the air conditioner temp, you had to run downstairs and get the desk clerk to do it, the Wifi was only moderately reliable, and if you wanted sun by the pool, you would have to drag one of their deck chairs away from a wall which provided only shade and then around a very poorly designed pool area with a twisty pathway right over to the other side of the pool where there was not much room"

"I thought this was perfect just outside downtown and quiet.  Plenty of space, nice little balcony just outside your room.  Clean and close to everything.We got a great price at the time, highly recommend."
"The staff was very friendly when receiving us after a long day of travel. They checked us in quickly and showed us our room (which was the no view, no balcony). It had a microwave, fridge, pots/pans, and plates/bowls/silverware/cups in the kitchenette area. The room and bathroom were cleaned and housekeeping came daily. The room included a plasma tv with cable, wall A/C unit, and overhead fan. Storage includes some end tables and double door in-the-wall shelving for storage. There is a safe in the storage a"
" smelled cigarette smoke on occasion. We never shut the small top windows which may have solved that problem. The room was cooler than most since it didn't get the sunshine heat all the day long. The area is very safe, and they close the front gates into the garden area after a certain time at night for added security.  The gardens were very well kept and clean as was the pool. It was not heated, but the temperature was comfortable to escape from the heat of the day. The staff spoke English and Spanish. The"

My friend and I enjoyed very much our stay at Los Encantos.  It is more in the Mexican part of town and yet a five minute walk to the hub of Sayulita. We awoke each morning to the cockerels crowing away and a few dogs barking and felt we were more in the country.  (I actually missed the sounds this morning after returning home yesterday!) This is a new hotel and everything in excellent shape.  There is WiFi in the rooms and we only lost it once. The gardens are very nice indeed and well kept.  Also parking 
"Great people running this place.  Had issues with my flight and they were right there with me helping right till 1:00AM in the morning.  Then again first thing in the morning helping with my transport. What can you say when people care but thank you! Perfect rooms for the price as well, with a small deck to relax and have a cock tail just before a nap!"
"Very good!  Awesome People! Good and beautiful swimming pool! Very good location, just a few steps to the main street! Sometimes we had no electricity and the WiFi were terrible on the room, but I would go back tô this hotel for sure! "
The photos make it look like a boutique hotel as do some of the descriptions. But this is a hostel with a few shared bathrooms for a lot of rooms. Our room was tiny with a double bed. The check in staff were doing their best with the 3pm influx of check ins.
"Ive been doing Selina's CoLive package. Overall Selina is a high end hostel that allows digital tomads to travel, meet people and try out different things. This Selina was very disappointing.  1. Music all the time. If you are a digital nomad you will not get much sleep. 2.CoWork fits around 8 people, nd no COVID restrictions in place. No one wears a mask nor there are temperature checks. 3. Sayulita beach is among the most contaminated in Mexico. Very dirty. 4. Overall I'd recommend any other beach in MX."
Bad experience.  They overcharged you for extra guest and they don’t have the beds to accommodate what you paid for .  The room it is dirty and it is not a king size bed they said.  Also they overbook and they are selling rooms in different websites do you are stuck with what ever is available even if doesn’t not accommodate all your guest.
"We arrived at 3pm, the staff/check in all seemed a bit confusing, after a little bit of back and forth/trying to log in and check in on my phone they eventually told us that our room was not ready and we could wait by the pool. We waited for about 40 minutes for our room to get cleaned. I had to approach them to get the key and they pointed to our room - forget help with our bags or any sort of greeting. We had Room 104 which is right next to the check in desk, right next to the entrance and right next to t"
" tomorrow they could help us. We never heard from them again, they never checked on us, greeted us...nothing. I read some decent reviews of this place and was expecting a little more for $100/night. I would suggest staying somewhere else, somewhere with a nice staff that cares about their guests, somewhere that doesn’t have a club next door blaring music until 2am, unless that’s your thing."
"The roof was leaking, there were stains on sheets, hair on the pillows and the whole place was disgusting. There is no reception area and no one speaks English or picks up the phone. Had to leave and look for a last minute booking. The hotel refused a refund as their policy with regards to “my issue” is to deny."
"I had a wonderful experience when visiting Papelillo Lofts, the spaces are very generous, the location is unbeatable right in the center of Sayulita. You can have the windows fully open to let the sunlight wake you up in the morning or leave them with blackout curtains to rest. We had a full kitchen and air conditioning in all rooms. The impressive thing about this place is the urban architecture mixed with the colorful touch that characterizes the town of Sayulita. There were no problems getting to the bea"

 unique experience that I would gladly repeat.

"We came to Sayulita from Puerto Vallarta only intending to stay a day.  While there, we were so in love with this location that we decided to stay the night and another full day.   This was the first hotel we came across, so we inquired.  For the small price and the charming feel, we couldn't resist.  We stayed in Room 2, just pushed back a bit from the main entrance.  We were just steps away from the local Farmacia where we were able to purchase toothbrushes and other necessities.  Even though EVERYTHING i"
" the linens were very clean.  Complimentary Wifi for guests is a nice perk, and at night for security , there is a wooden door at the entrance that your room key will allow entry back to the property, I seen this as an added plus.  The property appears to be very well maintained, and pleasant."
…
"Bungalow's Jaqueline is a great local, relatively quiet, (depending on room) Sweet place. You can request a room more towards the back part of the hotel, by the pool, if you desire.The rooms are adequate,, clean and they care about their guests. It is less than a block from the mainroad, and night security seems solid.The places comes  with Frig's and a kitchnette area. Comfy and well priced. Also check out my place, Casa Cocoon! (Saylita)"
"I really like this place! For me I like green lush foliage. So when I saw this place I was sold. The rooms are quaint, the location is super central. Only a block-and-a-half from the beach and basically in the core of the town. This place is like a little sanctuary. The pool is beautiful and surrounded by plants. The place is really quiet and clean.   The only fault this place has is that this whole town is pretty noisy. I always bring earplugs wherever I travel so I had no problem sleeping. If I got a room"
"We stay here for several nights at least once a year and love the location, pool, well appointed bungalows and softer beds.  Staff is friendly, place is secure and clean. Price is good for what you get. Can't wait to come back!"
"Found this amazing place by accident, and so glad we did! We were at an absolute dive several doors down, wanted to stay another night, but not where we were. As we walked past this place, they had an availability and voila...one of the best stays in our entire Mexico trip. Simple but elegant decor, private little pool in the back, friendly staff.  Will be booking here next year, and the next, and the next...."
"I was staying across the street at a place that was not as comfortable as advertised. I visited Bungalow's Jacqueline and instantly was at peace with its inviting allure. Claudia (front desk manager) was a beautiful soul.. Very good service... big loving smile. My room was cleaned every day, Sheets changed.. Pool was refreshing.. Simple, comfortable place to stay at. Definitely worth every penny."
"We drove out to Sayulita for a look around and found this gem, could not resist renting the bungalow for a night. It was beautiful, very comfortable and secure. they have a private parking area for the guests, which was a requirement because we did not want to leave the rental car parked on the street.  This is a few easy steps from everything in Sayulita and close walk to the beach. We will definitely come back when we have more time to hang out longer."
While I cannot speak for all of the rooms please beware of room 6.  There is a bar next to this hotel with very poor karaoke patrons and the noise and smoke from the bar may be challenging for you to get a good nights sleep.  Maybe try back by the pool??? Sayulita is a bit expensive compared to other Mexican towns as it is a resort town so you may find this hotel is on the expensive side.  It certainly was from my experience and as mentioned it was not a good stay for us.
"My husband and I had an amazing stay at Distrito 88 hotel. The property is small, charming, and has a youthful vibe. We stayed in suite 4, which had an amazing view of Playa Sayulita. The staff is very friendly (shoutout to Lalo for going out of his way to make our stay memorable), and they made an amazing breakfast and great cocktails. The location is excellent being close enough to easily walk to all the shops and restaurants downtown but high enough on the hill to still be quiet and peaceful. The pools w"
"One of the best places I’ve stayed at. Has a beautiful view from our room. Nice pool, the room was super clean and very nice. Feels very safe to stay, and the town is amazing. It’s a very short distance to walk to beach, and their service is excellent. Would definitely come back and stay even longer !"
"My sister and I stayed here for almost a week during August and we LOVED it. It's in a quieter area of Sayulita but still really walking distance to both the beach and city. The property manager, Lalo, is truly amazing. He would always answer promptly to our questions and when there was another room nearby that was being really loud at night he followed up on it and took care of it for us. There's 3 pools that are all gorgeously designed to be picture perfect and it also is plenty of space for just the 8 su"
"We stayed in Suite 7 and it was great for what we needed. The pool with lounge chairs right outside the room (sun for half the day, shade for half which was perfect with the heat), lounge chairs upstairs with full sun and umbrellas to use as needed, and the kitchen right next door. I had chilaquiles for breakfast every morning and they were honestly AMAZING. My partner had pancakes one morning and they were also really good (props to the chef, she’s LEGIT!). The staff working in the kitchen area and through"
" under 60 minutes and were more of a rub down than massages. I’m pretty particular about massages (I like deep pressure, not just open palm strokes) so I was disappointed with the massage we received at the hotel. Although the women were very kind (and maybe other people enjoy this type of massage?), I felt we had been taken advantage of a little bit in regards to the price.  We ended up walking to Nirvanna in town and got 80 minute sport massages for $50USD/person and they were SO GOOD.  Overall, the room "

"I stayed there a couple days ago. We booked 2 days and made plans to leave, shortly after we arrived and smelled sewage all around the grounds.  This is NOT a new place? This is an old run down house that has ants and very steep access.  This is NOT  what they discribe!  And, of course they will NOT refund me for the day I didnt stay there but it was worth it to get away from the seawge smell that pereated the area..."
"We enjoyed our stay at Distrito 88. Lalo is an excellent communicator and host who ensured that we were well received upon arrival late in the evening.  The property is located high on a hill with an ocean view, a few minutes walk from the heart of the action in Sayulita. Our room was cute and clean and we were able to access Netflix/Amazon on the TV.  We will certainly stay here again when we return to Sayulita."
"Travelling during covid is stressful, but distrito88 was the best escape from everything!! Eduardo was amazing! He reached out to us as soon as we landed and helped us with directions to the hotel. He gave us so many great recommendations about the town and things to do, and could literally set up anything we wanted, tours, golf cart, massages at the hotel. He was literally the best!!! The hotel was SO clean and beautiful! The staff was amazing! The breakfast and coffee in the morning was awesome! We had th"
"We loved it here!!! My husband and I, a couple in our late 30s/early 40s stayed here for 6 days mid November and would definitely come back again. The views are amazing!!! We stayed in suite 3 on the top floor and really enjoyed our balcony to have coffee in the morning and drinks in the evening. The room was beautiful and had everything we needed, the AC worked really well and the water pressure in the massive shower was great. The town is super close and there is a nice shaded path you can walk down (it i"
" This is a lovely little hotel on the outskirts of busy Sayulita. It’s on a hill so a bit of a climb. We rented a golf cart so it was great. The pool was small but not many people stuck around during the day anyway. Two more lounge chairs would be nice for another couple to use at the same time.   There’s not much difference from a studio and a suite. The studio balcony’s are in direct sun , the suite’s in shade. Studio has a one door mini fridge with a small freezer inside. The suite had one with a separat"
 breakfast delivery from a nearby restaurant. We never tried the delivery but the breakfast sandwiches from the North Side cafe were incredible ! We either went there or my husband brought it back. It’s close by.   The coffee in your room was really good! A small two cup coffee maker but you get  a little container of coffee refilled every day. They have sugar and coffee mate packages. We bought our own cream from the Mega store.   The beach is close and not nearly as busy as the one in town. They provide b

This hotel was perfect for our needs.  Its very close to the beach and an easy walk when you compare it to some of the other places on the north end of town that are very high up on the hill.  The walk into the town centre is about 10 minutes but there are amenities very close by.   Ours was a 1 bed studio suite and was very clean with a functionable kitchen (just could of used a larger coffee maker).  The wifi worked well for the most part.  The view from the roof-top sitting area was beautiful.  We did no
" her an email stating your estimated time of arrival.  We loved all the birds that we can see and hear from our deck.  The hotel is in a quiet location, away from the noise of the down-town area.  The roosters where doing a good job of waking us at 4:00am so make sure to bring ear plugs!  All in all a great stay and will return."
…
"A little disappointed in the pool as one day “not enough water”, then when I did get in(one time in 8 days) it was one depth not conducive to non swimmers or children. The jacuzzi was nice when cool and no obvious controls for heat or jets! The breakfast was never served and at end of trip found out there was “no cook”! The beach chairs were in sad shape as were the towels and when we wanted to exchange no one was about! The kitchenette was sufficient, and we loved our balcony for breakfast. The sitting are"
"Never being to Sayulita previously, we didn't know where to stay and took a chance here and we're almost 100% glad we did. The folks working here were VERY friendly and helpful. The room we had was very clean and decorated very nicely. Our view from our room was very nice with morning ""wake up"" sounds of birds. Now the bad news - the wifi was terrible. I needed to do some important searching was found it very difficult."
We stayed in the 2-br 2-ba Casa at Mar y Suenos. Very clean and spacious. Fully equipped kitchen. Two lovely outdoor sitting areas. Located close to many restaurants and stores. Beach is very close. Be sure to take an umbrella from the front desk before you go. We used the pool but not the jacuzzi during our stay. A friendly cat came to visit daily too. Would definitely stay here again. 
"A great place to stay in Sayulito, Mexico. North side of town, very private, great view. Staff were most helpful & had great English. A very short walk to many restaurants and shops. Rooms very clean & well appointed.. Will stay here again when we come back."
"Did a lot of research on this property and was a bit skeptical given the limited number of reviews, but I ended up booking a reservation on the hotel website. I received a confirmation number on screen, but when I later entered the number to view my reservation it said there was no reservation under that number. I reached out to the email address on their website and have yet to hear from them after 2.5 days. Not sure if they’re still operating."
"I loved the views, you can see the sea from almost everywhere. The service was great and the bed really comfy. I liked very much the concept of using containers to build the hotel. Near the sea and the main streets. (-:"
"Great decoration, amazing and comfortable bed and pillows, unique terrace, complete kitchen. Basically, everything you need for a great stay at Sayulita. Stephanie, the manager is lovely and always attentive to your needs.  If had to criticize something, it would be the apartments don't have that much daylight, but that's not an issue as you spend all day at the beach, and then get to chill out at the amazing terrace each apartment has."
"The place isn't fancy and you're not paying much. Its basic but has all the necessities: good AC, decent wifi (I streamed directv on my laptop) and even has a little kitchenette. There is no reception. I made a reservation on hotels.com and received a message with a phone number to call. Luckily my phone works in Mexico. It was a bit tough to get through but when I finally did I arranged to meet someone at 3pm for checkin (they spoke decent english). When I arrived (using google maps) someone was waiting fo"

"Para empezar, el lugar NO es un hotel. Es un tipo de airbnb, se comparte un living y balcón  entre 2 habitaciones privadas. La ubicacion es alejada del centro y calle de acceso es muy fea, pasando por una zona precaria  con animales. Esto me tomo por sorpresa al llegar, dado que por la pagina de reservacion lo venden como un hotel. Tenia 3 noches ya pagas previamente, pero al día siguiente me termine yendo del lugar. Nunca me devolvieron el dinero ni se hicieron cargo de mi reclamo. No recomiendo este lugar"
"Ficamos por dois dias no hotel e ficamos muito felizes com a limpeza e o conforto do quarto. Tudo é bem novo, parecia que éramos uns dos primeiros a utilizar o quarto, a cama era muito confortável e de fato era uma king size, ficamos impressionados com o tamanho da cama. Rey, o recepcionista, é muito gentil e solícito e se dispoe a ajudar pelo wpp a qualquer hora. O único lado negativo é que a pousada fica em um morro que não é fácil de subir com as malas, pagamos um taxi por 60 pesos pra nos levar até lá. "
"Mi Otra Casa was a DREAM to stay in. Me and my 16 friends were able to stay in this gorgeous home for my 30th birthday trip to Sayulita.   The house is right in the middle of all the action - 2 minute walk to bars, taco stands, shops, and the main square. The house is also 3 blocks from the ocean. You can’t beat the location!   The concierge service was outstanding. Edward, who owns the home, can coordinate anything from on-site COVID tests, excursions, and even an at home chef which we ended up taking adva"

It's in the heart of town, across from the bustling little plaza, and close to everything you might need. My boys loved the easy access to surfing during the day, and the night life options at night. I loved how quaint and well manicured the property was, and how helpful the staff and owners were. For e"
" everything was already booked during the Christmas week. My only suggestion would be to figure out how to improve the WIFI service. It was available around the grounds and pool area, but it was impossible to get any service inside our rooms (we were in El Pajaro - Suite 20). Never the less, I can't wait to come back here again!"
…
We lucked into finding this gem on Airbnb. Sayulita is pretty and the downtown square is always bustling. This hotel is behind tall walls and inside is an oasis. Everything is super clean and we'll maintained. The owners and staff and incredibly friendly and helpful but never intrusive. The location is just perfect. 
We had a wonderful time again at Hotel Vogue.  Many thanks to Mary and Marvin for making us comfortable.  There are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. There were renovations being done while we where there but the work didn't start until after we were up for the day. We continue to come back to this Hotel.  See you next year!!!
"Lovely place. Great staff. Lovely grounds. Rooms are well appointed - AC works great, etc. Right on the main square but the rooms are set back, so pretty isolated from noise. The rooms are a bit cozy but you should be outside anyway. ;)"
"We have nothing bad to say about this vacation at the Hotel Vogue.  Well one, but that's not their fault: we lost our zip drive to the zip line trip we took and the company has been unable to locate our photos.  We can't seem to find the contact for the right company.  Hotel Vogue is perfectly located about a half mile to the beach.  Clean, plenty of room for a couple, spacious patio, quiet, comfortable room with fridge and basics for kitchen.   It isn't fancy but it isn't drab or specifically ""un-fancy"" if"
" Quick easy walk to the beach and they are happy to set you up with an umbrella and chairs or you can pay about $6 to sit in front of a beach restaurant who will wait on you all day long.  If you want a low-key yet truly beautiful vacation, Sayulita and Hotel Vogue are for you.  It is clearly being developed quickly so get there soon because not having giant hotels around is part of its charm.  We are planning to return next year!"

Great hotel. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was recently built so everything is new. Was very happy with the TV and Internet options. I was able to watch the game in English and the kids had cartoons in English as well. I also had fast WiFi and was able to get some work done remotely. Both are rarities in this area so I was very pleased. Lots of restaurants are close by and only a few blocks from the beach. Very pleased.
"This is my favorite place to stay in Sayulita! Amazing rooftop pool and bar, great service, soo close to the beach and everything in town, clean, and friendly staff. They even provided us with boards for surfing. 10/10 would recommend."
"Fantastic option, hotel is new, rooms are spacious, trendy decor, great service and the location is unbeatable! I came for a couple of nights with my teen boys and we absolutely had a blast. 2 minutes to the beach. Restaurants are all over. The pool on the roof is a great option to unwind after a beach day.  They have a bar,  ping pong table and awesome music. We will return for sure!"
"I very much dislike the way this hotel is run. In fact, it ruins the experience so much that I am writing my first TA review!The staff follow a set of restrictive rules - even when my room smelled of absolute sewage (room 120), they had to send a maintenance person twice to confirm “my story” rather than just moving me. My friends room (121) also eventually smelled of manure so it might be indicative of a broader structural problem. Anyway, they don’t allow guests into the hotel. They force you to wear an o"

Bedding is limited, and had to ask for extra blankets, and was able to be given 1 extra.  we had to purchase a blanket at a vendor.

"We booked the ""Penthouse"". The penthouse is NOT private. The staff laundry and the other ""Penthouse"" suite are separated by thin doors with light and noise all night. It took us an hour to find anyone to even check in the first night after a day of travel. The ""private deck"", is actually a common area for staff, and guests to peak into your room. Some staff will allow you to invite friends over, and some will NOT. We found that out, when our friends came over to change and use our bathroom at 1pm. They were"

For your kitchen, you get two glasses, and a small bowl for cooking. 50% of the lights work, with some exposed wiring For the beds, you get 1 paper thin sheet each. When we asked for two thicker blankets, they said they could only find one, which was for a twin size bed. The patio curtains looked like they had blood splatter on them. The view was epic. The housekeeping staff were the only accommodating and friendly people on site."

The sheets didn't fit the king sized bed so it felt like we were sleeping in a short-sheeted bed.   The issue that kind of capped of our stay is that the pool for the unit above is right over the patio, "

We booked a 2 bd apartment over Christmas week months in advance through booking.com. The issues started when we could not find the place - booking.com does not give you the correct address nor do they tell you the apt is part of the “Pajara de Fuego” condo complex. We found out from our travel guide later in the trip that this could be because booking.com wants to hide the fact that this condo complex had a balcony collapse with an entire family on it due to poorly construction a few years back (have not c
" ever again after that). We finally find the property and there is no management or anyone working the front gate or office at 3:30pm.  We arrive at the room at about 4pm (3 hours after check in) to find that the maids had just begun cleaning it. It’s completely trashed and we can see dirty dishes everywhere, plates of food, etc… they tell us that the “room won’t be ready for another 2 hours when they’re done cleaning it.” I continue to try and call the management but no one answers.   We wait two hours out"

Completely happy with our stay at Pajaro de Fuego bungalows. Our bungalow was perfect for my family of 5. Drive to town was less than 10 minutes. No noise whatsoever at night which was perfect after a long day. My three boys enjoyed the warm/heated pool. Beautiful place!!!
"My family of 7 stayed at #202 at Pajaro de Fuego in June 2021 to attend a wedding at a nearby property.  This unit has 3 bedrooms, and 3 bathrooms.  The unit is very clean, AC is available throughout the unit and is very cold, this helped us cool off quickly as we returned from the beach.  The unit has 2 levels, 2nd floor bedroom has a large bathroom with plenty of closet space.  The team that took care of us(Lorenzo, Adrian, Tabo, etc) were very professional and treated us very kindly, all the time.  The o"
" convenience--there are plenty of outlets in the garage to charge your golf cart.  Swimming pool is lovely,  my kids thoroughly enjoyed the pool.  It was very clean and the poolside chairs were in great shape.  Their are quite a few stairs on this property,  I suggest being close to an elevator.   I would happily return to this unit during a future stay."
…
"Definitely happy to have stayed here- I stayed in the Palmita room an the hammock, views and charm were lovely!  The staff - Jessica, Sophia & others were wonderful.  I highly recommend this place - so close to the beach, in the midst of it all, and the staff gave great recommendations!"
"Noisy to the MAX. Would not recommend. Firstly, we did not receive the room we booked at check in. The room we got was unsatisfactory by size and comfort for what we had paid and booked online. We wanted to leave and find a different place but it was already late so we decided to stay. It was a big mistake on our part. Our room didn’t have curtains to block the light. But the worst thing which I feel is downplayed in other reviews is the amount of noise that you can hear from your room. The bathroom is open"
" people from the street. There is nothing to block the noise. It’s almost like if you were to sleep on the sidewalk. If you’re coming to this hotel to sleep, I would 100% recommend finding somewhere else to stay. "
…
This small hotel was just amazing. The staff were so accommodating and helpful with everything. Breakfasts were made to order. We had an amazing view of the ocean and town. It’s a short 1min walk to the beach. Plenty to do here in Sayulita. 
"I reserve for 8 days but in the same Day i wanted to live, i come to work and the WiFi was very bad and the room is not the same of the pictures you only pay because its 10 steps from the beach but Just now the Water in the ocean its dirty and smells so sayulita is not anymore beautiful like 5 years ago  and the hotel was 120 usd per nigth and is only the size for a Queen bed and no more space and a little balcony wow very bad the pictures show bigger room"
"The staff is nice and service is good, good breakfast available on the floor above.  The location is convenient since is close to the beach and right downtown.  The DOWNSIDE: very NOISY. Sayulita downtown is very busy with music playing ALL NIGHT and people partying late. Not a place for an easy sleep."
"My wife and I stayed here in early February during the ""Sayulita Festival Weekend"". We wanted to be right down in the heart of it all regardless of the potential for noise. We spent 5 days there in 2 different rooms and had a great time. The rooms were clean, comfortable beds, AC, flat screen TV with Mexican cable, plenty of hot water and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The town was rockin during this weekend and the noise level was as expected...but not a problem for us...who goes to Mexico witho"
"Great accomadations, clean, comfortable and affordable. Breakfast served was outstanding, location very close to beach and restaurants. Themed rooms are cool but basic, not luxury but will most definitely stay here next visit!"
"This was my second stay at the lovely Sayulita Central. It’s located perfectly, making it EZ and convenient to the beach, restaurants, shops and the main plaza.  The hotel is very clean and comfortable. We had a small refrigerator and jug of water in our room, as well as air conditioning. WiFi and a very nice breakfast of fresh coffee, fruit, yogurt and eggs (prepared as you request) is included in your stay.  Lalo will greet you when you arrive and is happy to answer any questions re: activities or recomme"
"This casa is a pure dream. My friend and I were staying at a different hotel and were kicked out due to a Booking.com error. I were right down the street from Casa Niwalli so we thought we'd pop in after seeing gorgeous pictures online and find out if they had any last minute openings. To our fortune, they did! They had a beautiful king room that my friend and I stayed it together, and then I continued staying there for the week I was going solo in Sayulita. This is hands down the best place you can stay in"
" found me a chiropractor/massage therapist who cured my aching pains in one session) - The AMENITIES: the gardens are absolutely gorgeous. it's like living in a jungle paradise oasis even though you're 2 blocks from the beach and a 2-minute walk into the craziness of downtown Sayulita. The heated pool is wonderful, the chaise lounge chairs are super comfortable, and it's surrounded by beautiful fire pits which makes it glow in a magical light at night.  - The BREAKFAST: cooked fresh for you everyday (and in"

"We stayed 4 days at casa Nawalii, we have been coming to Sayulita for years and it was one of our best experiences. The new owner and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The breakfast was so delicious, you could feel the love the chef put into each plate. We also ate at the attached sushi restaurant and had the tasting menu. Also, incredible.  We can't wait to come back! We will be staying here again and again."
"My husband and I loved the property and were very excited when we checked in. The pool area is beautiful and the location is on the north side of town, which we thought would be nice and quiet.  One issue was that the bathroom was flooded the whole time we were there due to the shower being level with the rest of the floor. It was a design issue--the shower curtain didn't go all the way to the floor, and the shower head was not adjustable, so we just had to deal with a soaking wet bathroom the whole time.  "
" noise insulation, so we both had a very hard time sleeping. Luckily I had noise canceling headphones that I could put on at 4AM, but my husband did not. We got home from our trip absolutely exhausted, which is not what we were hoping for after a vacation. I know this is out of the owners control, but I imagine they could put some measures into place to detract the birds from the tree.   We both agreed we wouldn't stay there again. It wasn't a comfortable, relaxing experience like we would expect for the pr"
…
"I was tipped onto this place by somebody “in the know” about Sayulita. I get why. This little hotel only has six or seven rooms, but somehow has the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to, about the size of a two-car garage, including the patio. The hotel is absolutely immaculate, and the (new) owner is a retired high-end hotel manager who makes this place a showpiece of a boutique hotel. Sayulita is a bustling little surf town, somewhat a victim of its own success (good luck finding a parking place) but"
"We had stayed at Casa Nawalli three years ago and fell in-love with the property and the amazing staff. Recently, we found out they reopened with new ownership and decided to revisit. Luckily the new owner has made minor but welcome upgrades to the property and experience while keeping the same staff. It is still the quiet, serene, and welcoming space as before.   New Upgrades -The pool is now salt water and has a beautiful tiled bottom.  -Breakfast and snacks were made-to-order by a fantastic on-site Chef."
" it.   TL;DR: It's clean, fairly priced, centrally located, and serene. The staff makes you feel like a family member (in a good way). It has a pool, breakfast/snacks, A/C, internet (had a video call in the main house), and anything we needed. If you're going to Sayulita, and not a spring breaker, stay here."
"Cult Wild Hostel has super chill staff. They had a party table out front and the front desk dude played awesome tunes until 10 pm at night. The music and hostel turns off all noise at 10 pm. The beds were super comfy. They had washroom and showers upstairs. Only hiccup was a lots of the loos were out of toilet paper. So you had to be careful which stall you chose. Otherwise great staff. Great location. Walking distance to everywhere..beach, restaurants, pubs. I highly recommend this hostel!"
quiet rooms and air conditioned! no noise after 10 pm..the hostel was pretty quiet..no curtains on the beds so you have to put up your sheet as a curtain..beds are super comfy..had a great sleep. awesome staff! fried eggs for breakfast in the upstairs kitchen. check the washrooms before you go in..many ran out of toilet paper. i would still stay here again! thank you!
"This place is awesome! The beds & linens are ridiculously comfortable. Like, seriously. Better than my own at home. Everyone I met staying there was super nice & the staff is helpful too. It’s walking distance to everything and far enough from downtown so you can get some rest, if that’s what you prefer. Quiet hours are respected, which as a weary traveler I appreciated. Secure, clean, beautiful art. Will be back!"
"My first night I managed to get 14 hours of well-needed sleep. The bunk room is very dark and quiet hours are respected late into the morning. The hostel is located in a quieter part of town just 5 minutes walking distance from the beach and downtown area. While guests mainly keep to themselves, there are group activities scheduled everyday to get out and experience Sayulita life. I was quite satisfied with the kitchen and facilities and for the price you really can’t beat it! I would stay again without a d"
"I really enjoyed my stay here, what was supposed to be a 2 night stay turned into a week! Good activities, nice kitchen, great volunteers, chill atmosphere. Loved the no noise after 10pm rule, made for some of the best sleeps I've had in hostels so far! The showers are really not great though, and the drinking water didn't feel totally trustworthy."
"Beware! Once you check in, it'll be hard to leave. The people and the vibes are best around. Truly a hidden lotus land you can get lost in. I already have my next stay booked. Everyone was so friendly, and even though I was travelling solo - felt like I've known everyone forever"
"You do not fully understand the good vibes until you live in it, brothers from all over the world motivating each other Incredible location and price per night, group activities make this an unmissable stopover Cleanliness and security, I will try to return when going through this beautiful corner of the Pacific"
Cult has been a really enjoyable hostel. I’m still here one week later and planning to stay for another two. The people are great and there’s a good vibe.its comfortable and the nights are cool now to sleep
"Cult Backpacker hostel has such a lovely vibe, lovely people (you will definitely make some cool friends there), and the best is is that it is soo cheap: 100 Mexican pesos per night. I do think that having small vans for every bed would be an amazing and necessary addition to the hostel because it if often very warm during the night."
"This is an amazing hostel! Has a great mixture of fun, chill vibes but also being respectful of their neighbours and making sure everyone is safe is clearly high on their priority list, which as a solo, female traveler I think is very important! Sam, the guy who runs the place, was very welcoming the second we walked into the door (literally into it, our bag was stuck haha)! His contagious smile, willingness to answer questions and approachability makes this hostel what it is. The location of the hostel is "
I found david to be exceedingly helpful  I had issues with my travel and they couldnt have been more accommodating   I would not have any issues staying there  I do not have other details but this needs 200 characters
"Stayed for 9 weeks very recently and loved the rooftop pool and views, short walk to town for dining and shopping and having stayed downtown in the past it was nice and quiet at night!  Kitchenette area set up for ample cooking, also!  Located on the North side, that part of the beach is a tad quieter which is nice and there are also rests. Closeby, if don’t want to cross the bridge into the busy downtown square.  David & Jeannette are great hosts and very helpful, with whatever you might need.  I look forw"
"Stayed at Villa Los Corales for a month Our room was clean and  all the amenities needed were included. The hosts, David and Jeanette were wonderful hosts. The roof top patio and pool provided a  great view of the town and ocean. There were lots of restaurants within walking distance. We enjoyed ourselves and it was sad to leave the hot sunny weather. This location was the perfect place to spend our vacation."
"We absolutely loved our stay at Villa Los Corrales. The location is perfect, the hosts were attentive and lovely, the view from the rooftop is spectacular, and the room itself was spacious, clean, and the kitchen amenities were great.   Would come back 100%!"
"Rooftop patio with an infinity pool has spectacular views.  Easy downhill to the quieter north beach or into town with a short steep hill to climb on the return.  Definitely worth it for the view and quiet (other than roostersand dogs).    Hosts are brilliant, especially helpful. Decor is new but charming. Amenities are as advertised, with drinking water supplied, and everything is spotless - with full room cleaning every 3 days.  Delightful."
"We had a wonderful week staying at Villa Los Corales.  Our room was spacious with a great view into the hillside neighborhood.  The rooftop pool was spectacular for sunsets and a quiet, peaceful retreat.  The location was perfect, easy walk downhill to the town or beach.    Like most places in Mexican towns, the roosters can be noisy early in the morning.  Bring earplugs, and I didn’t hear them at all.    David and Jeannette were very sweet and accommodating.  We would definitely return here happily.  "
We had such a lovely studio apartment. Every detail was considered. The Villa was very clean and all the staff was friendly. The rooftop pool and lounge area was so beautiful. The sunsets and views were amazing. It's a great spot to do yoga as well. The hosts David and Jeanette were wonderful and so helpful. We extended our stay because it was such a special place. The location is perfect. It's in walking distance to all the great places Sayulita has to offer but out of the noise of the town.
"I love Los Corales. My husband and I have been going for years now. It is very close to town and the beach. The swimming pool is  GREAT!! They are friendly and give you your privacy, would recommend anyone to stay here."
"The vibe of Aurinko is colorful, clean and relaxed.  Located right next to the center, you're not more than a few steps from anything.  I spent a lot of time just watching the iguanas sun themselves in a tree across the way from our kitchen / living room balcony."
"David and his wife Jeannette were great hosts! We got to the hotel a few hours after check-in and David was waiting for us. He gave us a tour of the place and showed us to our room. The room was plenty big for four people and was very clean. The hotel is also very conveniently located where you can get to the city center quickly, but are not too close where you get any disturbances. The hotel has an incredible rooftop that over looks the city. We spent an afternoon there relaxing and enjoying the pool. I wo"
"Very cute little quaint hotel with an outdoor kitchen, air conditioned room, private bathroom and close to the city center. The decor was adorable- beautiful plants and tons of color and art all around! There is a pool on the grounds but i never saw anyone use it. They have books available to grab and read too! We enjoyed our time here so much we extended our stay one additional day!"
"My wife and I stayed in the wonderful Palma suite for six days while we attended a destination wedding. We instantly felt very welcome and at home with the simple and classy room with a great view overlooking the town  and south side of the bay. As mentioned, they are great hosts and take pride in providing a great property above and away from the noisy downtown.  The small rooftop area with infinity pool was perfect to get sun or cool off and enjoy the views (i actually preffered hanging out here more than"
"Sayulita is not the quiet surfing town it once was. Anjali Casa Dinina is a serene, very well laid out boutique hotel just a couple minute walk from the centre of everything in Sayulita. The breakfast is small, healthy and self serve, the yoga classes are fantastic, they have all the things you need for the beach to take with you if you want. The grounds and rooms are impeccably cared for and tastefully decorated. Rafael is a fantastic communicator. I couldn’t recommend this place more!"
"Aurinko is a very special place, I liked the color and decoration of the place, the art on the walls, the open space kitchen. The proximity to all the good things in Sayulita (Beach, Plaza, Restaurants), the friendliness of the staff. The only thing I didn't enjoy was leaving."
"Beautiful, clean, secure small boutique hotel.. Close to the beach and centro Salulita. Wonderful place to stay for a night or five. Open air front room, kitchen, table, fridge and stove. Supplied with dishes, coffee pot, pans and silverware. Highly recommended from Utah Couple. Love, love, love."
"Charming and peaceful boutique hotel located on a hill overlooking the ocean and just above the main part of town. It’s a 5 minute walk from the hustle and bustle, but it has the feel of a quiet, secluded getaway from all the action. It was the perfect home base to explore all that Sayulita and the region has to offer. The hotel offered surf and stand up paddle boards, beach chairs and towels to rent for free. Rafael couldn’t have been more personable and was available all day to make recommendations on thi"
"Aurinko Bungalows was a great place to stay.  Steps from the beach and the city center, it's got everything you need for a great stay.  The rooms are clean and well-appointed.  Each room has an outdoor area with a little kitchen and sitting area.  There are fans for the outside to help keep mosquitos away.    Everyone working here is so kind!  I was a solo traveler and they all checked in on me from time to time to make sure I was doing okay.  I managed to arrive right before the presidential election and n"
"Aweful, avoid this place unless you are happy to stay in a filthy hostel, super gross, the bathroom that you share with everyone is gross, somebody had bed bugs in their bed which I am not surprised about. I enquired about activities 2 weeks before my arrival to make sure I would not miss out on surf and yoga, I'm still waiting for the yoga the staff was so clueless and useless appart from Gaby and Alan. Enquired more in the dedicated group but no one bothered replying. I had to ask them to remove a chewing"
"The Property was honestly so great! the location was just a stone throw away from the main town, restaurants and markets, so this meant a great nights sleep away from the Loud music that the square may bring.   breakfast was also a bonus! fresh fruit and nuts in the morning, juice and tea and coffee.   The pool was a great temperature for swimming and came with an ever better view!    I loved the yoga classes available everyday, which I attended everyday, the yoga instructor was great and made the classes v"
"Aurinko is Swiss Family Robinson meets Romancing the Stone.  From the time you ring the bell you are transformed into a Paradise...on a fun, busy, cobblestone street near the beach.  We absolutely loved it.  It was spotlessly clean and the people working there felt like family.  One of the women that lives on site has a darling dog named Charlie who would come and visit us much to her shagrin.  We loved it!  If I had to have a negative I think the pool could use more comfy furniture.  The pool is small but "

"We were very pleased with the proximity to the heart of the action of Sayulita. Aurinko Bungalows is super close to the beach, restaurants and markets. This quanit place is really clean, fresh, and cozy and felt secure. There is a small pool. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Each unit has a covered open air kitchen with fridge, stove, and couches, and each unit has a locked bedroom/bathroom.  There are rooms on three levels, so luggage needs to be dragged up the stairs if on the upper levels. "

"The location of this place was just perfect: it is next to small supermarket, several restaurants, and the beach is few blocks (100 meters or so) away. There a yoga studio within the premises. Good lessons, but having an advance booking for guests would be great.  Rooms are very clean and ac was good as well. Our room was at the first floor, so few people were passing by our room. But the hotel is pretty small, so this did not really bother us. We had a full-size fridge at the room as well. So even the hote"
"My friend and I spent about 10 days in La Redonda, it’s been such an amazing time and the volunteers in particular made our stay amazing! Except this the cleaning wasn’t the best it could be improved. Unfortunately, we found bed bugs in our room almost every person reported bugs in their bed. We told to managers and we were told we could not move room cus the hostel was full, the only thing to do was to clean our clothes and change bed’s sheets, which wouldn’t have solved the problem as bed bugs stay.

"Casa Anjali is a welcome oasis in Sayulita with clean, modern well-appointed rooms, beautiful ocean views, stunning yoga studio, and heated saltwater pool. The staff was attentive, friendly, and Rafael the manager spoke English and was a wonderful resource. I highly recommend Casa Anjali especially if you are looking for a quaint boutique hotel for a family reunion or meditation/yoga retreat.   And, another huge thanks to Vanessa who is super kind and her hard-working husband, Miguel. The staff really made "
"Let me preface this by saying that i think it really depends on the traveler as to how you will feel about this location. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: Very centrally located. Tienda in less than a minute, beach in two, town square in one, restaurant in one. You just couldn't be better located for seeing the town. The staff is wonderful and friendly. The place is cute and they have nice little kitchens. The building is secure. There are cool hammocks to sit in for that great vacation feel. If you like "
Overall the hostel is pretty and charming and has a good vibe. It is well placed downtown close to all the shops and restaurants (although keep in mind that there is a lot of noise downtown at night). Were I was disappointed was the quality of the staff.  They couldn't give me basic information about the town. For example ; they could tell me where were to have a good breakfast or the best place to rent a surf board. They didn't had any activities plan except for partying at night. Also my bed sheets were s
" or pay a small fee for a ride in their golf cart.   - bring pesos. we had a hard time finding ATMs that worked. - beware of swimming in the beach at Sayulita. didn't seem that clean. - if you want a little more peace and quiet, walk to the north end of Sayulita Beach or take trips towards Punta de Mita. Ask Rafael, he'll guide you."
" got a view (some good and some bad). The fridge is clean and cold. There are really great bed reading lights (wish the bed was more comfy). We could see the fireworks on the beach from our living space. But not the actual beach.  Cons: The beds are hard and the linens, while clean I am sure, are functional but not in any way nice. Same with the towels. Same with the furniture in the living space. The nightlife in town is loud and lively until 3 AM every night. This did not bother me as I tend to sleep hard"
"I have been to a hostel once before. But this place is another thing. It is amazing, this hostel was another level of experience. Great place, great people, amazing staff. Next to the beach and to the downtown. 110% recommended."
"standard hostal with typical leisure activities: trips, parties, hospitality, kitchen access, shared bathroom.  The location is pretty good close to the beach and main restaurants. However, is a really small town, so eveything is quite close in a walking distance.  It is informed that noise is acceptable until midnight, but actually it is 2am or at least during the days that I stayed there. So if you look for a quiter place, it´s not the right place for you."

"Where do I even begin about Anjali Casa Davina?  This place was absolute paradise after staying right in the heart of Sayulita for a few nights before.  It was the perfect escape from the the noise and craziness, yet only a 5 minute walk back into it.  If you are seeking a place to party, this hotel is not for you.  Anjali is a quiet, adults-only sanctuary that truly allows you to relax in Sayulita.  Breathtaking views, an incredible pool, stunning greenery and vegetation, the friendliest staff... I could g"
"What an amazing place! All the volunteers who work there are so lovely, kind, helpful and welcoming. I completely agree with their insta (@laredondahostel) - BEST VIBES in Sayulita for sure. I stayed for just under two weeks, in two different rooms as I had two different bookings. One room was an 8 person, the other for 4 people and both were fab, clean, tidy and the beds were super comfortable.

"Perfect location - a bit off the beaten track - quiet, clean, and welcoming. The desk staff (Frank, Lorenzo, Adriana) were most helpful and always professional. The ladies making breakfast every day (Yesenia, Esperanza, Elena) were sweet and kind. Breakfast was delicious and homemade every day - eggs, potatoes, veggies, chilaquiles, fresh fruit, granola and yogurt. A fabulous way to start the day! I would recommend Hotelitos los Suenos to travelers looking for quality and hospitality."
"Hotelito Los Suenos is tranquil, beautiful and calming. The staff are so friendly and accommodating.  The hotel is stunningly laid out.  Open air 3 levels, lots of greenery, 2 pools, 2 yoga shalas, beautiful lighting , gorgeous local art.  The rooms are huge, bright, clean with balconies, shampoo conditioner, body wash and lotion.

"The hotel and staff is lovely, the breakfasts good, on site yoga nice.  Coming from a cold climate we looked forward to the pools but the water was too cold.  1 out of 4 of us jumped in but quickly got out.  Other guests commented on the temperature and were very disappointed too that they couldn't swim. We had to buy our own lighter to light the cooktop and some of the dishes were dirty.  Overall it was a pleasant place to stay, just disappointing to go to Mexico and not be able to swim without freezing."
"Minimalist hotel. No hot water in the pool, no phone, no TV, bad wifi.  Excellent massage, good breakfast. This was an expensive hotel taking in account the services you get.  We saw some crockroaches @ to he washroom. Poor face mask enforcement was noticed.                             "
"Great location, best breakfast! The ladies cooking breakfast were friendly, great service and excellent food. 2 blocks walking distance to the beach and 2 great restaurants, a pizzeria and ""El Jakal"" Room and Hotel are clean! Beautiful landscaping and good Yoga classes everyday."
"We stayed here in February and again in April. The staff is friendly and helpful, the breakfasts are very nice.  The kitchen was missing a few things (they had to run to the store to buy a lighter so we could fix dinner).  We were a little concerned about the black spots on walls (mold?) but overall the room was nice. The pools were too cold to get into so that was a bit of a disappointment. The day we left, they said our bags would be safe at the front desk while we went for lunch. Unfortunately my jewlery"
"We loved our stay at Hotelito Los Sueños. For us, it was perfectly located just north of the hub of activity. So close enough but still quiet at night. The free breakfast was simply amazing. So delicious!! I’m still kicking myself that I didn’t take advantage of a yoga class. I guess I just need to go back! The staff was friendly and helpful. The Hotel was a quick walk to the beach. We found a spot just south with a bar and beach massages. We would give 5 stars if the beds weren’t so firm (but that may be m"
"The 11 days spent were simply wonderful. Well maintained, quiet, personable staff, delicious breakfast served daily. We felt totally relaxed and secure. Excellent value for a clean and convenient hotel close to town"
Had a room up top which was very comfortable and quiet. Great bed and shower but lacked a fridge which would have been handy. WiFi was virtually non existent in the room but OK on the terrace outside the door. Having said that our stay their was great. Local restaurants were terrific and Isabelle went to a lot of trouble to locate us a handy parking spot for our stay there and Jim was kind enough to help me extricate the car from there when we were going. Thanks guys 😎
This is my second trip to Sayulita and staying at Casa Campana.  It was absolutely wonderful each time.  We stayed in Guest room #2 each time.  It was beautiful.  We left the doors open a few nights and fell asleep listening to the waves hit the shore.  That is the most soothing sound.  We spent time enjoying the sounds and sights on the beach from the comfy chairs on the verandah.  Since we were so close to town we spent lots of time exploring and enjoying the city.  After exploring we would come back and 
"A small hotel, with very clean rooms and reasonable priced. The AC units works great, keeps the room nice and cool. Excellent location, in the middle of town, If you want a nice room, and nothing more, this is the place. Great bathrooms. Did I mentioned clean."
 Cheri!!
The Avela Boutique hotel was a 5 star experience from start to finish. The vibe was consistently beautiful and tranquil. With just an 8 minute walk from Sayulita town it was the perfect distance to get into the buzzy party part with a numerous amount of great bars and restaurants. My partner and I were greeted with the warmest welcome and it did not stop there. All the staff were so friendly and always went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be. The hotel itself was sparkling clean and luxu
We stayed for 3 nights. Very clean. Big comfortable bed. Great roof top view deck. Very loud outside and earplugs and windows closed not too loud inside. Great location. Very sterile enviroment decor but everything is right outside the front door for vibrancy! Great price. The room needs a cup to brush your teeth with. A couple floor mats to wipe your feet. All n all I was surprised for the price it wasn' t full every night! 
"Nice and clean, but not enough toilet paper, daily (!) no drinking water Or glass or plastic cups to brush your teeth.  Can use a floor towel in the bathroom so you step in water each time you go in.  Nice over all. "

"We stayed in Guestroom #2 which is the best. Private patio, open air shower microwave refrigerator and amazing view! With village restaurants just a few blocks away who needs a kitchen.  This home is right across a dirt street from the beach and has beach chairs umbrellas and boogie boards for guest use. We hung at the beach for hours and then came home to our private pool. Yes it was paradise.   We loved Casa Campana and plan to return. Sayulita is a neat beach town with LNG beach and rather gentle surf. G"
"Quiet location outside the center of Sayulita, the hotel is very simple but clean overall. The pool is the main attraction here, and the two hot tubs draw a crowd day and night. There is a small restaurant on site that provides breakfast and lunch, but it was closed inconsistently throughout our stay with no prior warning. Food was simple but did the job. The rooms were a bit inconsistent, some with tile floors, others with painted concrete, some with two chairs, others with one, etc. They seem to be all th"
"I would not recommend staying here. We, unfortunately, had to stay here with our family and had an absolutely terrible experience that I wish upon no one, here is your warning to stay elsewhere. The rooms were dirty, bedding stained, and the manager was extremely hurtful and unaccommodating."
"My wife and I have stayed at Casa Amistad many times together, however, this was the first time we brought one of our daughters and her three children, (sadly no longer as ages 11, 18 and 20).  We took over the upper back part of the Hostel for the next nine days.  It was fantastic, the grand kids could walk to the beaches, restaurants, shopping and for my littlest grand daughter the french pastry place, all from a central location, and not worry about them. Connie and Yolanda put up with us for nine days, "
"The small cafe, Flor es Ser was awesome!!! The couple running it were super friendly as well as a couple local customers, Leo and his brother Armando! I had avocado cheese egg toast and a matcha iced drink! Colorful pictures and their puppy, “Monster”  a bonus!"
We been there for a week and it was really clean and the staff was very friendly even though we didn't speak spanish. A little bit noisy but it was a long week-end so we guessed it was noisy everywhere in town that week-end. I would stay again at this place for sure
"If you want to be close to the beach, this is a great option! Clean and has everything I need!  Cable and wifi included ... plus AC...  Overall a good place to stay close to the Plaza and the nice restaurants and cafes. PS.  clean :)"
"Dave and Joan were incredible hosts who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. They know everything about the area and really set the tone for relaxing into the Sayulita life. The space is very clean, great easy walk into town (5 min) but far enough away on a hill to feel remote and more quiet than in the square. I can't say enough good things about them as hosts and the space you will not regret. (Sorry it took so long to write this review D & J)!"
"We are locals and stayed at Avela when our power was down. For the price this place is an utter disappointment and you can stay at many other places in Sayulita of better quality for cheaper.  Stay elsewhere if you are able. While the staff/management was kind when inquiries were made about all of the ""broken"" or non-functioning amenities throughout the hotel, the staff had no desire to fix them or remediate the situation. We had to ask for a late checkout and nothing was offered to make up for all the non-"
"Marcelo was a gracious host, attentive to any questions we had and always quick to respond. My friends and I stayed in the 2.5 casita and loved it.  It was rustic but clean and had wonderful charm. Perfect location - I will be staying here again on my next trip to Sayulita!  Lissa"

"Travelling from Canada to Nuevo Vallarta each winter since 2013 my wife & I have stayed at this hotel on two occasions when overnighting in Sayulita, most recently on Jan.08 & 09.  Previous reviews by other guests adequately describe the rooms, the noise and hotel location within the town.  I will simply confirm that our young, female receptionist was courteous & helpful when we walked in off the street having made no reservation.  She showed us a room that was spotlessly clean with minimum but tasteful dec"
My friend and I were looking for a place last minute to stay in Sayulita one more night. We had previously stayed at an airbnb up the road (which was pretty awful) and so we wanted a place that was more inviting. Erika and Jose were very warm and welcoming and took us in. The rooms have AC and are clean and the location is in the center of it all but still quiet enough when you need to sleep. 
"Clean. Fairly new with a modicum of amenities: a/c, ensuite, tv and excellent location. We found this gem when our previous stay didn't pan out. Beach is a block away and in the center of town. Can't beat it for the price. Very happy we found this hotel while looking for an alternative place to stay"
"My husband and I stayed in Guest room 2 for a week and were very pleased with our accommodations. The room was large with plenty of storage and a huge outdoor shower. We had two balconies with great views of the beach/ocean. The owners were away during our visit but we were very well taken care of by our host Tony, an exceptional young man. Everything was clean and comfortable, enjoyed our dips in the pool in the afternoons. Everything we needed was within easy walking distance. Overall great experience!"

"So 2 days before we were flying to sayulita a 1 star review popped up here for casitas tortuga and then another one the next day.  We got a bit nervous to say the least. However, we got here and are extremely happy.  It is close to everything.  They have umbrellas, surfboards, and boogie boards that you can use.  Even a yoga class on the weekends on the property.The kitchen is more than adequate with a blender for making fresh smoothies.  The family is very nice.  It is really loud at night as you are so cl"

"Cute little hotel one block from the central plaza. This was the second time we stayed here.  There is only about 10 rooms, so it’s difficult to book. Love the ambiance,the rooftop lounge, courtesy tequila, and hammock. The rooms are clean and perfect size. The bathroom is an all-in-one sink, shower, toilet combined (interesting but it works). The air conditioning works well which is important too.  Really cute place for couples, "
This hotel is in a great location about a block from the beach. The Rooms are clean and well kept and were cleaned daily. There was no one else staying here so we had the whole building to ourselves. Air conditioning worked well which is very important in summer!
"I can say that the town of sayulita is a cool little town that did not disapoint us at all, we have traveled around Mexico and only reviewing my favorites. We are not rich people and travel on a budget and Hotel Eden was really nice right in the center of town. We paid about $50 a night and it was quite comfortable, clean with AC, not much more you need. The staff was nice and we are glad we picked this hotel."
"My wife and I are some of the many returning guests to Casa Campana, which alone says something about the property. However, it has been awhile since our last visit and we wondered if it would live up to previous stays. Well, we are pleased to report the place is in fabulous shape and still just as good as it possibly gets in the town of Sayulita.  We booked room #2 once again for it's huge deck overlooking the surf and the privacy it affords being on the other side of the structure, separate from the beaut"

"It is painful to read the cluster of negative reviews from (seemingly) one group last week. We stay at Casitas Tortugas every year when we come to Sayulita, and are staying here right now.    Marcelo has created a beautiful sanctuary in the hustle-bustle of Sayulita. We love the open layout of casitas, the attention to detail, and the gracious hospitality offered here.   We stay in the penthouse which feels like a tree house in the jungle, shrouded by bamboo and accessed by a romantic spiral staircase. Many"
"I simply cannot say enough great things about Casa Amistad and Connie. I stay here every time I come to Sayulita, without exception, for several reasons:  1.) Connie is a lovely human and a natural caretaker, making her an excellent host. She's been here for 20 some years and knows everything there is to know about this place, so her recommendations across Sayulita but also broader Mexico for further travels are amazing. 2.) It's super pet-friendly! I travel with my collie/golden mix, Gus, and Casa Amistad "
"We where in Sayulita for the day, and decided to stay. We found this little hotel close to the main plaza and loved it. Because it is so close to the main plaza it can be noisy at night but they provide earplugs and we didn’t even notice the noise. It has a many beautiful details like hearts in the doors, and a gorgeous terrace. The owner must be an artist that makes us Arabian style Decor with a Mexican flair. The room we chose didn’t have AC, but it was cool enough with the fan.  Very affordably priced!! "
"We stayed three nights and absolutely loved the room.   We were in room 1, which is the heart room.  A magical walkway and a comfortable bed.  The bathroom has a palapa roof which ads to the charm.   There is a noise issue on weekends from the surrounding bars, but just stay up with the party people and it’s not an issue."
We stayed a few nights at Hotel Eden and thought it was nice. It was not the best place but nice. It was very clean and the staff was also very corteous. I loved the town of Sayulita so we spent very little time at the hotel. It was nice
" working everywhere). When we headed to the beach, the Casa has all the necessities with beach chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards for the waves.  While town was packed for the February week we were there, nights were consistently quiet for us.

We usually went to bed early and "
"Hello to future travelers to Sayulita,  While I was fooled by the number of positive reviews, I believe that these reviews are misleading, and I completely agree with the review of AJ1 (that I had also read prior to booking with Hopper, but foolishly ignored). I honestly thought AJ1 had more of a run in regarding his Expedia booking and the negative interactions colored his entire trip. And with so many other positive reviews, I ignored his foolishly.  However, he is shockingly accurate in his review of thi"

It literally never goes out and is strong enough to stream videos and do anything necessary for remote work. Digital nomads, rejoice! 5.) Amenities.

I had just come from a stay at the W Punta Mita (an actual 5 star hotel) and this is only marginally better than a basic Airbnb stay and honestly my Sayulita Airbnb stay (Leavetown Sayulita) was a way better value ($500 for 6 nights).

But our room had an empty soap dispenser, and when we asked for some soap, one of the long-term residents (who it appeared substituted for the owner) said some weird stuff to the effect that they don't use or give out soap.

"I just got back from my birthday trip to Sayulita, where I stayed at the Hotel Hafa. The people couldn't be nicer, and the decor couldn't be more charming. It IS located right off of the town plaza, so noise is to be expected, but you're right in the heart of things, and the beach is only a block away. Reception staff was super helpful with tips (Playa de los Muertos!) and helped me to book an adventure to the Hidden Beach in the Marietas Islands, which is now super limited. My room was a cool oasis when I "

The bar wasn't open when I was there that I saw, so will have to return for the ""best margarita in town"". The attached boutique has beautiful souvenirs, and there are great restaurants in every direction. Café El Espresso on the corner was my morning hub for coffee and food fuel. Everyone I show my photos to are jealous and gasp at how pretty Hotel Hafa is. "

" 3 days of our vacation. I do not understand how June [-],  our Sayulita Life host, could write that her guests found the property to be wonderful with a wonderful host when our party was her guests to whom she had recommended the property. Our party had a much different view of the property and the host. We feel we were defrauded by the owner and the Sayulita Life host. You will be taking a risk if you prepay for this property."
"I recently had to get to Sayulita at the last minute to take a rescue dog to Sayulita Animals so that she could get on a plane to Canada.  On a budget, with a dog, and searching for an affordable place to stay can be hard. Connie replied to my email right away letting me know that it was fine to bring the dog and offered me a great rate. We ended up staying in the dorm room which was empty of people!!  Comfortable enough beds!  Fans great! Clean!  Yes, there are roosters in the house next door and cats but,"

The hotel has all kinds of funky architectural details that make it a unique place to spend time - we had a thatched roof in part of our room, there are stairs made from beach stones, a whitewashed parapet with divans to lounge on, a nice balcony, and inner courtyard."
"I stayed at Avela for two nights with two other family members and was blown away by the staff's care and attentiveness. The hotel is family owned by the most amazing people and I felt so cared for during my time there.   The building is absolutely gorgeous, with the feel of a luxury retreat away from the noise of downtown but still close enough to easily access. The food at the cafe was delicious.   Absolutely 5 star, I will recommend Avela to all my friends and family members. Please support this place an"

I would not recommend this place to a group or a family as we had a very unfortunate experience. Do your own research and look at other accommodations if travelling to Sayulita. We stayed elsewhere for the first portion of our trip and had a much better experience for equivalent cost. Bring your own pillows and sheets if you want clean bedding but I would highly advice against staying here.
 :)
"overall, i would say that my boyfriend and i thoroughly enjoyed our stay at avela boutique hotel. the hotel itself is just as stunning as its pictures. the location is wonderful, a quick ten minute walk from town that will keep you in shape and help you work off all those margaritas you’ve been indulging in. one thing to note though is that you can hear the noise of the cars from the pool, and at times it can be really loud. i’d recommend trying to get a room in the back of the hotel.   the pool is gorgeous"

"Me encanta este lugar!! Definitivamente lo recomiendo!! Los anfitriones son excelentes personas, siempre fueron muy atentos. El hotel se encuentran muy cerca del centro y de la playa (para llegar al centro caminando son aprox. 7 min.). El lugar está impecable, las villas son muy cómodas y modernas; cuentan con todo lo necesario, son tal como se muestran en las fotos y la alberca es de lo mejor!! Definitivamente volveré a hospedarme con ustedes. Gracias por todas sus atenciones!"

The villa had everything the 4 of us needed, including a basic kitchen and living area, bath and beach towels enough for four, air conditioning in each bedroom and daily cleaning services.

"Casa Pata Salada was a perfect choice for me and my sons to stay for a family wedding at Villa Amor. It was very clean, quiet and comfortable. Everything felt fresh and well maintained. Our unit (#9) felt very private and yet open to an open field next door. The ocean views were incredible and watching the fishing boats going out was mesmerizing. The walk to town was quick and easy. I would definitely go back. "
"Hotel boutique,económico,decoración tipo mexicana,las camas y almohadas deliciosas,perfecto para descansar,aunque no esta en la playa es muy centrico,5 minutos de la misma caminando. En las habitaciones no llega ruido externo. Importante mencionar que no tiene recepción, por lo que hay que comunicarse a los números de contacto al llegar."
"My partner and I stayed 3 nights here, and we really loved it. It is more like a house than a hotel, with 4 to 5 private bedrooms for guests, and a communal kitchen, livingroom, and sitting room. We rarely saw the other guests, so it really felt like having a whole house to ourselves.  As it is not a typical hotel, there is no front desk, so you need to call ahead to have the caretaker let you in. This fact was stated in the listing, so we were aware of it. We called them as we were driving from Puerto Vall"

The location is a bit out  from the main town centre, so it is not as noisy here as it would be in some of the other hotels.

"Had an amazing experience in Sayulita Mexico and was so lucky to Hostal Tortuga. The atmosphere is my favorite part of the place, there is a backyard where people chill with a pool and a hanging hammock. There is a roof on top with a nice view of Sayulita which is where is spent my mornings. The staff Manuel, Jose, and Mario are amazing people and will go above and beyond to help you. They know all the good spots in town. Go join the culture and you will never want to leave."
"Wow very nice hostal !  nice look, very clean, pingpong and babyfoot table, kitchen and has a pool ! staff are very friendly and helpful.  I really loved my stay overthere.  it's about 10 mins walk to the beach of Sayulita."
"Staff make you feel at home, very friendly and eager to help you out!  Very clean, short walk into town. Beautiful common area with ping pong table, pool and comfortable lounge chairs. Will be back again!"
The staff at the hostel were absolutely incredible- the most memorable part of my stay for sure! They made me feel at home in their community and clearly were eager to share their town!  They gave great local tips to maximize my stay and are genuinely interested in making sure you are comfortable and happy.  Great common spaces and atmosphere to meet other travelers as well.  Hostel is super clean and nicely decorated.  Close to town without the noise of the town at night.  The best hostel I've stayed at! 
"Staff kind and friendly, rooms always clean, vibes always good, safe, economic. You have all u need; from a pool to a full kitchen, spacious and very well equipped common areas. Hostel is very new, kind of hidden but once you find it you gotta stay there!! Looking forward to come back"
"I loved my time in Sayulita, and especially at Hostal Tortuga. The staff is small, but incredibly friendly & accommodating. Folks were always available to answer questions, provide recommendations, and even to hang out in the spacious & well-equipped common areas. Hostel is very new, so accommodations are clean & beautiful. Location is ideal, and I would certainly stay again! Muchas gracias :)"
"Great place to stay! everyithing is always clean and the place is very safe. The staff is amazing, very kind, giving support and tips all the time...I would deffinitely stay there everytime...keep it up that way!."
the front desk staff were awfully rude to some friends of mine. i had invited them up to the rooftop but they were stopped on the way up by the front desk staff (bald male). Instead of politely telling them that infact it was exclusively for the use of the guests he belittled them and was extremely rude to them and even lied to them about even having a rooftop because they werent dressed as if they stay here (. So all in all would not reccomend staying here as sayulita has lots more places to stay with a lo

The rooms are clean, large and have some convenient kitchen tools if you require. I was able to make my own ice with the icecube trays, and bottled water from the Oxo located next door. Beds and pillows are comfortable. The pool is fabulous as well as the lounge area. There was some construction happening, so I imagine they are making the hotel even better. About a 10 minut"
"Our friends had a great time at Casa Tortuga!  It’s a short walk from the beach, restaurants and all that Sayulita has to offer, all while being out of the hustle and bustle of town center.  Great for a group of friends!"
Stayed here one night.  This place is very well managed. Service is great. Roof deck is really nice.  Cool pool.  Rooms are super clean and modern. Beds comfy.  It’s a bit off the beaten path.  Can be quiet or loud depending on traffic out front.  Good WiFi Refrigerator cooktop in room.  Bathroom is very modern but functional and nice.  
Loved our vacation to Sayulita! Our stay at Villas Tortuga was great. Accommodations were new with everything we needed. Rent a golf cart and you’re minutes away from the beach and thriving downtown Sayulita.
"Se encuentra a 800 metros del centro, un poco lejos, pero es una zona muy tranquila y si se puede dormir, a diferencia del centro. Las instalaciones son modernas y amplias, la cocina es sencillamente perfecta. Los cuartos frescos a pesar del clima insufrible."
Booked this lovely little hotel last minute - a little hard to find as it is off the main road but worth it.  Our hostess Yaquelin greeted us warmly and showed us to our basic but comfortable room. The next morning was Valentine's day and she had made muffins and placed name cards on each for her guests. Very reasonably priced and well located to everything in Sayulita.
"Villas Tortuga is perfectly situated in the charming town of Sayulita, steps from the beach in the quiet north end of town. Comfortable and modern, the newly renovated Villas Tortuga provides the perfect home base to enjoy everything Sayulita and the surrounding area has to offer: lazy pool or beach days, sunset yoga classes, jungle hikes to remote beaches, whale watching, and fabulous restaurants. The options are endless and you’ll find yourself wishing you had booked a longer stay!  We spent 6 weeks in Vi"

"This is a great hotel, worth the stay. when i booked the wrong room and showed up with the family, the owner quickly helped me to upgrade rooms, and helped me once more when i messed up on the days. she takes great pride in this place and it shows and goes out of her way to make sure you have a great stay. the hotel itself is just far enough away (the town can get and stay pretty loud well into the night) to be nice and quite. fear not though, its just a quick walk to town square and the beach. the rooms ar"
"Really nice Hotel, really clean, run by nice people. The room we had was a real apartment with shared living room and kitchen. There is 2 separate bedrooms, each with private bathroom, which make it ideal for 2 couples or 2 families. The terrace on the roof top is amazing, with a refreshing Jacuzzi, and a great view. 10 minutes walking distance from downtown. We loved it, and we'll be back!"
"A la entrada del pueblo lejos del bullicio, parking, wi fi, con personal super amable y atento con baño privado en cada habitación y zonas en común donde puedes ver televisor, netflix, cocinar y almacenar comida en refrigerador. Excelente opción que no puedes dejar pasar... te hacen sentir en casa... NO TE ARREPENTIRAS"
Cute place and a great price for what you're getting. They provide drinking water which is a nice perk. Just lock up any extra money... for some reason mine grew legs and is now missing! My friend and I have now requested our room not get cleaned for the duration of our stay. 
The Hotel was everything anyone needs on a vacation! Place is immaculately clean and a short walk to the main plaza and beach. The owners are super sweet and helpful! There is no television but who wants that in such a wonderful place!   I highly recommend this hotel! Oh most important very confused beds!
"This is a colorful hotel with really nice and helpful staff, we stayed there for a couple of nights, it's 10 minutes away walking from the center, at night the path might be dark but it feels safe, plus is good value for the money."
I loved the place  It was basic   but very clean  and they were the nicest owners ever  I had a minor issue (not about the hotel) and they were helpful and nice beyond what could have been expected from them just a bit out of town where it is quieter and a nice 7 minute walk to the center
"The hotel is very charming, wellkept and clean.  The owner and the staff is very openminded and helpfull.  The walking distance to the center of Sayulita and the beach is easy to find and takes only a short while. There you can find a nice place to eat or take a swim in The Pacific waves.  If I ever go to Sayulita again, I will centainly book a room in El Corazon :)"
"This hotels is a perfect choice if going to Sayulita. The rooms are beautiful and have everything you need, it is located in walking distance (7 minutes) from the center of Sayulita, and the whole ambient is just amazing around Corazon Sayulita. Jaqueline and her family are welcoming and warm in their way of being, and you feel almost as a part of the family when living there. It is our second time there, and we will come back very soon. Absolutely recommendable for anyone going to Sayulita for holiday."
My daughter and I were back pack traveling up and down the central pacific coast in Mexico. We  booked a room  at the Corzaon Sayulita. two months ahead through Booking.om. When we arrived to the Corazon they said they had no room for us and that we had been re-booked.  I never received any e-mail stating I had been rebooked prior to departing on our trip and I have never had that happen before at the last minute. The Manager at the Corazon sent me to another hotel in Sayulita stating I had been rebooked th
 months and the Corazon accepted my reservation and told them nothing about rebooking me at another hotel. Bottom line the Corazon overbooked over Christmas and left me and my daughter without anyplace to stay after traveling 240 kilometers to get there before dark. The Corazon caused a nightmare for us and did not care. I would advise everyone to stay away from the Corazon.so that does not happen to you and your family.
I’ve always dreamed of horseback riding on a beautiful beach. Juan ( our excellent guide) at Rancho Mi Chaparrita led us through the jungle and out onto a very beautiful beach at sunset. The horses were healthy and well cared for which was important to us. A photographer accompanied us and the photos were well worth the additional charge. Omar gave us a very educational and entertaining tequila tasting after our ride. We highly recommend this experience!
"My daughter and I had a terrific time. Giovanni, Andy, Ernesto and crew were all genuinely lovely, helpful, and fun as hell. There was a smidge of physical activity so if you are hoping for a relaxing day out this probably isn’t it, but it wasn’t too much even for a lady of a certain size (who may or may not be me). Even the people in our group who were initially nervous (who may or may not have been me) were grinning by the end. Recommend!"
We did multiple activities with these guys and they were great! Zipline was awesome with Giovanni and Andy! They were very professional and funny. Felt very safe the whole time. The ATV excursion was amazing also. Ricky lead our group through trails to some unbelievable views and a beautiful secluded beach. Back at the ranch the entire staff was great. They have a lot of fun with the guests and make everyone feel at home. Overall 10/10. Would highly recommend and will definitely be back!!
"Goes through jungle and beach during the 1 hour tour, it’s really beautiful! Carlos did a great job teaching me how to ride the horse and control it. I haven’t been on a horse in over 10 years and I was galloping by the end of the tour. Great way to see sayulita."
"This is the 2nd time visiting Sayulita and going on adventure with Rancho Mi Chapparita! Both times we had a blast as a family and I highly recommend a visit!   We have a family with young kids 2.5yr, 4yr, 5 yr, and 6yr! We felt very safe while zip lining and 4 wheeling. They were extremely attentive to our concerns and made us feel safe at all times! Very friendly, safe, easy access from Sayulita, great people that have a great time! After finishing the kids swam in the pool while the adults relaxed and ch"
We booked our stay 4 days before our arrival and there weren’t many options left in Sayulita. Sayulita Suites was one of two properties available and the price was perfect. We were a little scared but we went for it.   It was great! We took a Taxi in from PVR by walking across the bridge from the airport and paid 700 pesos (cheaper than taking the ones inside the airport).   When we arrived at Sayulita Suites our room was ready and the manager greeted us with a quick tour and some space to decompress.   The
" 5-10 minute walk from the city center which we thought would be terrible the first time we walked but after being there for for 6 days we realized the walk is really nice and it was great to be away from the bars and restaurants at night. There were people walking to and from downtown at all hours of the day so it felt safe even though the lighting along some of the side streets was poor.   There was a lot of noise from roosters, the neighbors and loudspeakers driving by selling stuff. I can sleep through "
Sorry to say but I didn’t find the accommodations up to par for its price point. I stayed in the open air Palapa room. I found it to be rather dirty. Cushions were stained on the furniture. Refrigerator was dirty. The floor needed repainted.  The courtyard that seemed like a lovely spot to hang out from the pictures was being renovated. All chairs and benches were being painted and there was no where to sit. There was no mention of the courtyard being closed when booking.  It was also not swept the 3 days w

"I have spent 2 months in Sayulita Suites. at the beginning i didn't know that I would stay so long, but this house contributed a lot in my decision to stay longer. It's a beautiful place at 5 minutes of walk from la plaza which is the center of Sayulita, and as everybody say, it's better not to stay in the center if you want to sleep at night. It's also a peaceful place which allows you to disconnect with the marvelous and crazy atmosphere of Sayulita. Nixs, the manager of the place is a guy with a great an"
" this room that with it being open aired and facing the courtyard there is little privacy. You can hear everyone and they can hear you.  You will also hear very loud music from the night clubs nearby.   Plus side was that it was close to the beach, restaurants and shops.  Unfortunately I wouldn’t stay here again. I saw much better options for the same price.  The place has a lot of potential. Hope they can get to a higher level."
"Great location away from the noise but close to everything. The rooms are lovely and comfortable. The best part of Sayulita Suites, though, is getting to know Lyn. She took us to the botanical gardens and told us about all her favorite restaurants. I asked, ""Can I say in the review that you taught me to play MahJong?"" She said, ""Sure. I'll teach them all to play Mah Jongg."""
"This is our fourth stay with Lyn and each time is more enjoyable. The rooms are perfect, everything you need is there including a blender for pina coladas (which we then take to the rooftop patio for the hillside views in the late afternoon sun).  Lyn very kindly offered to drive us out to a beautiful trail and we hiked back to town for a swim and cervecas. The neighbourhood is an oasis away from the busier, more touristy parts of town. We hope to be back soon, thanks Lyn for your hospitality!"
…
We were lucky enough to spend several nights a Sayulita Suites recently. Lyn set us up in the upper room for what was supposed to be only one night but was able to extend it to three. It is a large open format floor plan with two sides of the room completely open to the environment. We absolutely loved the room. It is airy and the view is amazing. Has a large kitchen area with a bar and stools for eating or drinking. It is attached to one of the communal open patios on the rooftop of the building. The only 
"The hotel is exactly as it states.  A little funky, which we loved, it's clean, everyone was great.  There was some construction next door, we really didn't hear it, but the owner came and apologized to us for the daytime noise.  This is a great place to stay if you want to party in town.  It is loud at night, but it's an experience that we really enjoyed. "
" kitchen and dining area. Very clean and modern appliances if you are inclined to save a few bucks and cook at home.  The property itself is pretty much near everything while being far enough away that you don't have to deal with the downtown party noises on the weekends. We walked to nearly every part of town and visited most parts of the beach easily. There are beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards and plenty more beach items available to borrow if needed too!  Lyn was a great host and one day took us to"

"Our family stayed at La Morada for 10 days in January and had a fabulous trip. The staff were accommodating, helped us with our infant, went out of their way to give us advice. The facilities were clean, and as pictured. The hosts also generously took us to a secluded beach near their jungle home one day. We felt like part of the Morada family!"
"Great location  ten minutes from the beach, without the busyness of the streets by the beach.  This was our second year.  We stay for the month of january.  Lynn the owner took us to some beautiful areas around sayulita and the bus depot is 5 minutes away so we did some trips on our own too.  Our suite was the sunflower suite, there was a stove and fridge with the basic utensils to cook your own meals or again it is ten minutes to a variety of dining and stores.  I would reccomend sayulita suites to everyon"
"Had dinner at La Morada with their ""guest"" Japanese chef who was working in Sayulita only for a short period of time.  My girlfriend and I had tempura appetizers and miso soup both of which were excellent.  He offered 3 different kinds of tempura and miso to choose from and we tried the veggie tempura and miso. For the main course we had chicken teriyaki and red snapper filet with a chutney sauce.  Both very nice and attractively presented. The service was very good and the atmosphere in the garden was peac"
We're working with the owner of La Morada to find real estate in the area. He invited us for breakfast and it was great! There are friendly birds in the courtyard and the staff is very welcoming. We will return and stay here for a couple nights. Perfect location.
"Most fantastic positive experience at this new B&B with very pleasant hard working staff  The inside courtyard wonderful breakfast experience   Chose over Hotel Villa Amor  which was featured wedding venue for all the wedding party (at 73 I was oldest relative of the 24-year of bride)  I love being in middle of this small surfing town two blocks from beach half a block on left is 24-hour convenience store OXXO and half hour on right is 24-hour convenience store Kiosko,   and in front along the quiet street "
Quintessential B&B in the heart of Sayulita. Gin was so warm and welcoming. Always helpful with suggestions of where to go and what to try. Even an impromptu paddle board lesson.  Rooms are wonderful and don't forget to just stop and chill in the beautiful garden courtyard. Which is also where they serve breakfast ... it is not to be missed.
"La Morada was great and the staff were very helpful in providing instructions on how to get there from the airport. My room, #5, was perfect for what I needed and the room faced the courtyard so it was quiet at night. The bed might be small for two people, but worked for me just great. The breakfast each morning was hearty and hit the spot to set me up for a day of surfing each morning. Thanks Gin and the staff for a great stay.  The location was great too... with lots of restaurants nearby. I recommend the"
The hotel is in the centre of town with bars next to it. Many stairs to get to the room. The staff are no very knowledgeable and try to service the clients and their children while doing. their job and they take money with not receipt and claim not to receive it.
"The hotel is right by the plaza and the noise from the bars filters straight into the hotel. The next door neighbour watches tv at full blast from about 5 pm until the bars start. It's impossible to sleep until the bars stop - 1:30 tonight and waiting. Other than that, the room is simple but clean, with a little sunny kitchen, and there is a little rooftop patio."
"If you like ugly hotel rooms that are really noisy, then this is the place for you. The room: what words to describe it? Let's see...ugly, devoid of any charm would pretty well sum up the place.  As for noisy, there is no front door; only a wrought iron gate that leads down a dark corridor to the staircase to the rooms on the second and third floor. This means that ALL sounds (passing cars, barking dogs, laughing people) are heard loud and clear inside the room. Add in that the stairwell seems to be especia"
"Pros: Our room was right on the beach. When the air conditioning went out, the staff had it fixed quickly. The room was large.   Cons: The grounds around the entrance were pretty enough, but around the side and back they were unattractive. Lighting at night was poor and so walking to our room was difficult. No attention to details, paint splashed in windows, the bars on the windows were filthy. The chalk paint used around the sink in the bathroom came off on your fingers when wet. There was no reception are"
" was a disappointment. I rated it ""average"" due to the fact we were right on the beach. "
Easy surfing when the surf is lower for beginners.  Not great for non experts during high surf.  Easy access and boards to rent on the beach with lessons cheap.   Go during week days not weekends (too crowded). 
…
First the positives: Location is right on the beach. We had the lower room right on the beach and could see surfers and beach action all day. The room had a large kitchen area which we did not use. Our air conditioner stopped working and the staff attended to is quickly. They called a taxi for us when we left. Negatives: No reception area. The grounds when you entered the premises were attractive but around the side it was dirt and some stored junk. Not attractive. At night the lighting was non-existent aro
" important except to empty the toilet paper basket. I had to ask to have it emptied on the alternate days. Toilet paper in that heat is not pleasant. The bars on the window were filthy. Conclusions:  The room itself was not bad, and location couldn't be beat. But for the price, which was not cheap, I would look for something else next time."
…
"If you have read all of the reviews on here and are confused, allow this particular review to help provide clarity.  Not really a place for kids although it would work fine if your kids aren't squeamish about bugs and geckos.  All adults should have absolutely no problem with this place.  It's not 5 star by any stretch but 2-3 stars for basic amenities.  We rented both upstairs and downstairs just last week.  This was for an all guys week-long stay.  Yes there is the odd bug and gecko.  Yep, no air conditio"
"Nos fue un poco difícil encontrar el lugar, pues solo se ve una pequeña puerta con un letrero pequeño. Al llegar tuvimos que pasar por cables y una máquina de soldadura lo cual fue inseguro. Llamamos para que nos dieran la habitación y tardaron unos 10 min, nada grave pues nos dejaron accesar a la terraza que es la única área común de estos estudios. No había protocolos de sanidad, nadie nos tomó la temperatura o nos dio gel ni usaban cubrebocas. Se notaba que mas personas habían estado en la terraza pues l"
 fine.  Did not use stove.  Seating available for about 20 people.  Spacious with both beds on opposite ends of the room.    Downstairs:  Closed / shuttered suite with windows.  Same creature status as the upstairs and same amenities with less available seating.  Bring household bug spray to spray to use in corners and ledges.  We did this just to ensure less creatures as a deterrent.    LOVED the proximity to beach.  Super close.  That alone made the stay worth it.  Wifi available in courtyard only and doe

El chico que nos entregó nos comentó que todas las habitaciones eran iguales y el precio era el mismo, que es la única habitación que tenían disponible.

Old school hotel some rooms with no a/c. Beat room is upper beach house room. No lobby see cleaning lady to check in. No paper down toilets but no daily trash service so that was unpleasant. Staff didn’t  pick up empty bottles in common areas. But this beachfront hotel is a bargain if you don’t mind some discomfort 
My best friend and I stayed in apartment 3 at North Side Studios. It was a great value for the room and had all of the basic necessities.   What I really liked: - location; it was very close to the beach and the center without being right in the busy area of the plaza. It was no more than a 5-10 minute walk to the main areas and there are plenty of grocery/corner stores and restaurants nearby. - the room; it's a modern decorated studio room with a kitchenette so we could make our own breakfasts/food when we
"I was planning on renting Cola de Zorro at Siete Palmas in Sayulita. I love this town and place looks beautiful. Unfortunately, with the Covid virus going around, I did not want to fly and the US/Mexico border is closed. Even if it opens, I didn't want to take a chance on not getting my deposit back less than 30 days. I gave my deposit last February. So, Dec. 1, I requested my deposit back. I was informed I would only get back $1500 which is half of what I paid. Rob sent me an email saying he would pay me v"
"I have been staying at Siete Palmas every year for the past four years and have grown to love this place - the tranquil swaying palm trees (it's namesake!), the location is perfect, quiet and the accommodations have always been fine. The property managers (love you Marcie, Sylvia and Jorge!) and support staff are the absolute BEST! The property recently sold and the new owner has crammed an invasive four-story unit right next to Siete Palmas, absolutely destroying the ambience and solitude of this property."
" sounds of Sayulita celebrations and gentle surf.  Now, you can hear everything going on in the adjoining units. At night, the lights shine right in to the Siete Palmas bedroom. Solitude - GONE! Privacy - GONE!  The small pool will now be shared by four units. What the hell was this new owner thinking??"
…
"Normally I would have rated this place with 4 stars but there were a few things which made me rate it only average.  First what we liked:  The property is beautiful open and airy, one block from the beach, 7 or 8 minute walk to the plaza and downtown Sayulita, has a nice pool right outside the front door and the casita itself has a very nice bathroom area.  Also Jorge the property manager was friendly and efficient when we needed his assistance a couple of times during our 5 day stay.  What could have been "
The worst hostel of a two month tour of Mexico. Do not stay here.   We booked two beds in a dorm judging by the photo of the small dorm on bookings.com. The number of beds was not listed.   The dorm we ended up in was 10 beds and terrible.  No working fan Hugely uncomfortable bed The ceiling leaked on to bed and electrics Toilets didn't work properly  The electrics were very unsafe (socket coming out of the wall) The room was teaming with mosquitoes and had no nets / air circulation  The rest of the hostel 
"Extremely racist, and make a lot of differences between local tourism an foreign one!

It’s amazing, how the make differences with people!  Amazing! The hotel itself is average! Rooms small with. Average prices!  Hope she read this! But as we say in Mexico!

"DO NOT BOOK a BUNGALOW here. We had been here 10 years ago and came back to rekindle our honey moon flame. The bungalow at $82US a night had a bottle of water that had been accumulating dust for...10 years. The bedding was 30 years old with 2 limpy pillows but WORSt of all, the mold and mildew was overbearing!!! We got in late at night. I have allergies. I said to hubby,  ""Can't stay here, will get sick."" We grabbed our bags and went up the road. Thank goodness at 10:00 at night Theresa at the Diamante let "
"We had a looong drive down to sayulita with our problematic van breaking down several times.  Luckily we made it here to this gem of a campground.  The owner went above and beyond to help us get our transmission rebuilt!  The workers were very kind and showed us great hospitality.  Facilities we're clean, free WiFi, reading books, ping pong, and not to mention it is right on a beautiful beach!  When I go back to sayulita, I will definitely stay here again."
"My boyfriend and I drove down here from Colorado in April 2018. Theis and Christina welcomed us like family. We had a few vehicle problems on the way and our van about died when we arrived in Sayulita. Theis went above and beyond to help us get our van fixed. He even called the mechanic and drove us to him in Puerto Vallarta. We love this little gem of a spot and can’t wait to come visit again. We are going to stay here every time we visit. The spot is just feet from the beach, the facilities are shared but"
"We stayed at this place for 6 nights: nice spot, right on the beach, close to surf spot and town, it's true that the facilities could use a little bit more love and also not running down of toilet paper when you pay 400 pesos/day, but over all nice. We were thinking of staying an extra week, so we ask, kindly, to Christina, the owner, if they had a price per week. I guess no: she immediately started to be rude to us by saying that we were not well educated to ask a question like that, that she was well educ"
"I had a terrible experience in multiple ways. Making and confirming reservations with the owner, Thies, was difficult. He did not respond for several weeks to multiple emails. What he claimed was a beachfront bungalow was actually behind a beachfront bungalow. It had a slice of a view of the ocean from the patio and none at all from the dark room which was dominated by the bed and smelled strongly of mildew. What this place has going for it is its easy access to the beach.  However, that comes with so much "
 music enough to sleep) I told Thies I was considering moving to a quieter place and asked if he would refund me for the nights I had already paid for if I did.  He said he would.  I felt that was generous and I told him so. I thanked him. I then made plans based upon that understanding. When I went to get my refund from his assistant the assistant told me Thies had told him to only give me a partial refund. Since he had no explanation about why Thies was not doing what he had said he would I went to ask Th
…
"Just imagine you and your family arriving at the hotel to find out that the Owner did not confirmed nor registered our reservation... and later when we emailed him/her to let him know that we had to find another place he mooked on us telling us: ""... thankyou for leaving this lovely place on the beach to another Guest ..."" Luckly for us we found another nice place and enjoy our weekend.  Beware of Sayulita Trailer Park. "
"This is a charming place to stay in Salyulita. Many of the residents spend the winter months here, every year. There is beautiful beach access, a gathering courtyard, a chapel, restaurants...just about anything you want. This is a relaxed place to stay, and very affordable!"
"Had an absolute rubbish stay. The day receptionist was often in a bad mood but would occasionally answer basic questions if you were brief. The night guy, however, was very aggressive and would answer any question with sarcasm ( ""You want to find a good restaurant? Open your eyes!"") and screamed at me for politely asking what could be done about my bed being occupied by someone else. There was even an air of possible physical violence from his part in his way of talking. Quite scary, never had an experience"
" was very hot and muggy (expect 29c at night) and fans were not available except for a very small one that didn't make any difference. Personally I'm not very annoyed by noise but the hostel is situated in a bar area and the windows are bars without glass so you're basically an active part of anything that goes on in the street, at any hour. Avoid at all cost!"
…
"A good place if you need exercise.  It is near the top of Gringo Hill and that means about 400 paces up from the plaza.  It seems to be more of a house that has been ""converted"" to provide for 2 rental units called adult guest suites.  The one we had was called ""Felicidad"".  It had 2 beds (matresses on concrete slabs), a 3x7 foot balcony, a small shower area and a place to hang your clothes.  There is a coffee maker and a mini-bar fridge.  There was no door for the bathroom with the toilet beside the shower"
Located right in the heart of Sayulita is convenient. Multiple items of clothing went missing from our room along with our room & locker key on our last nights stay at the hostel. We stayed for 1 week and our room didn't get cleaned once not even our bin emptied. Alex the receptionist is helpful and nice! Others not so much. 
"My extended family rented two of the villas at bacabes and loved it.  There were 5 kids ranging from 3-9 and 7 adults.  Our stay far exceeded our expectations. The staff was so friendly, attentive and helpful. It felt like we had a 5 star resort to ourselves with all the services and amenities without the crowds.  We watched whales daily from our veranda and enjoyed the pool, beach and searching for shells and creatures in the rocks.  We would highly recommend bacabes."
El hotel es muy básico si lo único que buscas es un lugar para dormir  este cumple perfectamente bien la alberca es chica pero en buen estado los desayunos logran cumplir con el objetivo sobretodo los desayunos con huevos y no es tan cercano a la playa hay que caminar dos cuadras pero la zona es muy calmada esta del otro lado de la fiesta
"Atico was the first place I stopped when I made my way to Sayulita. I haven't had a hookah in quite a while and the bar looked super hip, so I figured why not?! I first sat down at the swinging chairs at the bar. I'm not very tall, so once I ordered the hookah I went and sat over at one of their tables in the lounge area. Customer service was excellent. The hookah was amazing and they had a lot of really good IPAs. I hung out there for probably about an hour listening to their music playlist consisting of A"
"We stayed here 2 nights and both evening the Pool was taken over young people who weren't staying at the hotel. Music, drinking, If you want to part with the local kids this is your place. Too bad because it is a very nice view and clean room."
"I liked the prices especially. It was affordable. All rooms face the sea, there are palm trees but they don't obstruct very much. The pool is nice, not too much chlorine either. The pool or rooms don't get direct sun, it faces the wrong way for that. You have to chase the sun at the edge of the pool to sunbathe. It's not crowded now, so it wasn't too much of an issue. Security codes to get into the property is good. The location is good very walkable too. Love hearing the waves at night. I got some much nee"

Wow !! This place is amazing. The staff was awesome and the on-site maintenance man was so professional and friendly. I can’t wait to go back with our family. The views were amazing and located steps from the beach. You can walk everywhere because of how close everything is. 
"We stayed there for 4 weeks and loved it.  Very quiet, clean and upscale.  King bed is very comfortable, kitchen well appointed, maid service daily.  The plentiful supply of plush towels is amazing.  Loved the proximity to town, beach, just steps away.  Pool area is very large but seating is set up for privacy.  Grounds immaculate and constantly managed by friendly staff.  Going back for another 4 weeks Feb. 2019. "
"Perfect location....perfect accommodations.....right at the beach, but also a nice pool and a balcony with each room....walking distance to all the wonderful restaurants.  We have come to Sayulita many times and stayed in some wonderful places, but this is without question my favorite.  "
"This place was nice, clean and had a great pool that overlooked the beach which is right across the street.  The room has double-pane windows which drown out all the outside noise.  Also, about a 5 minute walk from the middle of town, it's the perfect place to stay.  Oh, the little kitchen has a blender and we were able to make our own fruit smoothies every day!!"
It was perfect walking distance to the beach perfect walking distance of the restaurant everything was clean the only problem was the water coming through the shower TV was kind a high and small but the view and the place and the staff everybody was great
"La Esquina has everything you want for an amazing, stress-free stay in Sayulita. It's right on the beach, has an infinity pool that overlooks the ocean (and the beach-side bar!), and is a couple minutes' walk to the main square in Sayulita. The whole complex (8 units or so) is gated, so it feels very safe. The room has excellent A/C (not the case at all places to stay in Sayulita!), a safe, great wifi, a balcony, and is very clean. Our unit also included a kitchen. All units also include a water filter mach"
"Después de que tuvimos problemas con otro hotel, que Sayulita estaba hasta el tope ese fin de semana, fuimos recibidos con las puertas abiertas en este hermoso lugar. Están a 10min del pueblo de Sayulita, pero la verdad no importa mucho. Las cabañas son hermosas, te desconectas de todo, y el cielo en la noche es impresionante. Nos trataron súper bien :D Esperamos volver muy pronto, estamos realmente muy agradecidos porque hicieron de nuestra estancia algo memorable. 100% recomendables."
"While we've visited Sayulita before, this time we decided to stay overnight and see what the nightlife was like. We chose to stay at Posada Estrella as it was advertised on both AirBnB and on Expedia. We booked through Expedia but were suspiciously asked via email to pay again using a different method. We ignored that request and had no problem checking in. Good thing we were careful!   The room was a studio with a ""kitchenette"" and a cold, weak, gravity fed shower. We felt like natives ;-} But the location"
"This is a wonderful relaxing and safe place to stay. I have now been to the bungalows twice over 2 years, and be assured we will be back.  It is 2 blocks from the beach, it is in the main square for shopping and food, yet is still extremely quiet. It has a very homey yet authentic feel to it.  I would suggest it to anyone."
"Just returned from a 10 day vacation in Sayulita, Mexico and stayed  at this wonderful little hotel.  The location was perfect, right on the plaza and just 2 blocks from the beach.  It was over Halloween and it was so much fun to celebrate in the plaza and enjoy some of the culture of Mexico.  This hotel is right in the middle of the fun, but surprisisngly quiet and secluded.  The garden environment was peaceful and beautiful.  I would highly recommend it. Great value!!"
"Los recomiendo muchísimo tienen todo lo que buscaba y era la primera vez que íbamos a sayulita..el cuarto limpio, el servicio y todo lo que necesitábamos lo teníamos a la mano, la encargada Sandra fue muy servicial desde que llegamos el primer día la verdad nos gusto mucho y vamos a volver.."
"we had the nicest stay st Casa Conchita. Who knew this idellic gem was hidden away right off of the plaza!  We loved the rooms, and the patio-and having a coffee shop and cafe downstairs is a huge bonus!   You cannot beat the space for this price so look no further! "
"Villa Poema de Amor is a beautiful three floor, 3/4 unit house with the best views in all of Sayulita.  Our family of eleven rented the entire house for Thanksgiving vacation 2015, and we could not have made a better decision.  All three floors have 180 degree views of Sayulita bay and the ocean, and the infinity pool overlooks the town and Sayulita bay.  The concierge, Nick, was so helpful and responsive over email to coordinate our airport pickup, golf cart rental (highly recommended!), horseback riding, "
" located just above Villa Amor on the south end of the beach, and has its own trail right down to Playa de los Muertos.   Our stay at Villa Poema de Amor was the perfect choice for our family vacation to Sayulita."
"We have been visiting Sayulita for more than 15 years and have watched businesses change and grow. With a multitude of options available, I wouldn’t go anywhere else. Shelby and Javier have created a remarkable oasis in the heart of this bustling yet charming village add to that their local knowledge, bicycles and surf lessons, and the newly renovated spaces. Seriously. It doesn’t get any better. "
"We LOVE Casa Conchita.  We have stayed there twice, and have nothing but good words for this little gem. The newly remodeled rooms are amazing, the location cannot be beaten, and the new coffee house, Cafe Miscelanea, is the BOMB!    We borrowed their bicycles, rented their surf boards, and even took a private surf trip with Bicho, one of the owners.  Seriously, stop looking and just book a room. You won't regret it."
"There is so much to tell about this extraordinaire B & B.  Beginning with our host Bernadette', an amazing woman with impeccable taste to create  and capture the comforts of home, all the while embracing the ecological environment, which surrounds her lovely home. Not a single need was not met during our brief 3 day visit.  The food served was fresh and tasty, served like we were royalty, on fine china and linens.  All the while the mood set with candles, music and lighting, delightful ! The rooms are new, "
" are really, quite unbelievable, all the while hearing the constant waves of the ocean.  If that isn't enough the mountains, and jungle provide a stunning and beautiful landscape .  The most beautiful birds and wildlife right there surrounding the home, providing a constant spa like ""sonata"". Romantic, or Zen either way, this is a rare find. It's number one on my list, for every year."
…
"Very beautiful and relaxing! Great host and wonderful breakfast.  It's a bit of a walk, but worth every step and so peaceful. Our stay here with Dadu made our vacation! Highly recommend staying here if you're in Sayulita. "
"Hola, me recomendaron mucho este lugar y me gustaría contactarme con ustedes y conocer los servicios que ofrecen porque me gustaría viajar con mi pareja, por favor algún teléfono o correo electrónico. Muchas gracias!   :)"
"The casitas are nice, great view from Rm#1. However, lots of steep stairs. If you want to stay at the top, best to condition a month in advance. I would've given the place a 4 rating but I like my sleep. There are fishing boats directly in front of the property that get pushed off the sand beach out to the ocean by dilapidated trucks in need of muffler repair. This ""launching"" of boats can occur as early as 4:30 a.m. and persists as long as people are chartering boats. Aside from loud mufflers, they are spi"
" staying. The little beach bars offer umbrellas/chairs on the beach so it is nice to use those as long as you purchase a drink or food from them. Otherwise, the Casitas has chairs and umbrella you can take to the beach. You can also get massages on the beach in multiple places for as low as $25 USD/hour. The weather was perfect, high 77-85 real-feel 87. The property manager is great and very helpful."

"Wife and I stayed here for a week mid-October. We were in 2 units (#7 & 9) during stay. Others have mentioned it in their reviews, if stairs are any sort of issue for you, this ain't your place. We were probably a bit more aware of how much alcohol we consumed in town because of this fact--not an entirely bad thing. That said, we absolutely loved Casa Pata Salada! Never had any noise issues but we did have our doors and windows closed as the October heat was still a thing. Both rooms were exactly as picture"
" excellent appliances. Beach towels were provided so no need to pack those for the trip.  We had a couple minor maintenance issues pop up while we were there, taken care of promptly by the on-site staff (daytime).  The pool was wonderful, always shade to be had during the day if we wanted to get out of the sun. A frig in the back corner was a perfect spot to stash drinks and food while you are hanging out. The beach in front is OK, this is where the fishing boats are along with the smaller surf break for be"

"This place is hand down the best hostel of all time. I made the mistake of booking it for only 3 days and then switching to Selina. Although, Selina is nice it doesn’t have the magic of Viajero. Selina is nice on the outside but the rooms are dark and musty. Viajero has amazing activities, an incredible view and the vibes are high. It doesn’t hurt that everyone there is super good looking. I was traveling solo and met friends I will know forever. The atmosphere of Viajero brings people together. I should al"
"The deck, pool, and rooftop bar are absolutely stunning! But I wish I had stayed somewhere else as this hostel is best suited for 20-something heavy drinkers, I think.   My private room was lovely if pricey at over $100 usd/night once you add in taxes. The free morning yoga, Friday salsa lessons, and breakfast are nice perks. But the place is just constantly loud and I really struggled to sleep with some of the drunker guests pretty much screaming outside my window all night. I felt bad for the hostel's nei"
"Photos tell all. What you see is what really is.  Eric, Rosey and Meche, the house keepers, are treasures and will go out of their way to please. I highly recommend giving yourself a gift and have them cook dinner for you."
We had a amazing journey in Sayulita specially thanks to the Hostel which is very nice (the breakfast and the view 🤩). The staff is amazing and we made a great team between guests and staff members. We loved it so much as we also extended our trip. Definitely the best place to stay in Sayulita ! You will love it !! And last but no least do not forget to try the yoga classes (included) 🧘‍♀️  on the rooftop before breakfast !
"Las instalaciones son buenas, y el trato del personal excelente. Te hacen sentir como en casa. Son cercanos, atentos, la comida es estupenda y siempre están dispuestos a atender cualquiera de tus peticiones con una sonrisa. Si vuelvo a Sayulita repetiré."
"We stayed @ Casa Buque to celebrate a special birthday for my sister that incl. my 80yr+ Mom and 2 best friends; 5 women, we had a blast!! The house is in a beautiful setting, french doors for lovely ocean breezes and falling asleep to sound of crashing waves. The house was authentic in style, decor, comfort, and all around accommodations. The staff of this property is lovely, including a very friendly little pup named Lulu!!! We had them cook for us a few times and both meals were delish. The house was eve"
" property and to the private beach, but nothing crazy unless you have issues with steps. Casa Buque is also a short walk into town or taxi service easily available. Let's just say that the Sayulita Sisters had an awesome time."
"Las recepcionistas en especial nina son muy gentiles y se toman el tiempo de darnos recomendaciones para el viaje. La comida es de 5 estrellas y a buen precio Dani, Alejandro y Gabriel son extremadamente atentos. Andrés el bar tender hace unos cócteles espectaculares!  Hay un ambiente familiar en el hostal, la alberca es riquísima con una vista divina de la playa y tienen buena música. Los cuartos son muy limpios el clima funciona riquísimo las camas son cómodas y el cuarto privado de verdad vale la pena.  "
…
"The house is off the beaten path, very beautiful surroundings, very comfortable, complete with everything you need. Rosie, Meash, and Eddie are there to manage and care for your needs. They made us 2 fabulous meals and it was great to have someone cook, serve and clean up.  The private beach, and small pool are a plus. A wonderful time Was had by All, 5 of us. Myself, my 2 daughters and 2 of their friends, all adults."
"We have been renting Casa Buque (lower level) many times over the past ten years or more. The house is consistently well maintained and comfortable. We love the quiet location that is convenient to the town, the friendly and helpful caretakers, and the house itself.  This house is perfect for two couples traveling together or a small family. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with an open sitting area and kitchen in the middle. The views are amazing and the small pool is a nice addition. "
"We rented all three of the casas.  They have one of the best locations in Sayulita.  There is semi-private beach, beautiful views of the ocean, and a nice small pool.  The location is about a mile from town.  We rented gas powered golf carts b/c I had young kids and grandparents.  The roads at first are a little intimidating, but not bad if you get the gas powered golf carts.  It is very convenient to Playa del Muerto and the beach at the bottom of the hill is good for supervised young children.  The owner "
"My husband and I spent a long weekend in the upstairs unit at Casa Buque in early December 2013, and we found it to be one of the most relaxing places we've ever stayed in Sayulita. The private beach accessible just down the stairs was a glorious swimming beach just around the point from Playa los Muertos. The deck and room provided endlessly fascinating viewing to what we came to call ocean TV. During our time there, we saw schools of fish jumping to escape predators from below, whale spouts, shrimp boats,"
"We are extremely happy with our 7 day stay at La Villa Buena Vida.  Our casita Limon room was perfect.  Quite, and very roomy, lux bedding, and the shower water pressure was refreshingly wonderful.  The small fridge kept our beer & wine cold plus food for quick snacks and meals.  The room was furnished with a roomy armoire, and the kitchenette cabinet was well stocked with cook and barware.  Downtown and beaches are an easy quick walk (comfortable shoes in Sayulita are a must)  Owners are incredibly generou"
"New owners, lots of updates, traditional Mexican style decor. One two bedroom, two bath (sleeps 4), three one bedroom units (sleeps 3) each with fully equipped kitchen, bathroom. One studio with bath.  C Entire villa can be rented accommodates 15 people."
"My family and I stayed here for a week last july and we're already missing it so much, we had a great time and loved the location of this property, it is close to downtown and beach, the courtyard is very nice we had an amazing time there  and the pool is great for kids and adults. Sayulita is a wonderful magic town and Villa la Buena Vida is a great place to stay, we hope be back there soon."
Dairy free options! I got the most delicious ice popsicle which was effectively a whole bunch of the most delicious fruit on a stick.  My friend had an ice cream in a cone and she also loved it! Would definitely return.
"It's a bit scary choosing accommodations on the internet -  sight unseen, with minimal reviews - especially when the cost of the place is fairly inexpensive. We took a risk and were pleasantly surprised. My partner and I stayed in Casita Papaya - a one bedroom unit on the ground floor - for two weeks this winter. Villa Buena Vida was exactly what we were looking for. This is not a high end, luxury place but it is super clean, comfortable and has an ""at home"" feeling about it.  Now, for those who are into cl"
" service is offered weekly, the staff were around everyday and were happy to clean as needed/desired. There were plenty of towels, the bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was fully equipped with pots and pans, dishes, a full fridge, stove, microwave, a blender, and lots of ice cube trays. Purified water was always available. Since it is a smaller complex, we were concerned about noise from neighbours, but we soon found that the other guests staying there were very mindful of each other and we had no is"
"Wa kika is always the finish to great night in town. The selection of fresh fruit popsicles with and without sugar, with and without dairy are incredible. I’ve been going here for years and love it every time I return. We need these in the United States."
"Great location.  They're right by the main plaza and a short walk to the beach.  The rooms are pretty clean.  I stayed in the Oceano room, which is between the Sol and Playa rooms.  Noise wasn't much of an issue.  The Playa room has a window overlooking the street.  I was worried about the noise given it's location, but It was not an issue.  Bring earplugs if you're a very light sleeper just in case.  There's an Oxxo and Kiosko nearby that are open 24/7 (if I'm not mistaken).  I would definitely stay here a"
"This place is on top of the ice cream parlour by the same name. It is family-owned, well-kept, with friendly and accommodating service. It is located right in the center of Sayulita, only a minute ti the beach (unless you have really bad flip-flops!). The rooftop terrace is really nice. "
"We stayed from Sunday to Tuesday and it was perfect. It comes with a kitchenette and your own bathroom. A couch to relax on and of course your comfy bed. It was clean and the terrace was nice. No walking through a hotel to get to it, right outside your door AND the ice cream shop down stairs was delicious! Beach was a few blocks away so if you forget something you can just walk right back to your room no problems. "
"I just got back from Sayulita and already want to go back. Wa kika was the perfect choice, as I like to be in the heart of everything when travelling solo. I stayed in the Oceano studio, which was super-cute and spotless and well-appointed, with lots of space for one person and cozy for a couple. Great little mini-kitchen with a comfy sitting area by the window. The unit had lots of hot water, plug-in outlets and strong wifi, and AC, which was a nice bonus but not necessary with the ceiling fan. The bed was"
" -- it's so convenient. Light sleepers will want to bring a pair of earplugs, but this will be true anywhere in town, and I slept right through the street noise most nights. You can't beat the location if you want to be in town -- it's above the Wa kika ice cream shop! I had an ice cream at least once a day, so delish. Tessa and Rodrigo were wonderful hosts, very helpful and kind, and Tessa helped me sort out surfing lessons with an awesome teacher (see the Surf It Out review). All in all, couldn't have ask"

"This little place is amazing! It's located right close to everywhere you want to be in Sayulita. With steps away from the beach, restaurants and shops, it couldn't get any better. And look out for the iceream shop right below. It will get you everytime with the most delicious treat on a hot sunny day!  The hospitality there is so great and all the rooms are very clean. With only 3 rooms on a private roof top, it feels very comforting and relaxing. It's nice walking to your own little roof top patio everytim"
 can't wait to go back!
"This place was totally amazing!  Pictures do not do it justice.  There were 5 family members staying here, and we all had plenty of room.  Everything we needed for a month's stay was supplied, and Moises, the gardener, and Nati, the maid, were there every week making sure the grounds and pool were kept up and we hade fresh sheets and towels, and the house was thoroughly cleaned.  The nicest, most gracious people who did everything they could to help.  We were about two miles from town, a fairly easy walk on"

We saw lots of whales, and incredible sunsets every single night.  I was worried about getting bored, but that never happened.  We read a lot and drank lots of pena coladas and bloody marys   The morning light coming into the house was warm and peaceful, and every morning there was a scratch on the kitchen door and there would be Ella, the "

"This might be a great place but the photo attached is from CASA DUENDE not Casa Duende Vista, 2 totally separate places. Casa Duende, located a block from the town square and the beach, is a 3 bedroom, 3 bathroom vacation rental with a fantastic outdoor patio as shown in the photo."
We had a fantastic time at Casa Jubiloso. The casa is beautiful and completely relaxing  with amazing views and a pool to die for. Cari and Craig were super friendly and easy to deal with. We would recommend their place to anyone. Thank you for such a fantastic place to stay!
"Stayed here a couple of times, incredible view, really clean place, 1 block away from the plaza and everything you need, hosts are great and very friendly, low price and the rooms have good space, highly recommended!"
"The moment you walk through the gate you are greeted with fantastic views which take your breath away! The house is big, spacious and superbly furnished with all the facilities you would expect with such a lovely property. We have never been somewhere where we have felt compelled to relax and watch the world go by both in the garden and the pool - including witnessing the most fabulous sunset!! Sadly our stay was far too short but if you are looking to get away from everything except the sound of the ocean "
"This house is one of the best-kept secrets in Mexico! I stayed with my young family and we had the trip of a lifetime. The views and ambience are 'magical', really something that is hard to describe. A typical day was waking up and having breakfast as the sun comes over the mountains behind - walking to the secluded beaches through the jungle paths - jumping in the pool - bird watching - lying in the hammock - trip into town for dinner and nightlife. I took some drone shots to try and do the place justice i"
"stayed in the English Country suite which is compact but works for a couple.  A galley kitchen equipped well enough to make breakfast and light snacks.  The grounds are beautiful and well maintained with lovely views over the bay.  Sadly, We missed all of the sunrises and sunsets because it rained consistently all 5 days we were there.  Santiago very helpful to hook up the DVD and bring us some movies to watch!  Also, he offered to go to town for us if needed to buy groceries.  Our only cautionary comment w"
"Fantastic place, highly recommend! We have been coming to Sayulita for many years, and this is definately the best place we have stayed. Mario (the owner) is friendly and helpful, and the accomodations are hilltop which means there is a cool breeze throughout the day - very welcome when relaxing during the day out of the heat. The view is spectacular and its a minute walk to town. We will be back for sure!"
"Great Place to stay in Sayulita!! Friendly, safe and fun. Our group ended up staying an extra week because the the place was so great.Highly recommended!"

"Friendly owners and 4 perky chihuahuas welcome you at Casa Duende! Huge, wide windows make for excellent ocean/village views and great ventilation. King-size bed provides all the room you need and more! Each bungalow is different and has its own arty personality.

Very centrally located, less than a minute's walk to the plaza. Not the place for a quiet retr"

"WOW where do I begin?!  My husband and I stayed at Casa Duende for 3 nights after ending up there by last minute reroute as Tulum (Yucatan Peninsula) was evacuated due to Hurricane Rina.  Man OH man do things happen for a reason! Sayulita is absolutely gorgeous and a true tunnel to authentic relaxation.  The rooms are very artsy and gorgeous with breathtaking views.  My husband was concerned that there was no air conditioning but because of the location up the hill, the breeze at night was more than enough "
"Wow this place is a little slice of heaven! The view is spectacular, the gardens are perfectly maintained and immaculate and the house is beautifully furnished and decorated. The host, her family and the house manager are incredibly friendly and helpful. Can’t say enough good things about this place- me and my my family absolutely loved it. This place is just perfect. Stay here! You won’t regret it! I know I will be back! :-)"
" night of sharing stories with great people.  The chihuahua guard dogs are adorable.  The location really can't be beat.  I loved the short walk down the rolling cobble stone path each morning to get our breakfast burritos at Choco Banpana, a great open restaurant right by the beach.  Can't wait to return!"
"From the moment I first inquired about this place, Suzanne was very attentive and quick to communicate. She made the process quick and easy, being very accommodating, and helpful. A golf cart is not necessary but there are many stairs which was good exercise and needed to balance the lounging around the pool and beach time. The place was spotless and cleaned every day but Sundays. Santiago and Tiade were very friendly and knowledgeable, should you want any recommendations on great places to eat, etc. The vi"

Arrived with no vacancy's in the entire town. But they had another amazing room for us. Every time we brought a friend over they could not believe how nice it is. Neither can we. Still best place to stay in Sayulita. This was our second time there in two years.
"We stayed over the Christmas vacation and had an incredible time.  Our appartment was comfortable, very clean and had all the amenities needed to dine in every day/night if we wished.  The patio and pool area is so relaxing and inviting.  Our hosts (David & Michael) were attentive and informative.  They arranged for the most amazing whale watching tour with Nico. Due to new Canadian regulations, they even made our COVID tests appointments and followed up with the clinic for us.  We were in excellent hands w"
"Last week my family and I had the wonderful pleasure of staying at Casa Kukana.  I knew I was going to love it based on the photos online but the actual house/grounds far exceeded my wildest expectations.  Our family of 6 rented all 3 rooms and had plenty of space.  The yard is simply divine with beautiful and lush gardens, plenty of lounge chairs to relax in, an adorable shaded gazebo area and a gorgeous infinity pool overlooking the main beach of Sayulita.  I loved that the home was up in the hills with a"

We stayed in Amixtli and absolutely loved it as a couple.  It had a perfect kitchen, wonderful breezes, nice big king comfortable bed, super comfy pillows, great shower and roomy bathroom as well.

Had the luck of meeting David and Michael and their adorable dog Harry when we and another couple visited and stayed at Xocotla. We had always been at all inclusives so staying right in a Mexican town was a bit of a culture shock. David and Michael were perfect hosts and told us all the ins and outs. Their place is really comfortable and relaxing. We had the pleasure of going to dinner with our hosts at an excellent restaurant they suggested. Everything is nearby but the stairs or hill in and out of the dow
 ocean's edge on our last night at Si Senor. Whale watching at Sayulita Orca with Nico was a breathtaking experience. You'll never get closer to the whales that this! Truly a memorable holiday. 
…
"I love the fact that Xocotla is located very close to the plaza but at the same time right in the jungle. The neighbourhood is quiet and it's very easy to walk around. The building is set up on a hill and somewhat elevated which allow you to enjoy a nice breeze and the ocean view. There are 3 apartments or studio to choose from, whatever fits your budget or needs The place is well maintained. Michael and David are great hosts and are very helpful if you need advice about Sayulita. Will be back for sure!"
I stayed at Xocotla for the last 4 weeks and can't sat enough good things about it to do it justice.  For one the owners David and Michael are most welcoming and made me feel like part of their family.  They're a fountain of information for all things Sayulita and its local customs and festivals as they're very involved with the local community.  But that's a bonus on their actual property as Xocotla is a hidden sanctuary in the heart of Sayulita.  It's only a 3 minute walk from the central plaza and 5 minu
" beach holiday.  They provide beach umbrellas, boogie boards, even a Frisbee! It was a joy staying there and was very sad to leave but I'll certainly be back!"
"10/10 for our stay. We've been coming to Sayulita for 15 years and this is hands down the best place we've stayed. Hospitable, clean, spacious, and super pretty. Right on the beach and the perfect walking distance from town. I want to move in permanently."
"We are a family of six adults. I am so happy we found Las Hamacas. Three spacious onsuites with king size cozy beds. Each of the onsuites have there own unique design. The living area had plenty of room for everyone. Pool right outside the back door. Two minute walk to the beach. If you rent a golf cart you can go anywhere in town within minutes. Management, security gaurd, and maid staff where all very helpful and kind. We hope to be back next year!!"
"My extended family rented three houses at Las Hamacas for a 7-day family vacation at Christmas time.  We had done lots of online research and reading of reviews before booking, and we had an absolutely fabulous time.  We had three generations represented, ranging in age from 1 year old to 70 years old, and I can truly say that it was just what we’d been hoping for.  The houses were spacious, clean, colorful, beautifully decorated (yet not too fussy) and managed to be kid-friendly. We loved that daily maid s"
" pool.  But the big draw was the beach…just on the other side of the gate. We had beautiful views, excellent beach access and close walks to shops in the town. Lawn chairs and umbrellas were provided with each house, which made it extra convenient. The office staff at Las Hamacas was friendly and responsive to our needs.  We have already told so many people about this wonderful place. We definitely plan to return."

"I love this place - great location, right on the beach and exactly what we needed for our vacation! The staff was responsive and helpful, plenty of room to spread out and very comfortable. This was our second visit and just as great as the first time!"
"This was our second stay at Las Hamacas. Location is perfect for Sayulita - far enough outside of the town core to be nice and quiet, but just a short walk away. The space is amazing with comfortable, spacious bedrooms and fantastic common areas inside and out. We'll be back!"
"This villa exceeded all of my expectations! The location was absolutely perfect, right on the beach, north of the crowded center of town, but only a short walk via sand or road with so many fabulous restaurants nearby. The kitchen was decent for cooking (not necessary but we made our breakfasts and one dinner), WiFi is strong (if you must stay “plugged in”), and there’s stylish comfortable furniture inside and out. The hot water heater works well but is smallish, (that’s more of a factoid, not a complaint) "
Just returned from a wonderful stay at Las Hamacas.  We were in the Casa Alegria unit.  We were three couples and had plenty of room.  The compound is right on the Beach a bit North of town.  It is quiet and away from the thumping late night Bar Scene noise that can be annoying if staying in town or in the hills overlooking town.  It is flat at Las Hamacas so can be great for older folks (like us) who don't want to do 150-200 steps to get to a place overlooking town.  Communication with Las Hamacas was easy

Great location—-close to the beach close to town 🌴🌺💕what more could you ask for? "
"Macondo Bungalows is a lovely, old Mexico style property with multiple room options. We stayed in the Traveler Palm for 3 nights.  The price is right for high season - albeit it simple accommodations.  Nothing fancy.  The bed would be challenging for us for more than three nights but others may not mind.  It’s open air so you can hear more than you may want to sometimes, but that’s part of the charm.  The location has a secure entrance.  The owner was helpful and welcoming.   "
"I had the Courtyard bungalow for 11 days.  It is nice and quiet, back from the street, and has a great little area in the kitchen to do computer work from. Cleaning service was excellent, even my shirts were rolled up or folded.  Highly recommended."

The Villa is gorgeous and right on the beach, filled with lush jungle plants and bougainvillea.

I stayed at Villa del Oso for five days for my brother’s wedding which was held at the house. I typically don’t travel with jewelry but was assured that Sayulita was safe and brought some items for the various wedding events.

We initially assumed she misplaced them but later she found cash and a Nintendo switch missing from her room too. None of those items were in the safe. I assumed I’d be OK since I did loc

I can’t say enough about our stay here. The pictures don’t do it justice. It is absolutely gorgeous with stunning views. Very clean and they made sure to help us keep it clean throughout our stay. We had a few meals there and I wish we had more. The food was wonderful and the staff was amazing.
"14 of my best friends and I stayed at this beautiful property in Sayulita for 7 days.  The whole time we were there it felt like a dream. The home is perfectly situated on the hill with complete privacy , ping pong table, volleyball court, infinity pool and hot tub. We loved the house so much that we did not want to leave especially during sunset.  The interior of the house was just extravagant. The bathroom in our main room was the size of my apartment in states. If things couldn't get any better we were s"

More than enough room for the whole family and tons of space for activities.  It's right on the beach and the views are amazing.  All of our friends and family were amazed the moment they stepped foot on the property.  I cant see how anyone wouldn't want to have their wedding here."
"I couldn’t decide how I felt about this place. The room was nice, and the bed was comfy. The pillows were awful, we got two more, and they were equally as bad. Lots of windows, I had fans were in the room. Under the bed was very dusty. I loved the bathrooms- outdoor, private, nice sinks, but the shower had NO pressure. If you have any hair at all, you won’t be able to rinse the soap out, let alone get your hair wet enough to lather any shampoo into it. There was no hot water, at all. The outdoor kitchen are"
" bed on the rooftop deck have a nice palapa shade cover, but all the nice painted wooden furniture isn’t there anymore. There are chairs with that thick plastic tubing for seating that is so uncomfortable to sit in and leaves marks on your skin.  Jenna was really nice and accommodating- I accidentally locked myself out of my room, and while the housekeeper was there, she doesn’t have keys, so Flor contacted Jenna for me and 20 minutes later Jenna was opening my door, having left whatever she was doing to le"

"This is a nice clean place to stay,  nothing fancy but very comfortable. If you thinking to go surf in Sayulita CBO is a nice option.   Josh (the owner) was friendly and give us  advice about restaurnats and Sayulita in general. In CBO the internet works great."
"Casa Buena Onda was perfect! The room and the facilities are very nice and the hosts are wonderful. The location was great - close enough to everything, yet far enough away to not be bothered by noise from the town square at night. Everything you need is within a one or two minute walk. I appreciated the privacy and the amenities offered and would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a great experience at an amazing price."
"If you like to be close to the party without hearing it, this is the place to be :).  Close to the town center but far enough to sleep at night.  Best place to stay.  It's just a short walk from the center (5 min).  The roof top is very nice.  There is a hammock that is the most comfy ever...  The host are very nice and they make you feel like you are at home.  Believe me, you can't go wrong :D."
"Staying at Casa Buena Onda was everything I dreamed of. I went on a solo surf trip to Sayulita to escape the New York City madness during Thanksgiving — all I wanted was a clean and quiet place to stay that was close enough to the downtown area and the beach break. Casa Buena Onda was all those things and more! My room was huge (I stayed at Camarone Room) with a lovely terrace and access to a little kitchenette, where I would make coffee and oatmeal every morning. The rooftop deck was my happy place after s"
" was heartbreaking leaving Sayulita and Casa Buena Onda, but I'll definitely be coming back again soon!!"
…
"Very close to the beach & the center of town.  Terry was very friendly, thoughtful and always making sure our visit was going OK.  Provided a second fun for our room as the weather was pretty warm for us.  THANK YOU TERRY!!!"
"I have stayed here a few times and everything is cool here. The beds are nice, the people a friendly, the rooftop area is great to chill in. The one flaw if the breakfast that doesn't really get served until lunch. It is not served at 8:00am, not at 9:00am not even at 10:00am. I went out for breakfast and returned and they still didn't have it served. I would recommend putting out bread or something earlier."
"Upon arrival, we had to wake up the front desk worker at 9:30am to speak in person about how we wanted to cancel our accommodation. I had previously attempted to contact the hostel via their official e-mail many days before the refund cut-off date but got no response. Once the staff reluctantly emerged from his room, he told me it would take a few days to get my refund. He explained that I had to cancel through the website I used to booked my stay on - which was the official Lush hostel website. The only co"
" have filed a case for fraudulent charges with PayPal based on the fact I only spent 30 minutes in the building and was charged over $360.00CAD. Of course the hostel is not co-operating with PayPal so I am feeling like it's a lost cause.   I wasn't going to leave a negative review until I started receiving e-mails from the official Lush e-mail account (that had previously been ghosting me) begging me to leave one, so here it is. I only ever saw one person ever working there, and I saw him out and about arou"

I have been asking to be refunded (no show up) but there is no answer from the manager. I dont now what is going on. Im continually receiving evaluation emails from the hotel but no answer about my reimbursement.
"My friends and I arrived in Lush planning to only stay for a couple of days. We had so much fun and loved the place so much, that we extended our stay numerous times and eventually ended up staying for a month! The hostel itself is very comfortable, with great facilities such as a pool and a really nice rooftop bar. There is a free cooked breakfast in the morning, including coffee. The dorms themselves are comfortable, with the options to choose between an 8 bed or 12 bed dorm. There are also nice private r"

The activities they run during the day are very varied and always loads of fun, such as jungle hikes to nearby beaches, trips to other towns and volleyball matches. At night, there is always a great atmosphere in the jostles bar, which is the best place in Sayulita to start your night out. Local DJs and bands play there on a regular basis and they have really good drink deals, like all you can drink Margaritas for 1"

"The recepcionist are all volunteers so they don't care anything, the room (8 people shared room )was a mess, the barhroom was SO dirty, it seems that the they haven't cleaned it in a long long time, and of course not hot water. In the time i was there they didnt even change the bag of  trash bin.. the breakfast was late  and poor, the dont care to improve it. and its really expensive for the service they give. To be fare, they should have a rate half of what they have or make a lot of improves. It just a co"
"Upon entering, the whole staff really didn't care that a guest entered the building. It rather seemed like they found my presence inconvenient. Without saying much, they talked to each other for a couple minuntes, pretty  much ignoring me, and ended up handing me a key and showing me the room.  The hostel is being cleaned every morning but looks gross after a couple hours (especially the bathroom). There was all sorts of stuff laying around, including peoples' underwear. Also, It's burning hot because there"
"The room was clean and well kept but needs improvement. There's no door to the shower and the water is usually cold, which in December is not appreciated. Is hard to sleep due to the outside noises, especially dogs, cats and roosters, and some noisy neighbors that keep the party late. But the beds were comfy. The location is strange, on a dirty road but only 15 minutes walk to the town center. WiFi is hard to get, we had working WiFi after6 days into our stay. If you are very low maintenance, this is a good"
"We booked this place a bit last minute, as we were just in Sayulita over Thanksgiving with our kids. Returned to look at real estate, and found Meson Del Perro was available over NYE. The online presence is poor but hopefully Tripadvisor will put them on the map. It's located as you're coming into town but quite a walk if you want to head into town. We already knew we wanted a golf cart to get around, so no problem for us, but maybe others. The condos are only a few years old but could use some structural m"
We have been staying at Los Almendros for almost 10 years and just love it. The condos are quaint and fully equipped.  It is a short walk to town and to the beach.  The staff are very friendly and the pool is always clean.
We absolutely loved staying here. The condo was beautiful and in a great location. It was quiet but still walking distance to anything you could need. The pool was the most amazing pool for kids! We will definitely be staying here again. The staff was great and helpful too.
"We recently returned from Sayulita and another wonderful, relaxing stay at Los Almendros. We have stayed at a few other places in town, but Los Almendros consistently makes our vacation easy and enjoyable. I think this was our 8th stay here because it provides everything we could want: well maintained grounds and buildings, big pool, friendly staff, security, well-appointed condominium with amazing housekeepers in a very quiet part of town."
"Beautiful place with a beautiful view. Lovely staff, very friendly and helpful. Perfect place for family or friends. If you like to listen to music, be sure to bring a Bluetooth speaker. Just remember you have neighbors so don't play it too loud."
Everything was great with the stay. The location is great as it's close enough to the main strip and the beaches but far enough that noise isn't issue. The rooms and grounds were very clean and safe. Staff all super friendly. Wouldn't hesitate to book again.
My family had an excellent time. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Our accommodations were more then what we expected. Very clean and never felt unsafe.  Beautiful area and would love to return again someday.
"This is a residence, not a hotel. Well maintained, secure, and geared to quiet family retreat. The staff are extremely helpful and very pleasant. It felt like a community and we could not have found a nicer condo environment. It is close enough to walk for amenities and the beach. The kitchen is well equipped except for a tea kettle,😉but I have learned to travel with one through experience. Wifi is 10 by 10. I don't hesitate to recommend this property for your next visit to Sayulita. See you next year!"
The place was perfect to host several of our wedding invitees. Very spacious rooms and great amenities. Clean and well maintained. Very friendly staff. Great pool and common areas. We definitely recommend it.
The rooms were spacious with king size beds in each room.  Patio off each room.  Nice jungle view. The bathrooms and kitchen were very clean.  It would have been nice to have a broom in the facility as sand was easy to track in on the floors. Maid service was excellent.
"We were in Villa Heidi. Everything was perfect. Condo is well stocked for cleaning supplies, paper goods, and cooking equipment. So many times we've walked into a condo with a coffee maker and a washing machine with no coffee filters and no detergent. Here that was not the case. Visiting with other guests around the pool was also a bonus. Only negative was from our adult guests staying in the second bedroom. The twin beds are on wooden platforms and creak loudly when you move. Los Almendros is well located "
"Las instalaciones del lugar están bien, la vista de algunos cuartos está espectacular, asegúrate de cuando haces la reserva pedir uno con vista al mar, por que de lo contrarío te van a dar un cuarto sin vista y no vale la pena.

Tiene una Excelente Ubicación, a unas cuentas cuadras de la terminal y muy cerca de la plaza de Sayulita, con muchos puestos de comida alrededor, en las tardes justo enfrente venden comida.

" unas pequeñas tazas y cafetera (pero no había agua para hacer el cafe buahaha), un sofá, wifi, baño privado, tv (que por cierto nunca hicimos funcionar) y la cama no muy cómoda que digamos. No hay estacionamiento. La Zona se veía segura y tranquila, en ese aspecto no tuvimos problemas por el ruido. En pocas palabras si recibes por lo que pagas.  Solo estuvimos de paso en Sayulita, es pequeño.  Recomendable para estancias cortas."
"I took two yoga classes here, with Ita and Adrian, and they were both the best classes I've ever taken. Both instructors gave their all and incorporated asanas and techniques I've never encountered in 20+ years of yoga. I also did a by-donation sound healing with Adrian and was so moved. The facility is one out of my dreams -- airy outdoor studio in the trees where roosters and tropical birds provide the soundtrack. If I come to stay for a long period I will definitely spend a lot of time here.   The only d"
 asked for a phone call. My cousin booked her lessons elsewhere.

I’m new to yoga and decided to get a month membership while in Sayulita. I had the best experience here. All the teachers are amazing and very skilled. Being new I felt shy going in but the instructors made all levels feel welcome. I even took Jason’s power yoga class a few times and got my butt kicked but in a good way. I would highly recommend taking a class or 10 while in Sayulita. I now feel way more confident in my yoga skills and will miss this piece of heaven.
This is a beautiful space with the main yoga area upstairs amongst the trees. It’s peaceful (despite the roosters) and the teachers are amazing. I left my earrings after class and left a note for them to call me if they were found. They sent me a WhatsApp message within the hour of dropping off the note and I picked them up the next day. My good friend did YTT here was well and loved it.
"Studio mágico! I have been coming to this studio for years. Sometimes solo, sometimes with my husband and/or daughter. The enchanted garden leads to a breezy palapa. Many different styles of yoga are explored here - I’ve never had a teacher that didn’t provide a fantastic experience. A very special place built with care and love in the Sayulita spirit."
"Wonderful place, the most beautiful peaceful garden! Great yoga area with awesome yoga classes, a great variation and fully equipped. Paraiso yoga is just a lovely oasis, that feels calm and its also close to the beach and close to the centre!!"
"While I was visiting Sayulita in Feb I had wonderful experiences with full hearted yoga teachers Tanya and Henry! They brought fun and light hearted elements to class and as a yoga teacher, I even learned a few new tricks from them! They were very attentive to the students and even offered some classes in both English and Spanish! Thank you both Tanya and Henry!! 🙏🏼❤️"
"My friend and I took a morning Vinyasa class at Paraiso and absolutely loved it. The space is beautiful, and the teacher was very knowledgeable and kind. I can't wait to go again on my next visit to sayulita"
We had Enrique from Paraiso Yoga come to our villa for a private yoga class. It exceeded our expectations. Enrique taught a very thoughtful class that was both challenging and encouraging. Nara was also very communicative and accommodating during the process. I highly recommend this studio and their instructors. Thank you for the unique experience and a great way to start off our trip in Sayulita!
"First, I have to state that the staff are nice. That’s about it for the pros.  This was our worst hotel experience ever (if you can call that place an hotel). I’m shocked I booked it.  We have booked two rooms. One for the kids and one for us. The kids room had no washroom and they were expected to use a common one. We immediately upgraded to a “normal” room.   The “normal” rooms looked like monastery rooms with terrible facilities, old beds with old covers, leaking shower, we had to ask someone to get hot "
" chlorine.  Although the location is good for the day and evening, it is crazy noisy at night. The music from the nearby bar didn’t stop until 4 am (like sleeping in a bar) after that came the roosters which were unbearable even with ear plugs (like sleeping in a barn). It was a nightmare. We all didn’t sleep the whole night.  We came for one night and wanted to spend the 2nd day on the beach but were too exhausted to stay and just took the bus back to PV to our condo.   Learn from our experience, do yourse"

It was New Years week and there weren't a lot of options checking into a private room from a hostel. Luckily we found David and Hotel Las Graditas. Great location in town and had everything you need. We were budget travelers and got a great deal on our room as well as such helpful accommodations from the staff. Would definitely stay there again. Great views from the pool.
"Un increíble hotel boutique con un diseño impecable. Desde el dinamismo de los balcones en fachada, el lobby a doble altura, los acabados en concreto crudo, alternados con maderas cálidas y un excelente gusto para el mobiliario e iluminación. Un roof top con alberca, camastros y un bar increíble. Caminando de la playa, el centro y absolutamente todo lo que hay que hacer en Sayulita. Super recomendado. "
"Absolutely wonderful stay. perfect spot, a quick 5 min walk to town but away from all the noise. The place was very clean, staff was so friendly. The rooftop pool was the perfect relaxing luxurious spot !! They have cold, clean filtered water on each floor which was super helpful. Thank you to the Ximena team!"
"Excelente opción para hospedarse, la atención, el servicio del personal es increíble!! Las decoración y las instalaciones completamente nuevas, el área de la alberca está muy padre y privada. Yassem y Eker excelentes anfitriones!! Súper recomendación!!"
I booked three rooms for a night and they were all great. The location is right on the beach in the main area of Sayulita. I'd definitely book here again. The view from our room was incredible. Waking up and seeing the ocean is one of my favourite things in the world!
"I'm truly sad to write this review, as there are some great things to love about Casa Love. Xiomara who greeted us and the two women who come to clean each day are very sweet and helpful! The view from our room, Reina, was beautiful. We could wake up in the morning and watch the surfers, and watch the clouds change color in the evenings. We had a comfy couch on our patio and a hammock inside the room, so plenty of places to lounge. Also, there was hot water, contrary to another review on here. The bathrooms"
" good!  The negatives: There is no full-time front desk. This isn't a huge deal, but if you're someone who is going to have lots of questions, etc., this probably isn't the place for you. Also, make sure you email or be in touch with the staff in advance of your visit - there is a code to get in off the street and no other way to enter once you arrive. Also no guarantee staff will be there at the time you arrive.  The place had a bit of a hostel vibe - which is to say, folks would hang out in the common roo"
"I stayed at this hostel from March 7-13, 2022 as a solo traveler in the 4 bed dorm. It was comforting to stay in an all-female hostel and having the support of other women during my stay.  The dorm was a separate room off of the main 8 bed dorm. It was quiet and the bed was comfortable. There are lockers with keys provided in the room for your valuables. There is a fan in the room but no A/C, which was fine with me, as it typically cooled off during the night. There were three showers and three washrooms an"

"I absolutely LOVE staying at Casa Love or Pachamama as the head locals seem to call it whenever I'm in town. First of all the location is unprecedented - right off the beach, beside the best locs spot Aloha for chill eats & drinks, easy stroll to the plaza at night plus the nicest family owners you cold imagine. I always feel so welcome here in this beautiful artsy eclectic casa - I would give Casa Love Pachamama all of the stars in the sky if i could .... lucky they are easily stolen after Sayulita sunset "
" it was situated on a main street in a quieter area of town about 5 minutes walk from the centre of town where all of the bars and restaurants are. The hostel had a nice patio on the main floor overlooking the street with a couch, tables and swings and a small kitchen area and fridge. There was also a rooftop patio where events and yoga classes took place and it was a nice spot to relax in the sun as well. I loved the tropical trees overlooking the deck and on the stairway going up to the deck.  The Wi-Fi w"
"The good: Casa Love is literally one building away from the beach, right on the Main Street off the town square. The views are beautiful and the place is very well decorated.   The bad: After finding Casa Love and booking it, I had a few questions about the hotel, and the town. My emails were never answered. Phone calls had the same fate. When we got there, the guy who showed us to the room was either drunk or high. Not a professional look at all. Customer service was non-existent as we came and went withou"
"I booked an 'apartment' in this block through Air BnB and on arrival was shown a room far inferior to that which had been shown on the listing photos. The property on the listing had separate kitchen and sofa seating areas and outside space with table and chairs.

I pointed this out to the guy on site who spoke no English and he indicated I should contact B"
" the room, I pointed out to him, that was nothing to do with it, the simple fact was it was a completely different and far inferior property to that shown on the listing. He then tried to find me an alternative in his property portfolio - it was a room in a different building but again only one room with kitchen unit, no separate space, so I said it was not what I had booked and would need to look elsewhere.   At this point I realised I was dealing with someone dodgy and tried to ask the guy on reception to"

"Been in Sayulita a couple of times before, and this is now my favorite place to stay at. Best WIFI in town!! It’s a quiet, peaceful and picturesque place, yet centric and close to the beach.  The rooms are great! Well equipped with kitchen (big fridge), TV, SUPER COMFY bed and warm water. The pool area is just what you need to relax, and the warm jacuzzi is just what you need when you come back from surfing. Don´t forget to try the chilaquiles for breakfast!

Big thanks to martin and his staff for making my stay at ballena comfortable -  Idyllic setting near enough to the centre of all but far enough to be able to totally relax.  Breakfast was a nice touch (unusual in most Mexico properties) and the whole place spotlessly clean.  But for me the music that they play around the pool area was the best bit - never had to use my headphones once such was the quality of the playlists.  Will be back .... soon hopefully! ;)

"Booked through Airbnb, but this is a working hotel with staff. The host lied about amenities before booking and continued to do same throughout our 3 week stay, so far. Dirty upon check-in, fridge broken, 2 ceiling fans inoperable, bathroom and kitchen sinks leaking on floor, insecure doors, difficult shower doors, terrible wifi, and lack of kitchen supplies - 1 fork and 2 knives upon arrival. Host kept asking what we needed but said he referred problems to hotel. Some problems fixed after 2 weeks but still"
"The accommodations are so lovely! Super cute pool, breakfast in the morning and the rooms were really clean. It's a super close walk to town. Fit all our needs perfectly! Will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Sayulita! Martin was so kind!"
"Definitely the worst place I have ever stayed at! Upon check in I was not given access to my room because the booking was under my friend's name who had not arrived yet (although the hotel had been notified I would arrived first, room was fully paid and I offered them to take a deposit from my credit card). After 2 hours of discussing they provided me with the room which was humid, dirty and had a small bed although we had booked a Queen Size. Next to the room there was a common area w kitchen (dirty!!). At"
I really DON'T want to leave this place a good review because I want to keep it all to myself... this place was exactly what we wanted! Perfect walking distance to downtown-maybe 3-4 minutes. But yet far enough away from all the noise and craziness. Beautiful tranquil pool and small property so that it's never too crowded. Martin and his two dogs are the best and the small gym on the property was all I needed for my morning workouts. The rooms are AMAZING and come equipped with full kitchenettes so we stock
"We had the pleasure of staying here recently and we already want to go back. This place is quite a find. We were here for a family wedding, with guests staying all over Sayulita and everyone that saw our place wanted to come stay here. It is a small group of rooms (maybe 9 or 10?), so it is very intimate, while also spacious. The rooms are huge and beautiful with modern concrete floors, complete little kitchenettes and a beautiful bathroom. The pool and jacuzzi in the center of the courtyard was perfect. Ma"
" this kind of noise by other guests. The next day I went back (togehther with my friend who had made the reservation) and there was nobody at the front desk to let us in, our calls were ignored, her number was even blocked. We had paid for 4 days in total and did not stay one night. Of course we never got a refund or a call to let us know if the noise situation was solved, so we could have stayed at least 2 nights. Had to pay double and wasted lots of time trying to check in."
"This was our 4th time in Sayulita and our 4th time staying at this property. The property manager, Martin lives onsite and was initially friendly when we checked in. Our shower was having draining problems and we didn't have hot water. We alerted him to the fact that our shower was flooding our hotel room and we had no hot water, and he acted so annoyed that we woke him up at midnight. He told us the shower is not intended to be used for a long time, and there is only a limited amount of hot water per room."

" concerned with money than making guests stay comfortable. It was MLK weekend and Sayulita was packed, and we were the only guests of the hotel for the entire long weekend. They treated us like they were bothered they had to work for our stay. They constantly acted annoyed with every request we had. We had 1 guest come back to the property at 5pm, for sunset, and the guest didn't know that there was a no smoking policy. Instead of politely asking the guest to go outside, they yelled at him. They were very d"

Location is perfect, a casual 3 minute walk to the Plaza, everything close by and complete privacy and seclusion when back on a beautifully maintained property. Excellent breakfast cooked to order every morning, very difficult to leave."

"This place is awesome, 2 blocks from the beach, tons of stuff around it. the courtyard is beautiful great place to enjoy your meal and have a few bottles. There is a shared kitchen, and shared refrigerator if you want to cook and be healthy. I stayed in a private room, which was perfect, had a bed and a bathroom and a shelf. All you need. The staff is great and friendly and attentive. I stayed there for 9 days and couldn't have been happier. "
Please try your best to speak a few polite words in Spanish. These guys will watch your back.. great kitchen too. i slept in the large dorm in the back. Much cooler than the smaller front rooms.  Clean bunks. 6 burner gas stove. Professional firidge. Shop in the local markets to have dinner and invite the folks who work there to join you for a meal. it goes a long way. Everyone speaks spanish. No frat kids please. They seem to piss off the workers if you come home and make noise.. haha Enjoy
"We stayed at Lola for 3 nights before we moved into a house with friends. The staff was ok. They were able to help when our key was left overnight at a surf shop. The online reservation system did not work well. I think we booked via priceline and nobody had any idea where our reservation was. This ended up being very confusing even knowing decent spanish. If you don't know much spanish then good luck to you. We got a private room and it was pretty basic. It had a couch, bed, bath. The room was pretty big a"
 bathroom door and at least 5 real big cockroaches in the room at all times no matter how many we killed. After finding the scorpion I would have slept a lot better with a mosquito net. The bathroom was pretty old and used up. I don't think dirty is fair but I have seen better. I guess the bottom line is for $55 dollars a night I would expect more.

We loved our time in Sayulita there is so much to do and explore and a beach you can reach by walking through the jungle for 15 mins, this beach never has people on it so take a picnic and a cool box and enjoy the privacy and beauty.

"Amaia Boutique Hotel has the perfect location in Sayulita - right in the main square and less than 2 min walk from the beach.  The receptionist was incredibly sweet and friendly, we were treated with so much care and kindness. The hotel is beautiful, with a lush garden and a small heated pool, so nice! Our room was lovely and the bedsheets were the softest we have ever slept in. We also loved the smell of the conditioner. Thank you Amaia for a beautiful welcome and a great stay."
…
"Friendly and helpful staff, and a layed back atmosphere. Good prices, clean and pet-friendly. A few minutes away from the centre, and even closer to the beach, but still very peacefull and quiet at night. We have allready made our next reservation!"
"The hotel is directly underneath the Amaia club which blasts music past 3 am most nights. Sometimes people were directly above us, talking loudly, until 5 am. Even when the Amaia club was not open, nearby clubs would play music till 3 am, making it very difficult to sleep (even with earplugs/headphones). Even if you could drown out the noise, the bed would be vibrating from the music. This was not mentioned on the website. The hot water in the shower would only last for a few minutes at a time, becoming luk"
Hotel had no water for toilet or shower. We were booked for 4 nights but first night we had no water . We would have chalked it up to a temporary problem but other guests said they had no water 3 nights in a row. Two other rooms checked out in addition to us. Hotel refused to refund our payment for the 3 nights we had to stay elsewhere
"My husband and I took a weekend trip to Sayulita and stayed at Junto al Rio in one of the beachfront palapas, Mangle 2, which I would recommend. It is nothing fancy, but nicely appointed and very relaxing with the sound of the ocean waves crashing throughout the night. The facilities on site were great, too. La Isla bar offers delicious food and drinks served by very cool waiters and bartenders. We also had breakfast at the little restaurant staffed by the hippest Mexican kids in town, and in addition to am"
"Rooms right under a club with very very load music playing everyday  - impossible to sleep until the club closes at 4:00. No windows, stuffy and humid air. No refunds. Very central constant car traffic. Charming staff."
We were looking for a nice place for 2 nights and then we saw this place walking by. Fernando was so excellent and helpful and we decided to stay.  We would definitely return and this place is simple but very elegant.  Book it now. You will be happy you did.
We had a wonderful Stay at Junto Al Rio-The room which are basically Ovean Front Where very comfortable-Cleaned daily and the shower was always as Hot as required. The little basic Kitchenette was adequate for our needs of Breakfast and the odd home cooked Mahi mahi Dinner to the Fridge that worked great to keep our Beverages. The Restaurant out front which is part of Junto but open to the public as well is True Oceanfront and the service and the food was Excellent-Moses and Jenny and all the others looked 
"This resort has everything that is described.  Boutique/Prime Location/Clean/Strong Wi-fi/Cold AC/Perfect for Couples or Solo travelers.  You'll love it!  It was the service that surprised me and exceeded my expectations.  Joaquin stepped up to help me out without hesitation.  He didn't have to but was eager to assist.  He made several phone calls, translated, and worked to troubleshoot my unique situation.  I couldn't have done it without his help.  Hope to make it back soon."
"For all future travelers, I personally did have a great experience as it's written from past guests at this location, yes location is right on the beach. Which is the only positive and staff members were ok, but they also withold information act as they don't know. Upon arrival a young man Marcus made us sign a waiver stating they're not resposible for anything and everything that belongs to you (this includes your personal belongings the hotel or your rental car that allows to park, they are 0% responsible"
" were forced to carry all of our valuables at all times, since their waiver stated wouldn't guarantee to keep any of our belongings safe.  Puerto Vallarta is knowingly humid, in which we expected to have proper ventilate and screens outside etc. to keep the bugs and rodents outside. This was not the case the door & windows are made of bamboo which you are expose to noise and creepy things crawling in, (never read any of this information on their end) we only had one ceiling fan to cool the entire room, did "

After reading a few negative reviews I was actually surprised to read them.  I love this place.  The staff is very friendly both the women at the front desk and the guy who does the afternoon and the Wednesday shift (on her day off).  They are both very professional and on point.  They are very straight forward about the price and fair.  JP one of the servers at the bar we had for a few days was also very professional and friendly.  Everything about this place is to love.  I like the grounds as well.  Every
" it!   I really don’t think you will be disappointed.  You aren’t staying in a 5 star hotel, but they do a good job and the price point is very fair for Sayulita.  You get what you pay.  We had fun and extended for close to a week.  JP pictured below is the man "

"We booked this place based on the photos - we should have read the reviews.  When arriving we were greeted with an overwhelming stench of sewage.  We were told that a pipe had recently broken, but from looking at these reviews the same stench is noted back in 2017.  Not exactly recent.  The woman who checked us in was not at all welcoming and made us feel that we were interrupting her day.  Wifi did not work and we were given no answer as to why, just ""it's off"".  The room was FILTHY with sand on the floor,"
" afternoon.  After the lack of cleanliness in the rooms we were hesitant to try the food.  We do not have over the top standards, but sleeping on the beach would have been a better experience."
"Wonderful staff and location in Sayulita!  Breakfast included and wonderful rooftop pool and decks.  Rooms were very much as described, with comfortable beds and lighting. Like a lot of lodging in Sayulita, can be a very noisy place in early morning due to traffic and roosters."
"We never felt safe in this property, I was suspicious that they looked (or even tried) into my clothes and personal things.  It is terrible not to be able to trust the place you stay when you are looking for relaxing vacations. Zero problem solving.  Also, the staff never used masks or any other safety measure, they just smiled and did nothing.  Do not stay here!"
"I always research hotels before booking.  Being an experienced traveler, I understand the importance of having a relaxing hotel as your sanctuary to rest up for your next adventure.  Oz Hotel in Suyalita is superb.  Excellent location.  It is on Revolution avenue just a minutes walk from the center of town.  It's steps away from highly rated restaurants like Alquimista (best breakfast) and Aaleyah's (best shrimp tacos).  It's about a 15 minute walk to Playa De Los Muertos.  Well worth the trek.  It even has"
"The clients of my travel agency stayed only 3 nights in this inn-hotel and found it strange that some employees were in front of the doors of some rooms, in the hotel corridors. On the last day, when they went out for a walk, they decided to return right away to get more money from the safe box and saw an employee in front of their room, and then another one leaving the room, saying they were tidying up; when they opened the safe there was USD 220.00 missing, that is: employees had access to the hotel safe "
" through email directly to him, to transform the value of these daily rates into USD and return it to customers, but he never responded to emails... AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!"

"Booked a stay, they made me pay then room was under construction, they then lied and said booking was for the next night, they then extorted me for a further night. Despite booking.com stating 2 guests, they only said allowed 1. When I brought this up, the security guard and general manager tried to fight me in the lobby. This place is completely corrupt and run by the cartel. Do not stay here if you want to be safe. I had to end up leaving after the manager kept forcing his way into my room to try and make"
"This should have a better rating for Customer service alone!! Omar, Miguel and Alex were so wonderful to have around, anything we needed, they were there for us!! We loved staying here and we felt so welcomed. I can’t say enough how much we loved the customer service and stay. It’s also so very close to everything in Sayulita, no need for cabs, or Uber, you can walk everywhere from this exquisite location."
"stayed here for a week recently and it was great. The room was beautiful and they even set up a dog bed and dog water bowl since I was bringing my canine friend. The bed was firm but comfortable, shower always had hot water and the inclusive breakfast was a good touch."
"Stayed in a double hotel room. All was up to standard and service was excellent. We had to ask for additional towels as only two were provided and we were a family of 4, and they were brought to us immediately. Also, took a while for the hot water to kick in (a minute or two) but eventually it came. Breakfast was great. Made to order eggs and pancakes. I would definitely stay again."
It was really discouraging on the check out staff did not give back deposit! It makes one wonder how many visitors had been cheated like this.   When I called back to retreated the deposited - the person was not proactive to offer the solution and only said someone will call back.  Ono one did! I would strongly discourage foe people to stay there.
Really sorry to have stayed here and become a bother to one particular blonde who felt that I was acting as the most important person. Honestly I was thankful for the help to get connected with my work online. The one staff was unfriendly and self-centered most concerned with her task that did fine after my insisting to turn on the AC with so many computers and peripherals running in the tiny office at the entrance. WiFi wasn’t possible but a wired connection was necessary for the video conference for work.
"This lodging option is FANTASTIC! We loved staying here, and didn’t want to leave.   These little condominiums were perfect for our week long stay! The rooms were clean, staff was incredibly friendly and the roof top pool/patio was breathtaking. You’re able to get away from the hustle and bustle of town, but just minutes away.   We will definitely be staying here again. "
"In all the Choices of places to stay in sayulita I recommend not booking this one. I’ve stayed in sayulita 8 times and this was the worst.  They take a Deposit when you check in of 200 pesos. Cash only, no change available. The boy who checked me in did not write down that I gave a deposit so they did not give me my deposit back when I checked out. Even though everything is hand written and all the other notes said others gave deposits, because he forgot to write down that I gave a deposit they refused to g"
We stayed at Paraiso Sayulita for two weeks January 2020. Firstly I would like to say this place is excellent. This is a new boutique hotel in Sayulita. The rooms were comfortable with great AC and convenient for cooking in the kitchen. The roof top pool was an amazing place to hang out. The pool is heated and  the water inviting to go for a swim day or night. Lots of chaise lounge chairs to relax plus a pizza cooking oven on a higher roof top deck we used to make some baguettes. The staff was friendly with
 on its own so a big rock was there as a door holder which I tripped over several times.   The room smelled like mold as well.
"Great new property outside of the downtown area, on a hill about a 5 minute walk away. The rooms are simple yet functional, and everything worked. The actual bedroom area is on the smaller side, but I can't imagine travelling to Sayulita just to sit in your room all day. It was really nice to have a full fridge and a functioning kitchen. Good water pressure in the shower. AC worked very well. Pool area and terraces have great views.   We were fortunate to have the entire property to ourselves and were provi"
" visits to Sayulita as the price is excellent for what you get, especially when compared to the rest of the options in town. Do note that there are no elevators and you will need to climb stairs to the pool and terrace areas, and possibly your room. Loved the property and wish them the very best for their future."
…
"The hotel is beautiful however they need to maintain the rooms. Our penthouse suite was in need of some TLC. There were some things that were not functional and other things that were too dusty. Other than that, the hotel has a gorgeous garden, yummy food, and great customer service."
"So happy I found this place. It was the right amount out of town so away from all the noise but close enough in walking distance to do multiple times a day like I did. Staff were amazing, Salvador was such a help! The pool was great, breakfast was included and there was also a little kitchen in my room. Own private bathroom and hot water. There was an upstairs yoga studio room which was a great space I had to myself each day. Somethings could use an upkeep (minor Esthetics had no issue in functionality). Hi"
"Friendly staff and owners.   Very comfortable, small hotel that is clean and very well taken care of and in a less hectic side of Sayulita.   Loved the breakfast every morning - YiYo made the morning along with the Los Patos (ducks)."
Very settled place was just frustrating not having a solid wifi reception. Staff available and friendly. Was away from the hustle and bustle of Sayulita but within walking distance of the shops and restrarants.
"Would like to share details of our attempt to stay in Villas Sayulita. We booked hotel 1 and a half months ahead and paid 1/2 of the total $ 4,500.00(mex) for 3 nights stay. We checked in at 3 pm, we were asked to pay another half of our total which were $ 2,250.00(mex) We were also asked to put $350 damage deposit . We went to our room and find it dirty starting from the lots of hair in the sink to dirty bedding. We asked to give us clean room but they said we need to wait for the cleaning staff to clean i"
"We came here for a long weekend. Great location and friendly vibe and great service. Good prices. We could hear the DJ party down the beach on Friday night. But nothing that a few margaritas couldn’t take care of. Surfboard rentals at multiple spots next to hotel although quality of equipment is well used. If you love to eat tacos, surf and have a few drinks this is a great place. I would come back for sure."
Arrived here yesterday and was immediately charmed by our host Gustavo and our room. Incredibly friendly service from all the staff.  Our ocean front room was clean with a high ceiling and a lovely open floor plan. You can shower while taking in a view of the ocean.  Are you in love with the hotel yet? You will be after you sleep on their incredibly firm and comfortable mattress. Beach chairs provided by the hotel. I’ve heard the restaurant is fantastic. And the location ? The center of town is a flip-flop 
This place has a good impression they  greed you as soon as walk in . Very helpful as me and my couple decided to walk the town for a few we headed back to our room early so around 1230 am one of there employees of the hotel unlocks our door with his keys and walks in our room.as we were asleep my wife yelled and he said I didn’t you were in here and ran off as I went to the door he disappeared  I’ve called there reception the lady said if you don’t like leave this is some very sneaky stuff going on here  n
 I’ve give you the  person in charge number call him. It’s not save they could take your belongings or even hurts us as we stay there.

"Location is amazing - right on the beach, with free beach chairs, in the middle of all the action. Service was friendly and attentive, food and drinks were delicious.  I had an ocean view room and the terrace and view were amazing! Air conditioning was awesome. The building is showing wear and tear so furnishings are quite old and worn out but I wasn't expecting a luxurious stay for the price. Room was comfortable. Value was good for a busy beach town.   The only thing that bothered me was the smell - the r"

"We hosted our destination wedding in Sayulita  in March 2021. The week started with our bachelor/bachelorette parties. The Bachelor party dinner was held here at MAR with the help from Gus hosting the private dinner. He went above and beyond to make sure the guys had an amazing night.   The day after the wedding we hosted a Beach Party at MAR with the help from Gus again. We rented all the tables/chairs/umbrellas in front of the restaurant where our guests could come hang out, have a cocktail and bar food, "
Excellent experience. Perfect location. Bohemian just like advertised. Excellent service  This is located right on the beach. Likely the hotel with the best location in sayulita  Decorated as bohemian which is suitable for this bohemian surfer town. 2 min walk to town square and all the action at night as well. It is rustic and bohemian just as advertised with nice garden in back and roof top bar. Staff were excellent.   Andres was host who took care of me and he was amazing. Best host i have had in many ye
"These are palapa style accommodations in the jungle a very long walk from town. That means open air for bugs, spiders etc. Luckily they have very effective netting over the beds. These have beautiful views and a great place to sit and watch the beautiful bay. The palapa themselves are in need of upkeep. Our front door was very hard to slide open. The folding door on the balcony was missing hardware so it didn’t lock. Big bathroom and closet area which was good, but no coffee maker. The walk is long, unless "
" a nice gesture. The free continental breakfast is good and their coffee is great. If you do an add-on of chiliqules, be warned that they charge 250 pesos for it. Beer and lemonade at the bar was charged at 100 pesos per drink at checkout. This was twice the price at the nicest restaurants in Guadalajara or PV. My bad for not asking I guess 🤷‍♂️. The pool area is quaint and scenic. The railing has large gaps (3ft wide) where the railing has rotted and been removed but not replaced.   If you go in eyes wide "
"Let’s start with the good! This hotel is absolutely beautiful! It is very modern with a super cool aesthetic and amazing rooftop patio. It is located right in the center of Sayulita, near restaurants, bars, and the beach. The breakfasts were solid and the staff was super helpful!   Having said all that, this hotel was very, very loud at all hours of the day. Our room was just below the rooftop bar and the music was cranking ALL DAY and well into the night. I understand that they can’t control the noise that"

Unfortunately this was absolutely not true, the room had no proper balcony monks and was in a run down condition. They just have been super respectless.

"The only complaint is that we didn’t stay longer! We loved everything about this place. The decor, the location, everything was amazing! Aaron was super responsive and made our trip that much better. It’s a short walk to everywhere you need to go.  We will definitely be back!"
"My friend and I recently stayed at the Sayulinda and had a wonderful time. The rooftop was amazing with friendly staff, great drinks, and comfortable hammocks and beds to relax. I enjoyed live music and a drink at sunset with a beautiful view of the ocean. If you're staying in Sayulita, this is a great central location."
"First of all, I might have given this property a higher score had it not been for the fact that on the first night all of our cash and jewelry was stolen. Security should be the highest priority and unfortunately this property lacks adequate staff presence to protect guest rooms from entry.   A hole in the fence and folding doors on the balcony provide easy access. Conveniently, there was no camera with a view of the far side of the property leaving the Master Suite completely vulnerable to entry via the ba"
"All the reviews for this place are 100% accurate.   Aaron was a very helpful and responsive host.   Cannot beat the location.   Even tho the town was bustling and busy, the unit could be sealed tight so no outside noise came in.  Add the black out blinds and the result was an epic nights sleep.   Furniture was cozy.  Place was very clean. Kitchen was stocked.   Pool and our patio was amazing.   The YahYah cafe was conveniently located right out front so great breakfast awaited us every morning.   We stayed "
"This is not a fancy hotel but is quite adequate although you want a room with a view of the square. The location is excellent, rooms are clean, and it is a good value. Just what I expected.  The restaurant is good but we ate at lots of different places. We really like this small town"
"Cannot recommend this place enough, for a host of reasons. The location, the pool, the rooms, the free (& yummy) breakfast, the proximity to the beach. But the best feature of all is the staff. We had a small issue with our room and they graciously moved us to a different one on one of the busiest weekends of the year. Thank you Sooooo much Cynthia!   One thing to note: if you are a very light sleeper, or have young kids, might not be the best hotel as it can be a little noisy at night - but when you book a"
" members of staff had conspired with the rats, but only the police report and phone records will tell us for sure. The fact that we had just arrived and left the room for only 2 hours means that either the rats are constantly watching or they were notified of the opportunity.  Sadly, I now appreciate that many of the other sub-par reviews on Google were accurate and that Customer Service, menu options, and management are mostly lacking. I will repeat what others have said, I really wanted to love this place"
Great location.  Very clean. Wonderful staff. Nina was always helpful. Good continental breakfast included.  Our room #8 was very small 1 double bed.. try for a bigger room.  Very nice common areas and a pool.
"Casa Makawe was excellent. Comfortable, quiet, yet only a couple minutes walk from the square. The units facing the street (larger units) are on each floor separated from one another by a hallway, so no adjacent walls. Also, Aaron the manager/contact person was always responsive to questions, communicated clearly, and great to work with (especially nice if it's your first time to Salulita).   Full recommendation!"
"We loved our time at Casa Makawe! Aaron and the team were very accommodating and made sure we had a great stay. We stayed in one of the Queen Studios for the first part of our stay and loved the simplicity of the room and added kitchen area for making coffee, breakfast, etc. The room was a little dark, but it was one of the ones facing the back and on the plus side was incredibly quiet even though we were there over the busy and loud New Years holiday. We extended our stay and moved to one of the King Studi"
"Hotel Tajin is conveniently located, right off the square and near the church courtyard where the voladores perform.   We stayed in the cheapest room on the main floor (which may have been a mistake) for 2 nights. King sized comfortable bed, AC, 1 bottle of water provided per day, lots of hot water, good wifi. The room showed lots of wear and tear, felt very humid  and was in need of an update. Being an old room, power outlets we high on the wall, making it difficult to charge our phone.  There must be nice"
"Absolutely love it! Location is perfect, rooms are nice, rooftop pool and bar are super cool. I have been here 3 times and will continue to visit! Ideal for couples or groups of friends. They don’t have a restaurant but waiters will order food from great places around if you are in the pool area for a quick snack. They also have live music on the weekends."

Beautiful place and super clean. Just stayed one night. Just outside the gate you can view the ocean. Comfortable bed with lots of pillows. There is a communal refrigerator to store your drinks. The staff made it 5 stars.
"My wife and I stayed here 2 years ago before COVID.  It was so nice we came back again.  The place is exceptional.  Nothing fancy, yet very reasonably priced rooms only a block from the beach.  An easy bus ride from the airport, just walk across the bridge and catch a Compostella bus to Sayulita.  50 pesos.  It drops you off literally around the corner and a 5 minute walk away.  A lot of the downstairs rooms are small and spartan, no TV, microwave or fridge.  Yet reasonable.  There is a nice upstairs terrac"
"We had the top floor lofted apartment at Casa Makawe and we loved it. The loft is approx 850 sf with 180 degree views of the town and hills of sayulita, private balconies and an indoor / outdoor vibe with sliding doors that open up all the way. We both worked from the apartment and didn't feel like we were missing out on anything because the apartment gave us incredible light, bird song, views, and breezes. The wifi is excellent - no issues and easy to do any type of downloads etc. The rooftop infinity pool"
"The price didn't suggest luxury but the Tajin was very satisfactory with a comfortable, spacious room.  My room, being at the front of the building, offered a considerable view of the street life, with a distant view of a traditional ceremony (although the voladores might be out of reach).  The hotel staff were courteous.  Breakfast was not included in the price but what was available was more than enough; dinners were decent too.  With a small choice of accommodation in Papantla, I see no reason to stay an"
"The hotel is nice enough, if you were paying $100.  Regrettably our room was more like $250, but you could see the ocean a couple of blocks away.  The rooftop bar and pool are nice, but the pool was too cold and our margarita and bloody mary were $320 pesos, about $16.  It was close to the beach and the main square, so the location was good.  Unfortunately, there are a couple of music clubs on the corner that thumped the techno/disco all-night-long.  There was no way to shut it out.  We should have known so"
"Thank you Siete Lunas!  We decided to take a trip to Sayulita and stayed the second week of February, which was a bit cold for my liking but it was still delightful and romantic. From the start of my reservation, Alejandro and Arturo made sure my request were made and kept me informed at all times, they also made arrangements for a driver to pick us up from the Puerto Vallarta airport (at an additional cost). We arrived to the hotel and was greeted by Alejandro and Arturo with a couple of margaritas for us,"
 area.  Nice refreshing pool in the courtyard.  And clean.... they and their staff appear to be cleaning all day every day.  The place is spotless.  It is one of the few places in Sayulita you can actually use and practice your Spanish.  They do not speak much English at all yet they really try hard to communicate in such a way that the differences are minimal.  I cannot really recommend this place high enough.  It is a hotel that lets you feel as if you are experiencing Mexico while in Sayulita.  Very safe
The staff was VERY nice. We arrived early and left late and they were very accommodating. Hotel was close enough to the action and beach without being right on top of it. The pool in the middle of the hotel was AWESOME!!!! We could watch our kids swim right from our hotel room. The kitchenette saved us a lot of money from eating out every meal.
"We stayed at CasaMakawe for a full month and couldn’t be happier. My partner and I had been traveling for a couple months, and casamakawe was the perfect place to enjoy sayulita and soak up Mexico. Modern vibes, great room, roof top and pool vibes- we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. 10/10"
"We spent 5 days at casa makawe, and enjoyed every minute! The rooms are very comfortable with everything you would need.  It has a great location, under 5 minutes walk to get anywhere but it is just far enough to not hear all the amazing party spots bumpin at night. The pool was wonderful to relax in during the day and the bar had many games to play with other members staying in the building!  Highly recommend staying here! Aaron was a great host!"
"If you are looking for a clean, friendly hotel, with comfortable beds and a great location,  you have come to the right place!  This is not a hotel for people who expect first class accommodations.  There is no elevator (although there are people to carry your bags, if necessary), and the rooms have no safe, nor are the furnishings elegant, but this is a very clean, relaxing, pleasant place to relax after a day seeing the sights of Tajin and the darling town of Papantla.  There are verandas on each floor, a"

"Hotel Diamanté is a great economy stay on the north end of Sayulita. Only one block to the beach, and with a great pool to float or read in. Rooms are simple, clean and comfortable. The hotel felt very safe and I appreciated seeing the hotel owner Theresa every day.  Basic breakfast and coffee offered every morning (but one of the best breakfast cafes is right next door). I wish they had in-room safes but otherwise my stay was great. As a female solo traveler, it’s important that I’m safe and comfortable an"
"I would stay here again! Gorgeous decor throughout the hotel and guest rooms. The pool is beautiful. The back lawn and patio are lovely. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Very clean and well kept. The rooms are very spacious and include a kitchenette. The bed was very comfy, as well."
"My family stayed here and were very impressed with the hotel and staff! The rooms and property were very clean and tidy. The hotel is the perfect distance from the downtown area and the beach, only 5 minutes walking. I would strongly reccommend anyone coming to sayulita to stay here! I can’t say enough about how great the staff was in accommodating us! Stay at the Riviera Sayulita Hotel!"
"Perfect location just a short walk to the town which has many restaurants and bars. The rooms are modern with working and effective air conditioning. The kitchenette is well equipped should you wish to do some cooking of your own. Parking is available but limited. At the time of our visit the parking area was under construction. Should be available soon. Host is very friendly, speaks English and is always available. Rooftop pool is very inviting overlooking the town. Perfect for that evening sundowner. Ther"
"A modern, newly built place. Super clean and spacious. Great location, a 5 minute walk to the main square or to the beach, yet far away enough from the noise of the bars.  Room had  a nice king size bed and Large shower which was nice after a day at the Beach.  Air conditioner worked great and the hammock in the room was a nice touch. Enjoyed the balcony in the evening before heading out. I would definitely stay here  again. "

The kitchen is no longer available to prepare your own meals, but the hotel provides a minimal breakfast: sweet loaves from Costco, fresh fruit, yogurt w/ sugary cereal for garnish and coffee from an ancient percolator! All sugar and mediocre coffee. The upstairs kitchens are closed and the outside sitting areas are open to smokers, so bad luck for you if guests in the adjacent rooms are smokers.

"This is a nice hostel in the middle of town. But after staying at the nearby Viajero Hostel this place just can’t compare. Viajero is bright, airy, & cleaner w/ good looking people, vibes, & insane views. The beautiful atmosphere at Viajero makes people immediately open up and befriend you. They have an indoor coworking space that doesn’t have windows but you are able to work outside. I stayed at Viajero Hostel & made the terrible mistake of switching & booking to Selina. Again, Selina is nice but in no way"
Aaron was very responsive and quick to reply to any questions we had. The roof top pool is a great lounging area. Location is perfect for access to beaches and the activity of town. Nice modern units with fully equipped kitchen. Note there is no oven. Gas cook top only. Filtered water as well.
" Probably in all rooms since there are multiple routers on every floor. This is a big plus for me. View from the room is the pool. Also you can see the Voladore statue on top of the mountain just out of your window.  The shower head needs to be replaced but the pressure is very good so showers are fine. Plenty of hot water. Amenities are perfect, there is even a movable round mirror with 2 different mirror magnification. Shampoo, body cream and soap are supplied. There is a hair dryer. There should be a bet"
"This hotel is nice, the rooms are just fine. The rooftop pool and bar area are really cool and nice. My biggest complaint is that they allow people from the public to use the bar/pool area and it can get pretty rowdy. They also claim to close the bar at 10 but they definitely keep it open and with loud music much later than that. The hotel itself and the pool/bar area aren't that big, so by letting others up it makes the space limited and you have to kind of fight to get one of the just 4 cabanas that are a"
" still spotlessly clean, the managers are friendly, and the dipping pool w/ fountain is relaxing and refreshing."
"Despite being beautiful, new and clean, it is not for those who want tranquility or for those who need to work. Loud music (from the hotel's own bar) playing throughout the night, every night (at least in high season, February, it was like that). Also, the services are not very professional for a hotel of this price. The fan in my room didn't work, and a person at the front desk confessed that the hotel already knew about the problem beforehand. I hate air conditioning and I spent two nights without the fan"
…
"Reading other reviews it sounds like the hotel has had some needed upgrades.  Our bed was excellent and huge (we requested a King).  The room was #63 and called a Junior Suite, but was just a room, possibly larger than a standard.  The room looks out over the street and main plaza.  There was always music playing outside during the day,  but it quieted down completely at night. Someone wrote that Hotel Tajin is a few blocks from the central plaza; it is actually a half a block away.  Driving into Papantla? "
…
"Our stay at Hotel Diamante was cozy, and personal with hotel staff (Theresa who runs the place).  Except for the second night when I was awakened by the neighbors in the next room, which were laughing and having a great time at around 1 am.  I had to turn on the A/C and ceiling fan to make some drowning noises.  The following day a complained to Theresa and she said they were checking out that day, and told my I should of knocked on their door.  Later that day, I found out who was in that room and it was on"
"I booked The Loft for a week, the room was great, amazing bed, good A/C (you need this during summer) and staff was lovely. But it's noisy, within the hotel guests and location. Centrally located, which is good for moving around town, but not that friendly when you want to sleep. Lovely yoga classes offered in the rooftop. Good restaurant in site, not very vegetarian friendlyl."
This hotel is in a great location  - just a few blocks from the central square and cathedral - and an excellent view of Papantla. The room was clean and comfortable. The food in the hotel's restaurant was the best I had in Mexico.
"Selina is a great spot to stay!  We stayed for 4 nights in September 2020 and had a great time!  The room was clean and comfy and the facilities are great, the pool is a nice area to hang out!  The wifi is unreliable here but that's not Selina's fault - the whole town has unreliable wifi!  Would definitely recommend this place and would stay again!"
A quaint hotel located in the heart of the central district! Would definitely stay again. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 is because the towels were really hard and scratchy  Need to use suavatel😉 Breakfast was included... huevos rancheros Were excellent as well as the coffee! 2 really nice restaurants to choose from to eat. We did have a slight problem locating the hotel as it is on a hill and the parking was at the bottom of it. Loved the town especially  On Sunday!!!!
"This wonderful hotel was Luke a little sanctuary of luxury. The pool was fantastic, the rooms spacious and so clean, bathroom was large and clean. The staff are all welcoming, happy and wonderful. The hotel is central to everything in town and to the beach. It’s a little gem in the middle of Sayulita. No negatives about it. It was really special. "
We loved the central location of the Kupuri and were pleasantly surprised by how peaceful and quiet it was. Our ground floor room looked out on the pool. The rooftop breakfast spot gave excellent views of the city and ocean. Staff were very helpful. The hotel was sparkling clean. 
"I stayed here for 5 nights recently. The hotel is exactly what it appears to be. Affordable. Kind of comfortable (plastic-covered hard mattresses and bad pillows) but fairly clean. The rooms are very basic but the bathrooms are newly renovated and quite nice. The pool area was also kept clean and swept and was a pleasant gathering spot for our group.   The WiFi worked great and when the power went off due to a storm, the hotel quickly fired up the generator.   The provided breakfast is barely that and presi"
" on the street which gives you some measure of security. There is also a security guard in the central pool area all night. He chain smokes (which drifts up to your room) and plays Mexican dance music on his little boom box (which is a drum throb in your room). But honestly, Sayulita is a party town and doesn’t shut down early at night. Don’t go to Sayulita if you want quiet.   The maids were great and if you tipped, your room got extra attention. The front desk staff (Monica) has ZERO people skills. If you"

"We recently had a wedding in Mexico and the entire wedding party stayed at this hotel in Sayulita. The hotel was absolutely perfect! It had every amenity one could need for a small town in Mexico.   Obviously, time in room was minimal as Sayulita is an incredible city to explore. Time spent in room was just as expected for a small town in Mexico...working air conditioning [lifesaving], private bathrooms, gorgeous and spacious showers, comfy bed and clean sheets.   The staff of hotel was more than accommodat"
"We’ve been a couple of days here. We got Del Mar Villa and everything was awesome. The room is front beach, air condition, espacios shower, small living area, kitchen area… and the most spectacular… an awesome terrace where you can sit, take a coffe and see the sunrise.   You can order room service or go down to eat something at the restaurant. It could be for breakfast, dinner or lunch. A quick option to have a meal.  It’s a walking distance from downtown… almost 3 minutes, but that’s great because you res"
"First, the grounds are gorgeous and each room is so unique and beautiful. You honestly can’t go wrong. HOWEVER, the stairs are no joke!!! We were lucky and stayed in the Cascadas room which was right near the pool and the front of the hotel and restaurant. A lot of other people in our party had to basically climb a mountain to get to their room.   The staff was fantastic. From the front desk to house keeping, everyone was welcoming and friendly. Ivan and Fran at the bar were our favorites though. They alway"
"Overall I’d give this stay 3.5 Stars. The view was top notch, the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating but a few things caused our stay to be less amazing than expected. We were excited to be able to book a last minute trip to Sayulita and stay in the Mi Amor Villa which boasts a beautiful view of the beach, a private balcony with an outdoor tub overlooking the ocean. The website does state that you must climb stairs to reach this room/view. Being healthy and fairly fit we underestimated the inco"
 again.  It really isn’t a huge deal if you plan on staying in your room for the whole trip. We were excited to go swimming at the beach and into town for breakfast and dinner but that had us traipsing up and down those stairs 4x a day and it wasn’t fun. It was daunting and exhausting. To top it all off the week we were in Sayulita was over crowded and excessively noisy. The town was filled to the brim with partygoers celebrating the Holy Week of Easter. Mi Amor villa has zero soundproofing. Expect to be ab

"This is a tough review to write because the experience here has been so uneven. Ricardo at the front desk is fantastic, while his colleague Judy is rude and unpleasant. Some of the rooms are fabulous with amazing views, while others have beds that are so soft it's like you're falling into a waterbed. Bonus: we had one room that had a broken pipe in the ceiling above and water was dripping on our faces the entire night. While they upgraded us to a better room - which is the default when there is a dangerous "

"Great location/staff. Some Villas in better condition than others. On site restaurant and bar convenient, but expensive. Poor value for price. Once you get past the initial “wow”-this emperor has few clothes."
"Don’t stop on this one. When renting a “Villa” one expects a few amenities such as some artwork on the walls, clean sheets, a plug close to your bed, and a full kitchen. One does not expect dirty sheets, one tall glass in the kitchen, a small blender, no placemats , no platters, aweful coffee and cups for your coffee one would see at a motel six. The place has zero charm. The owners clearly want your money but do not wish to expend anything above and beyond.  There are also only two lounge chairs for the tw"
A place to meet really lovely people in the best location in Sayulita—less than 5 min walk from the beach and plaza yet far enough away that you can’t hear the all-night parties going on. Can’t wait to return.
"Wish I could leave a zero star review. Stayed here with my girlfriend in one of the private rooms, room was good just didn't get cleaned during our 3 day stay. Never given a towel on check in, got it at 11pm when we came back from dinner and a few drinks. Was never given the WiFi code which didn't matter as it was non existent in our room.  The worse came on the morning of check out, the owner came and woke us up at 9am saying to come to reception to pay even though we paid online and had confirmation of th"
"We just returned from one of our best vacations ever. The Estates were fabulous, but the people made it truly a wonderful experience  Rudy our Butler attended to our every need quickly and efficiently, and was a pleasure to get to know. Our concierges Juan and Emmanuel were always there for us too. Having What’s App to communicate with everyone was a great tool, and worked well. The drivers Daniel, Alejandro , Sebastián , Roberto and all the others were always there to take us wherever we wanted to go. Also"

This is my second time at Amazing hostel. I stayed at other hostels before but I knew exactly where to go when I needed someplace quiet to relax away but still walking distance from the beach. The atmosphere is is great! I've met so many friends here. The rooms are always clean. The restrooms are always clean. And showers with hot or cold water. The volunteers are above excellence. They really care about their work. And are always there if you need anything. The Owners Suzy and her husband Anhuar are super

 Suzy. I stayed at the Amazing for one whole month and took a month course with Suzy she is such a great teacher. Very attentive to start you off slowly step by step to learn everything correctly and formally. I would like to thank them for the month that I was there. I felt very like it was home away from home and that feeling is hard to come by when traveling.

We were always greeted with a sincere smile everywhere we went from every staff member. The pools are gorgeous!

A wonderful experience once again.  This time I stayed for 33 days.  It was nice to see the same staff that were there on my previous visits.  The staff are always helpful and attentive.  I’ll be back again for sure.
Wonderful boutique hotel that accommodated our entire extended family for two nights.  Staff was extremely helpful and the breakfast was delicious!  Our room was very large and had more than enough space for a family of four (including toddler and infant).   
Penthousito  We were a party of three and they were sold out of suites we found a little trick ! There is a room called penthousito that actually has two  trundle beds! We we were able to pay 30 usd more and get that room which didn’t have a river view but did have enough rooms for us
Magni Fic! Escaping the cold of Montreal we made the best choice that was possible!! This is a little castle with so much art and a wonderful vibes. I wanted to take the whole place home and decorate my house with everything!
"Walkable to all the quaint cobblestone streets-eating, shopping, margaritas, art, church, hike, and Malecon Boardwalk. Escape from it all behind secure gates. The hotel is a true retreat! There are many places to unwind - balcony, terrace near river, pool with bar, kitchenette, reading room. The Gretel Room is eclectic, clean, and welcoming. You can even walk to the sister property's scenic rooftop pool and bar to be treated like a special guest. Breakfast and happy hours are a must! We have no regrets abou"
"Great hotel, Marta and Itzel were efficient and helpful. We  were trying to get a room assignment for a room under three nights, the thing that I didn’t know Is that all of the rooms are wonderful and comfortable. We hope next time we can stay longer."
"A five minute walk from the louder downtown area of Sayulita,  which makes it perfect.  Clean rooms with full kitchens.  Great courtyard with a pool that is perfect for families.  Reasonably priced with helpful staff.  We’ve been to Sayulita several times and definitely recommend El Pueblito."
"Very friendly staff who greet you with smiles, who are helpful, accommodating and informative about the area and guest needs/requests. Very clean and kept hotel with unique rooms and comfortable bedding. Breakfast was fantastic with fresh prepped fruit and more. The view of the river is nice even though the location is busy and bustling: close the windows and it all disappears. Thank you much for a great stay and look forward to next trip!"
"Our goal was simply to choose a place to stay in the middle of Sayulita. We didn’t set very high expectations. El Pueblito Sayulita exceeded expectations. It’s like a small community in the hotel- everyone eats an awesome breakfast from their amazing staff and then hangs out by the pool throughout the day. The rooms are like mini two story condos. The big surprise was the staff’s ability to handle concierge-like requests. Amparo at the front desk was amazing - she scheduled boat trips, rides, ziplines. She "
"This little boutique hotel is a hidden gem! The location is perfect, in Zona Romantica along the river, close enough to all the action but distant enough to enjoy some peace and quiet. The hotel is full of character, the rooms were clean, the price was good, and the service was great! We highly recommend this place for a nice getaway."
"We stayed for a couple of nights and would have liked to have stayed longer except it was fully booked.  Very lucky we had the spacious and beautiful room 109 with 2 terraces (one for the bathroom!) - we absolutely loved it. There was also the lovely sitting and dining areas, rooftop pool and terrace which we enjoyed. Logan the manager greeted us so warmly he made us feel right at home at once, answering our queries with recommendations and suggestions.  We were well looked after throughout our stay by Ale "
"This is a totally adequate hotel but be sure to confirm what you booked when you arrive, as it felt like they deliberately tried to scam us. We booked a Master Suite Premium online (2 floors, 2 bedrooms, kitchen, balcony w/ view of pool)  but when we were arrived we were put in the worst room in the hotel: last room on the bottom floor, dark, behind the bar, next to storage closet, no view, no wifi, shower didn't work properly and a light from hallway shone into the room all night.  When we asked why we wer"

" afternoon and we moved to the correct room which was a huge improvement, plenty of space. We asked for a refund for the difference in room price and again were told someone would refund us the following day. This continued our whole stay and we were never given a refund, which is why I am giving a lower rating.  That being said the location was excellent, easy walking distance to everything. The breakfast was decent, we only ate there once. The suite is the way to go, nice to have the balcony and 2 bathroo"

So a few months ago we were at a property near Playa Del Carmen for the 8th time. We ran into a couple and mentioned that we had a family trip and May and we looking for a new spot. They mentioned Casa Da Mita and immediately texted Marc( owner). Marc was great helping with dates and we booked 4 rooms in May. My wife and I decided we need to do a reconnaissance mission to make sure we liked the place. The kids laughed and called BS.  So everyone starts their review with I am cautious to write this review as
"My wife and I spent the last 8 days at El Pueblito Sayulita.  I highly recommend this hotel for the following reasons: value, rooms, restaurant/bar, service and location.  All of the service was fantastic including Patricio, Amparo but especially Jonathon who served us breakfast every morning by the beautiful pool and rented us a golf cart we used to cruise around town and adventure through the jungle.  The location is perfect as it is a 5min walk to the plaza and near north beach which is less crowded & le"

The rooms all have spectacular view and are kept immaculate .

The meals were amazing  and the atmosphere was inviting, friendly and so relaxing. I highly recommend this place and will be returning in 2023 for another stay!"
"We stayed here one night last week before checking into another hotel in a different part of town.  OMG.  One must go to experience the beauty of this place.  Many other reviews have lauded the open areas, the custom breakfast, the helpful manager Logan, the hop, skip, and funicular down to the vibrant downtown area.  Because of a cancellation, we were offered  (and took) the heavily favored room #19, and it did not disappoint.   We could not have asked for a better experience."

Full disclosure this was one of the most expensive places we have been in Mexico but I think is well worth the price.

"My husband and I just returned from our annual visit to Casa de los Arcos.  We love it there so much that we consider it our second home.  We stay in the casita called La Palapa: so called because of the palapa roofs on it.   With the exception of the air-conditioned bedroom and the bathroom, the rest of the casita is open to the delightful weather of Puerto Vallarta.  (Of course, the rooms have roofs).  We've visited Casa de los Arcos different times of the year, and it is never too hot.  It is built high-"
"Hacienda Mosaico is a very special place in a quiet Puerto Vallarta neighborhood.  It has all the comforts of a B&B and more.  You are surrounded by magnificent mosaics and colorful, whimsical art.  The food is excellent, the proprietors are friendly and helpful when you need information and travel guidance.  The pool is splendid. It is just a magical retreat.  They also conduct great workshops throughout the year.  It is a fabulous place to relax and renew."
"I'm finishing up my third stay at Villa Lola in the last 13 months so that should sum up how I feel about the place! I have stayed in four different rooms and they are all lovely and inviting but they are all different and unique in their own way with stunning decor from local artists. My visits have been both as a guest when others are staying and it operates as a boutique hotel and twice as the leader of a private group to buy out the entire property for 5-6 nights. Logan, the manager, is absolutely a dre"

The very kind and accommodating folks that make the experience so special treat you as their newest old friends.

They are all great and accurate adjectives but not even all together can they begin to describe the way guests feel about Casa de Mita. You wa"

The location is close enough to take a short walk to any restaurant in town yet far enough from the hubbub in the evening to be quiet.   It is so close to being a great property, but the cold hot tub and unheated pool make it prettier to look at than to use. More importantly, the furniture is right down uncomfortable. Th"

 makes you feel like you are part of the family and the way the villa is set up works extremely well for groups with plenty of seating areas (and is super COVID friendly with all the public areas being open air). All the guests I've had for my private group trips have absolutely fallen in love with all things Villa Lola and the neighborhood (Zona Romantica). You cannot do any better than staying here and I am always incredibly sad to leave and eager to come back. The staff and the owners' pride in the place
" Huerta Contreras the team are all rock stars including Lalo, Memo, Manuel, Carlos and Dylan. Literally every single person on staff deserves kudos. And as a bonus they even have an extraordinary stylist that can give great cuts and color to women and men all with her trademark French flair.

Spent a week there in April 2022 in the casita called La Palapa which is mostly outdoor (with the exception of the bedroom and bathroom which may be air conditioned).  Susan and David are excellent hosts who certainly attempt to meet your every need.  To wake up every morning and look out on Bahia de Banderas is not to be missed.  It is certainly a little piece of Heaven.

"It was wonderful to come back to Casa Yvonneka and see the staff, relax by the pool, laugh with friends, and eat some awesome Mexican meals by Malena.  The staff is more than their role they have become family/friends as we look forward to seeing them, as much as staying at the beautiful home.    The rooms are beautiful, unique, spacious and the layout of the home provides as much privacy as you need when you stay with 14 other people. A gem in Zona Romantica."
" family. They truly make the experience.   Some additional thoughts, in no particular organization: - The food is really good. Wide range of options at each meal, and the kitchen is very accommodating if say you can’t choose between two dinner options and they make you a mixed plate of both.  - The drinks are perfect. Go with the staff recommendation wherever you can — they make some excellent original house cocktails.  - There are some attractions nearby like the town of Sayulita and Punta Mita just to the"

Susan and David are the kindest, most welcoming hosts, who are on the premises and offer the best suggestions PVR has to offer. Susan purchased groceries for us, made reservations for restaurants/taxis and even our covid tests to return back home. There are multiple terraces + gardens to enjoy, their animals are super sweet and make guest appearances, and the pool was lovely to hang out at in between naps "
"Hacienda Mosaico offered us a truly amazing get-away for 5 days during which we were students in a mosaic art class with teacher, Bonnie Fitzgerald from Maverick Mosaics, in Virginia.  If art enriches your life, this is the place for you!  In every nook and cranny, you will discover absolutely incredible works of art, in many different mediums.  Some were created by Sandra, aka Sam, the owner of this one-of-a kind treasure, while others were created by artist-teachers who have held classes here and perhaps "
" still available on either side).  The Casa is located within a 10 minute walk of the old town, so easily accesible. We can't wait to return!!"
"This is our second time at Casas de Los Arcos. That in itself should say something. My wife and I love this place. Situated on the hillside, it is overlooking the Basilio and the Romántico Zona. Yes!!!! Great view of the bay. Night time views are breathtaking.   Rooms are fully equipped with kitchenette. Although not a recent construction the Casas gorgeous and impeccably maintained.  Hot tub, pool and decks are relaxing and picturesque.   Its a quiet out of the way place for you to withdraw from the noise "
"Last month I had the great pleasure of staying at Cinetica with my son. We had planned a trip to Nuevo Vallarta and decided to extend our stay and explore Sayulita for a few days. We expected great waves and a great vibe (we've heard about Sayulita for years), but we did not expect to find such a unique and wonderful home base for our Sayulita adventure. The property is exceptional. Tucked into the jungle hillside Cinetica is envelopes you in nature and tranquility. Our suite was quite close to others, but "
…
" gracious with my young son and made a lasting impression (he talks about wanting to go back to Cinetica almost daily). Pros: + Off the beaten path (quiet and secluded) + Beautiful, spacious suites + Lush jungle setting + Easy access to amazing beaches  Cons: - Limited dining options. We cooked in our suite, and it worked out very well. Just know that you will not be walking to the taqueria  I can't wait to visit Cinetica again!"
"Casa Yvonneka was my home for 6 days to celebrate a milestone birthday and brought along 12 best friends of mine. On arrival, the house FAR exceeded any of my expectations. Absolutely breath taking and incredibly massive. There were places in the house I didn’t even see it was so big. People were getting lost finding their way back to their rooms through the 8 floors.  And The views alone could make you cry.   While reading a lot of these reviews before coming here, every single one of them mentions the inc"
"The grounds are immaculate.  The rooms comfortable, the view stunning, the service spectacular and the food is the best food there is for an all inclusive and I have been to a lot of AI.s.    The food and grounds is better than Marival Distinct Luxury Residences (and that is a good resort).  The food is better than Velas Vallarta (also a very good resort but only 2 restaurants).  The best restaurant for us was Friba and the Asian one.  The Italian place had a mushroom soup on the menu to die for too.  The F"

" accommodating.  Tony and Lalu making awesome drinks and amazing table settings.  The Overnight guy Felix felt like an old friend. And makes amazing quesadillas at 2am haha!  Blanca the concierge was incredibly helpful and would do anything for you. The house manager and chef Malena, I can not say enough about. Everything she made was exquisite! And such a sweet loving woman! I wanted to take her home with me.    The owner of the house Yvonneka called and spoke to me directly a few times to make sure everyt"
 in my opinion is worth the visit).  You get what you pay for and for the hospitality and the experience and the money this place is great
"When my girlfriend and i pulled up to the gorgeous Hacienda after traveling the winding jungle road up from Sayulita,  Steve was there to greet us. He said ""Welcome to Paradise!"" This proved to be absolutely true.  The tranquil setting is  incredibly peaceful offering panoramic stunning views of the ocean, particularly at sunset.  We noticed an abundance of bird species and gorgeous native plants and flowers.   The access to secluded beaches and yet it's proximity to Sayulita, made this the perfect choice. "
…

" may need.  We stayed a few nights in Sayulita, and then 5 nights at the Hacienda. I cannot recommend this place high enough and i hope to be back.  Enjoy!"
"We just got home and unpacked after a week at Casa Yvonneka. What a fantastic experience this last week has been. The city is fun, the location is great. The house is unbelievably beautiful. The view from our room was unreal. But, really, it’s the staff that creates the experience here. I’ve never experienced such amazing, friendly, thoughtful, excellent service anywhere. Felix, Tony, Malena, Monse and so many others made our week absolutely perfect. Thank you so much. I will dream of the next time I can vi"
"We wanted to head somewhere nice as our trip to Greece was canceled due to Covid. We had been to their other (much larger) property in Riviera Maya about 8 years ago. We loved it, so thought we would try this location as it is a shorter flight for us. We stayed 10 nights in Aug, and the Hotel was not busy at all  ONCE again, AMAZING.  From the message at check in, to the immaculate grounds.  Our room was kept spotless. Luis our concierge took great care of us, checking in with us and sending the daily event"

Food is amazing. the steak tacos in Fridas, and the tableside guacamole. SO GOOD. We would have an extra dissert at Fridas almost every night. The churros. Ther manager there (Eulises)  was so great. Also made room for us and also on my husbands birthday made him a big steak, not on the menu. My daughter loved the noodles at sin lin. S"
Terri and Steve's place is paradise - pure and simple.  Enjoy. Visit as often as you can. Stay as long as you can.  The Hacienda is beautiful and luxurious in every respect. I would live here if I could.
"I can't add much to the previous reviews - Hotel Casa Chacala is a very nice little hotel, clean, well-kept, and conveniently located a short walk (maybe 200-300 yards/meters) from the beach and the local amenities, with friendly helpful staff (with some who speak English, which is very helpful for those of us whose Espanol is basically non-existent).   Most of the other guests during our stay were families out for the Easter and Santa Semana holidays weeks.  There was a bit of noise from the pool area some"

I'm here now on my 45th  anniversary  This place is heaven on earth  Quiet..the hosts Steve and Terri are amazing . Wonderful and inviting  Will be back ! Best breakfast ever  Great hosts The best Margaritas!
" holiday passed, it was pretty quiet all over.    A simple but adequate common area and kitchen is downstairs next to the pool area.  Room had a small refrigerator and microwave, and we used some of the flatware and dishes from the kitchen.  You can get in-room coffee in the morning, but we elected the coffee maker option to brew our own, and got an electric kettle and french press, which we greatly appreciated.  Fresh, hot coffee on the balcony in the morning:  priceless!   (Pick up some Cafe Arisan at the"
"We have been visiting the Grand Velas since 2009, about once a year. We have never been disappointed with the service, from check in to check out and everything in between. The dinner restaurants are absolutely incredible, and the staff all around the hotel is as good as it gets. We hope to continue coming back for years to come."
"Incredible oasis away from the noise and crowds. Steve and Terri are fabulous hosts who make you feel safe and comfortable and will help with any arrangements you need to make. Terri is an amazing cook, and after you've eaten one of her delicious hearty Mexican-influenced breakfasts you will be ready to face the day. Walk through the jungle road to town or to the private beach. If you need a taxi to get out, Steve will call one for you, or you can rent a car from Gecko. (We recommend a Rav 4 or Hyundai Cret"

"We had the best time at Grand Velas. The location was stunning, the food was incredible (as was the service) and the spa really made it a once in a lifetime experience! I got a massage and loved the water therapy experience beforehand. Sen Lin has incredible Asian food. Can’t wait to return!!"
"Off the beaten track, yet accessible.  Probably best to have a car for the most freedom, but if you just want to relax, it is perfection.  The views, hosts, pool and accommodations are top notch!  Having friendly dogs was a plus for us as we missed ours. Steve and Terri are always available,  extremely helpful and exceptionally great hosts. We can't say enough about the charm of this place."
"We spent a week as guests of the wonderful folks at Casa Chacala. Valentine, Lupe and Rosa made sure that all our needs were met. The room was always clean and well-kept, and the view from our balcony was beautiful. The  amenities included a nice pool that was cleaned daily. There is an outdoor kitchen facility, with sodas for purchase. Coffee was always available at 0700, and refills were promptly provided. Bed was comfortable, and towels were large and fluffy. Highly recommend this property!"
"After little more than a year we decided to go back to Chacala and our hotel, Casa Chacala. It felt as if the proprietor, Valentin was an old  friend.  He did everything he could to make our return visit even more pleasant than the first. In addition, a mutual friend from Mexico City made the long bus trip to join us.  The rooms are very clean and reasonably priced and the location is a short block from the beach.  We are already thinking about our next visit."
"This hotel had wonderful food and options for the entire family. The dual Mexican and Continental Breakfast options were always on point and a great way to start the day before heading to the pool to relax (the brioche French toast, pastries and chilaquiles were a must!).  Grilled octopus and tacos were wonderful in the afternoon and at night, guests had a choice of 4 brilliantly crafted restaurants to choose from (Mexican, Italian, Pan-Asian/Thai and French).  My personal favorites were the Mexican and Fre"
"Very comfortable spot to stay in Chacala! New and comfortable bedding, towels and curtains. Followed suite from other reviews and asked for a coffee maker for the room which was helpful and handy!  Very helpful and accommodating hosts as I had to make a couple of changes to itinerary and nothing was too much trouble. Would highly recommend. Thanks for looking after us - Sonya and Gary - New Zealand"
 Panucho with Cochinita Pibil !! The variety of food and quality far exceeded my expectations for an all inclusive resort. I easily give the culinary experience five stars for adults and it is very family friendly too (my 3 year old niece had just as much fun sampling the kid friendly options). Would recommend !!   - Chad from New York
"We spent 2 nights at casa Chacala and had such a great time that we are going back with friends at the end of the month! Everything at casa Chacala was clean and well run, we had a comfortable king size bed- hard to find in Mexico a lovely balcony with a table and two chairs a fridge as well as free reign of the outdoor kitchen and common areas which included a sparkling clean pool, outdoor tables & chairs( great for playing cards) and hammocks, the parking was under cover and secure everything needed was p"
"We stayed here recently for 10 days in room #4 on the 3rd floor. We had a very comfortable king size bed, fridge and coffeemaker (requested) with delicious coffee supplied. The view over the bay from our patio is lovely and a small table and 2 chairs are supplied. There's an immaculately maintained pool with a couple of lounge chairs, a common area kitchen and patio area, and a fridge there with refrescos and beer.  The facilities are well-maintained and housekeeping is efficient and thorough with towels an"
" accommodating, helpful and friendly. No worries if guests don't speak Spanish; the managers' (Rossy, Lupita and Valentin) English is very good. I hope to be so lucky as to stay here again!"

"The hotel was great! Like an American hotel, with great working AC. In the heart of Tepic, Nayarit. The room service was great and they cleaned every day without us asking. The breakfast that was included was really good. Different options of meats /sides every single day. The only thing I didn't like about the breakfast was the chef. His food was great but is SUPER rude. Not once did I receive a ""Buenos dias"" back from him out of the 4 mornings that I ate there. I didn't eat breakfast my last morning there"
I don’t recommend this hotel while it’s decently clean all the rooms have vents that connected to eachother. In the morning I could look up into the room above us. There was a man coughing wry loudly and with the current health situation it was difficult to be in the same living space as someone else. The cathedral bells also go off every 15 minutes starting at 6:30am. If you plan on sleeping past 6:30 it will most definitely not happen at this hotel. 
"Hotel is nice, Clean, new. Some of the waitresses are not friendly. But the biggest problem is almost no one speaks English. While we were there, almost all guest were American or Canadian, and one could understand because the staff does not speak English."
I was just passing by and I had to book a last minute. I was there for only for 1 night on Friday November the 5th.  Great service and value. the room was spacious with a great view and what I liked the most was the complementary breakfast  and the people who served us!!!
"There is nothing to say the place is perfect, it is elegant as well. It is in the center of Tepic. It comes with free hot breakfast buffet.  The restaurant has great real Mexican food full of traditional flavors, It also offers continental food. "
"Great staff, huge room, best showers in Mexico! Underground parking was a bonus.  We walked all over Centro historic and enjoyed the accessibility to everything. Clean, quiet and great breakfast. We had a lovely park outside. We will be back! "
"The Hotel has a very good location in the downtown, nice building & excellent quality, the Master Suit is amazing! and the price the best! The personnel is very kind! the effectiveness of the service is a an opportunity, My family and many friends of the group passed special situation that expected the Hotel´s personnel react in a better way in spirit to solve situation and provide help to compensate unfotunatelly situation, but it was not; Late in deliver the room, late the maintenance of the room, more th"
The customer service was more than exceeding expectation as for the room it was very clean and comfortable.  The housekeeping staff were very nice and did a good job.  The breakfast is one thing I will miss food was delicious. 
This is the best hotel in downtown Tepic very popular with visitors for events etc. The restaurant is good and not too expensive. The breakfast is so-so. Rooms are nice and the ones on the upper floors have good views of the city and surrounding hills.  Staff is friendly.
"Really enjoyed this place, it’s close to the center and food establishments. Reception was really friendly and awesome. They take care of your car. The breakfast was indeed the most delicious I’ve had.  "
"We just got back from a week-long stay at VV and are still over the moon.  When we were enjoying ourselves at the house, we were waited on hand and foot by the amazing staff! The food was wonderfully prepared by Franko and Nestor for all the meals we had (often breakfast and dinner)!  We enjoyed days in the pool and nights on the veranda capturing all of the views that this place has to offer.  We were never without entertainment and the fabulous service of Manny, Freddy, Eddy, and Tony! They took SUCH amaz"
 as curated by those that take care of it. And all of this seems to happen flawlessly and on Jose's watch.
"Very well located in the noisy center of the city, spacious corridors and a parking. Wide bed, firm and clean. A bit better price with web promo. A definite lack of charm and not the usual mexican friendliness. A stop on the way to somewhere else. "
"8-9/5  We three British middle aged guys had spent many daytime hours travelling from Guanajuato in a combination of buses, coaches and a taxi to the hotel.  We arrived at 7:25 Tepic time and were greeted in reception and  Room 201 was in the far left corner of the large hall space. Medium size bright white room. A fitted wardrobe with four coat hangers on left as you walk in.  Two double beds (English double but American single by the sounds of some complaints) with a single long wooden headboard and bedsi"

There also many historical buildings, museums and art galleries with their architecture spanning the 16th thru the 19th centuries.

The rooms are clean with comfortable beds, good shower facilities, fans, air conditioning, strong WiFi and excellent TV service. The restaurant has simple yet tasty fare, and you can have an excel"
" upper end restaurants in this area which require a taxi to reach. The restaurants that are close by are few and with simple limited menus.  THE UGLY: Definitely no ugly, but to get 5-stars the hotel is dated and needs a renovation, the restaurant menu needs to expand and a hotel bar would need to be added. BUT this is a hotel in Tepic, México that serves mostly the Mexican business class. To do too much renovation would cause prices to rise and affect their bookings unless they took the renovation to a 5-s"

"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon. My wife is Mexican and she was very happy. As an American I'm used to more luxury...especially in a downtown area. But the building was charming. The hot water in the shower didn't work but staff told us to just let the hot water run for 5 minutes and eventually we'd get hot water...and we did. We checked out the hotel across the street. Very elegant but twice the price. All in all I was happy with our 2 day stay and when we go back to Tepic, we'll likely stay here a"
 this place. Mwah!!!!!
"If you are looking for a mediocre room for about $750 pesos per night (2 people) this is your hotel.  Three floors, no elevator so if you have trouble climbing stairs, you should ask for a lower floor......we got ""the master"", the best they had. It came with two full size beds only. Very plain.  They did have water in the hallway with a pitcher in your room with glasses.  Our room had WiFi, but could not get a signal our whole stay. It also had a flat screen TV with cable but our second day the cable was ou"

 if you don't know Spanish good luck. Good news is that is right at Historico Centro within walking of the best of the city.  Cabs are cheap if you want to go further. We took a Combi to La Laguna at Santa Maria Del Oro for a day trip and it was also very economical.  Beautiful Volcanic lake so if you like swimming or boating the place to visit.
"This was our family’s 4th reunion at the MOST AMAZING Villa Verano! The entire staff, always treats us like family from the moment we arrive until the day we have to say goodbye. We love Jose, Maribel, Hilda, Franco, Nestor, Fredy, Eddy, Manny, Meno, Arturo, Fidel, Julian, Christian, Leonor, Lalo, and Arturo Fidel! Everything is always PERFECT!!! We are already planning our next visit to our “Happy Place”!"
"If you don't want to sleep, don't want to have coffee or food, this is the place for you. I have NO idea how this hotel stays in business......It says there is a restaurant....maybe in the past, but not as of late January 2018. This was a ""medical"" trip and it would have been nice to have had a good night's sleep previous to my 3-hour bone scan experience!"
"Our Company had an absolultey amazing time at the Villa Verano.  Arturo Celada, John Douponce and Leonor Lopez went above and beyond to ensure that our group was taken care of from start to finish!  From activity planning and transportation to covid testing, they did it all. I worked closely with Leonor who is one of the most excellent concierge"
"Terrible, do not book, dirty bathroom, shower full of mold, towels are like rags torn, frayed edges, LOUD AND I MEAN LOUD MUSIC till 4 am, wind whistles through doors, no seat cover in tiny bathroom, had to put a towel so nothing goes in toilet, that had a broken seat,"
"If you like loud music all night and want to go clubs than this Hotel is for you. We stayed here on a saturday night, most of the rooms are on a very busy street with lots of noise and there were clubs that played really loud music until 7 in the morning. The door on our closet was broken and the shower leaked onto the floor in the bathroom. The internet did not work very well."
"Everything at Villa Verano is Five Star!  The accommodations, the staff, and their willingness to go the extra mile to make sure we have what we need.   A big thanks to John Douponce, Director of Operations, and his incredible staff.  The chefs, Franko and Nestor, are masterful in the menus and presentations, as well as accommodating special food requests.

"This hotel is badly in need of a remodel. The a/c did not cool. There was no hot water in the bath room needless to say there was also no soap. The bed linens were old and well worn. And to top it off the free breakfast was not very good, then they charged us $180 pesos for it."
"Staff was ok, receptionist looked too serious needs to smile more.  This is not worth the price “ discounted price”,  we paid a group rate of about $800 pesos/night.  I would of been raging in anger if I paid full price of $1,200 pesos.  There are no drawers.  The only closet space you get a is a 2 foot tube in the bathroom with 2-3 hangers.  No fridge. No coffee maker. No washcloth, what’s up with that? No pool.  No phone to call receptionist.  "
" enjoyable to be with, and always service with a smile. *Hilda and Maribel, Housekeepers, you may not see them, but they work their magic as we leave our rooms for the day... returning to fresh linens and towels, as well as any special request we might have. *Fidel and Julian, Gardeners - they are masterful gardeners - beautiful grounds and flowers. *Christian, Night Security  *always feel very safe at this villa*  I was recently one of 15 guests at this lovely resort, and already looking forward to returni"
"Unless you look & speak Spanish don't bother! Very rude, ignored us and spoke to another couple who entered after us. No service at breakfast! Although the waiter was falling over a couple of older Mexican ladies. Terrible hotel. Breakfast was an extra charge too, which we were not told when we checked in.😰"
"I have to say this is one of the worse hotels I’ve ever staid at. The gal at the front desk was rude. They didn’t have my reservation in the system AND to top it off I got a terrible room on the 1st floor next to the cleaning supplies, which meant I had NO privacy since there was constant movement outside. I couldn’t get any sleep! You can hear everything that’s going on in the hallways… forget it! Stay elsewhere."

"Even that the hotel is located right in Tepic downtown and we had a street view room, we had a lovely rest night, I assume it was the bed, the mattress, great temperature, nice windows and proper curtains. Since we arrived the bell boy (Brayan) gave us a great service. I was out all afternoon but my wife and soon stayed and enjoyed the time. Both of us ordered to room service and it was SO good for a hotel, next day we took our breakfast at the restaurant downstairs and was delicious, great service too and "

"At every visit in Tepic we usually end up staying at the Real de Don Juan for at least two nights. You want a garden side room, because street side can be a little noisy. Rooms are spacious, elegantly decorated, and clean. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The attending restaurant is excellent and very affordable. If you like beeing catered to, you will love the restaurant and its waiters. The service is amazing and the food is delicious. The only negative point is Wi-Fi access that seems unstable and"
"For $50.  Dirty noisy and NOT close to downtown# I think trip advisor has been bought off. Until this trip we could rely on t.a. but not so much any more. Plus! Their new web page is too difficult to navigate. Take the bus to Centro. Across from central de auto bus is burger king, the city bus stops there. Whee! What a ride! I love mexico. Hotel los Girasoles is nice and close and 250 pesos less! It is half a block from old centro. Local busses leave from here."
"Two-minute walk from the bus station. I paid $31/night, credit cards accepted. Room was small. Good A/C. Clean. Shower was fine. Wifi worked. Outstanding restaurant onsite--truly a pleasant surprise. (Didn't care for the included breakfast buffet, though--the options were not geared for gringos.) Perfect place to break up a long bus trip. If you want to hang out in Tepic, there are hotels directly adjacent to the Plaza Mayor..."
"The hotel is literally behind the bus station, and a 25 peso taxi from the center. Our room was on the side street, so we did sleep with earplugs. The rooms on the street were much bigger than the inside ones however, so we didn't mind the compromise.  The rooms and bathrooms are very clean and well-maintained.  Breakfast included is excellent- a buffet with many options and eggs made to order. Great coffee :) The downside for me was the street noise and a group of teenagers on a school trip who had absolut"
I loved this hotel becarse it has a very good location and it's close to e very thing you can walk to the para known as Lomas and you can take run there in the moorning and also in the evening you can walk to Zócalo
"I stayed with a group for couple of nights when I was visiting relatives in Tepic. Too many relatives showed up at the same time, and some of us had to go to a hotel, this was our pick, really, based only on Tripadvisor.  I was impressed right out of the gate, the desk had our reservations no problem and they gave us suggestion about the better rooms, very friendly and professional. The rooms themselves were not the epitome of luxury, but they were clean and functional. And given the price, a real bargain. "
" center, but that's a stretch. However, a 10 minute walk does put you at the edge of the REAL historic center. Which, BTW, is very interesting in a low key way. The central square is lined with market stalls from the local indigenous peoples (Huichole) that make bright yarn crafts.   That said, there is plenty going on around the hotel; there are bars and restaurants around that that are very good (and cheap by US standards). In particular, there is a very nice steak house (Las Banderillas) two blocks away "

Al llegar al hotel me topé con la noticia de que debía entregar una identificación como la de elector o licencia de manejo vigente y ella tenía que permanecer en recepción ante lo cual me note sorprendido porque esos documentos por seguridad no se pueden andar dejando en manos de cualquiera y mucho menos dejar de portarlos con uno mismo solo porque a un hotel de 4ta se le ocurre que es una regla dejarlos. Después de una discusión se inicia con uno de los check-in más absurdos y difíciles que jamás haya expe
"Great friendly staff.  Very clean rooms, smelled great and very comfortable beds Shuttle service is a plus Loved the access to the gym and the healthy breakfast options. Will continue to book with this company "
"I must say it was super pleasant. Fast check in, super clean, was sick in the morning and they made an appointment with a local doctor right away for me. Best fast efficient hotel chain in Mexico. Thank you!"
We were passing through on our way to the Oaxacan coast. Hotel Las Palomas provided secure parking for our heavily packed car. The room was clean and comfortable and they have a very nice restaurant with friendly and professional wait staff. The food was delicious! 
"After a sleepless night at Hotel Ejecutivo, my brother-in-law searched for a new hotel while my sister went with me for my bone scan.  He found Hotel Las Palomas.  What a HUGE difference........it was such a relief to find such a pleasant and friendly place.  The food in the restaurant was delicious and the service impeccable.  The rooms were really nice, super clean and the beds were so comfortable.  I was there in January 2018 so didn't use the pool, but the jacuzzi was terrific.  This is definitely a hot"
"It was a business trip and really enjoyed the hotel. Even though it was crowded due to vacations and several families staying, there was a good service and clean rooms and not that really noisy. The breakfast buffet is good."
"fantastic.....breakfast was good , the swimming pool was to small, the food was great, security was good parking was good , I will make reservations again  price was comfortable ....close to Walmart , fire department .. easy access to public transportation."
4 people (3 adults 1 x 12 yr old) stayed Christmas Eve - leaving Dec 25th  Exceptionally clean - checkin was very efficient  Secure parking outside with guard and electric fence  Very clean pool and separate nice warm whirlpool  Rooms were very clean and great value - Would stay here again without hesitation
"That place Looking good and nice but be sure that it's absolutely just a show.. The morning is start in work noises and every day in 05:00 the trine is passed and horn strong and long horn. In the first night we pay 1000 $ and second night 812$ and than we see on the internet that the price is 700$ We try to speak with the Reception but they don't know to speak English, only one of them speak english and we ask for the manager but he didn't come, only after few days we success to catch him and he was rude a"
"Our car broke down on the highway from Tepic to Guadalajara very close to Jala town and we were very lucky as we could leave the car on a safe place over there and traveling back to Tepic to stay on a hotel. We had a very nice welcome at the reception and fair price for the room. We had an specific need that is was a phone charger as we had no plans no stay, I now we could buy one at the store but is always nice that a hotel spoil you with some basic stuff that makes you feel “like home” or even better. Fro"
" they had bottled water at the floors, those big 20lts bottles of drinkable water, this is not common any more at the hotels and I think is a nice detail. The room was nice, clean and wide open. The bathroom was clean too and big enough, I like when the shower is a bit separate so you can use the sink or WC if your company is in a hurry. The bed and mattress were absolutely great to rest, but our dreams were interrupted by those teenagers behaving like proper teenagers at 2am. Building walls were also kind "

"It's very comfortable! The buffet is simple and delicious and the beds are ok. The rooms are quite spacious with ac included, the waiters are very nice  If you need a hotel to stay, this is a good choice for a fast stay in the city of Tepic. Keep up the good work! ..............."
"Stayed a night for business and felt surprised by the very attentive staff, room absolutely clean and comfortable, per de by pillows, comforting and pure white sheets. Needed toothpaste and brush, calls and was brought in less than 5 minutes.   Besides this, is very well located, next to Forum Shops and 8 minutes drive distance from centro histórico. "
"We've enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Hotel Fiesta Inn many times, but this time it was not an enjoyable experience.  We hadn't been there for a few months and to our surprise the quality of the buffet had seriously dropped.  The personnnel were as obliging as always, but the four dishes that I tried were definitely a step down compared to what they used to be.  Even the sweet bread which used to be prepared on the premises, was dry and stale.  I truly would not recommend this restaurant.  For us, it was no"
"I made a reservation directly at the hotel almost a month ago. The person who helped me make the reservation confirmed to me that I had American breakfast included for that special rate. However, today I was charged extra for the breakfast and when I went to the clerk desk to clarify and they told me that that rate didn’t include any breakfast. I told the person there that I had been previously confirmed, however he didn’t care to solve the issue and only replied “I don’t know why they told you this informa"
"Loved the breakfast buffet in the morning, fresh tortillas and a wide assortment of items to eat including some delicious fresh fruit. It's part of the local mall and you can rest assured you are very secure. The rooms are nice and the staff very professional. I would definitely stay again."
"Double Beds were small size, not as quoted. Pillows were uncomfortable needs to be with bed size. Checkin / out was comfortable with staff being knowledgeable and experienced. Based on nonof persons, water to be placed in rooms"
We love this hotel and the pool. We always book before our flight out of the local airport but oh my god is the food so nasty. You’re better off getting something from the places near by. The sopa de elote was so sour like it was old. The lettuce was bitter! The shrimp pasta was bland. At night we got a burger and a club sandwich to the room. No flavor and everything tasted old and soggy.  The breakfast wasn’t bad though. 
"This hotel is located in a large mall. We were here two nights in March and found the hotel to be very adequate - good shower, friendly staff, functional room and very good internet service. My only complaint, and one common to most hotels in North America now is the miserly ventilation the hotels call ""air conditioning"". The room's temperature hovered at 75 - too warm, in my opinion for comfort or sleeping.Nothing we did with the thermostat seemed to alter the setting, and we slept fitfully with a sheet on"
"Me hospedé en Casa Mayo del 16-20 de abril, desde la llegada al B&B puedes sentir lo acogedor que es el lugar, cada rincón está pensando a detalle lo que te hace sentir como en casa. Tienen un servicio de café las 24hrs lo cual fue genial para mí que soy amante del café! El B&B está ubicado en una zona muy linda a tan solo 10 minutos del centro lo cual fue muy conveniente.. La hospitalidad de Sheny es indescriptible, se aseguró de que mi estancia fuera de lo mejor, me dio muchas recomendaciones de lugares p"
Real good services the staff are the best on meeting the customer service for sure a will recommend this hotel y mi next visit defenetli I will come back to this hotel rooms real clean food good and swimming pool clean 
"I stayed on business for the third time, the staff are really helpful and friendly, special thanks to Dafne, Marisol and America. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the free WiFi is fast and reliable. The restaurant serves a good selection at breakfast and the  main course offerings are good quality. I can recommend it. "
Convinient for shoping and eating because of connection to big mall. Room is fair. Cleasness OK. Sometimes outside is noisy (Machine sound.). Wifi used to be poor but recentry improved a lot. Somotimes shower is not hot enough. Overall acceptable.
"Nice hotel with lots of character and flair, excellent breakfast buffet. Very friendly staff at the reception, restaurant, and cleaning crew. Nice garden and pool area. Bathrooms and rooms are clean but could use an update at some point in time. Great location to get around town."
Modern hotel with clean comfortable rooms and a good restaurant. There's a mall next door with anything you might need during your stay. A pro soccer team was there during my stay which brought many fans to gather outside. The hotel managed the crowds well and provided a safe environment for the guests. 
"I wouldn't recommend it, even if they give me a free service, there is a notorious lack of service, staff looks they are angry, maybe they don't get enough pay. I suggest you really supervise the rooms."
"The rooms are average. They have a buffet breakfast in the morning. No bathtubs, showers only. Convenient to shopping and cinema and restaurants at the mall. Sam's Club close by. Oxxo close by. Starbucks in the mall. Overall good stay. Enjoy!"
"Great hotel and awesome staff, they were very kind to me and helped me navigate my way around, which is important when your Spanish isn't really good. The bed was a hard firm mattress and I am use to sleeping on soft pillow top mattresses so my sleep quality was affected. Clean and professionally operated, there was a problem with the hot water and if they fix that, then I recommend this hotel to anyone. "
"While arguably the best choice for business lodging in town, Fiesta Inn Tepic has recently become the Federal Police Force's new operations base... or so it seems. While the law enforcers are kind to the other guests, you can't help but feel intimidated by the branding of high caliber firearms by the Feds. If you're ok being surrounded by Feds carrying high power firearms around the hotel and hanging around these guys at the hotel's gym (they seem to enjoy working out quite often), then I guess Fiesta Inn T"
"Sometimes a mini vacation can be as good as a regular vacation if the hotel accommodations are like or better, coming from the  Grand Hyatt Central Station in New York City to the Best Western in Tepid, Nayarit Mexico was just as good. "
please investigate I really need someone to please investigate so that this doesn't happen to anyone anymore it was the worst feeling and experience of my life i was so afraid for my daughter's life and her aunts life 
Horrible hotel! Needs extensive updates and cleaning. Some of those updates were trying to be done in middle of the day. Workers were scraping tile or something off of ceilings. As it was falling children were walking underneath without any warning from hotel or workers. Nothing blocked off or letting you know that it was dangerous! Carpets are an ugly dirty green that I don’t think they ever vacuumed. Furniture is falling apart and really old. Tub we had in room always leaked and formed huge puddle when we
"We were on a driving trip passing through Tepic and wanted a hotel which was easy to find from highway 15.   Best Western Ne Kie is easy to find on the hwy 15 that goes into town, especially from the south.   Some misses: The front desk staff confused us with their up-sell of the breakfast buffet - very rapid-fire spanish.   Our room key did not work - several times.   They don't supply enough bottled water in the room.  Some hits: very quiet, comfortable sleep.   Pretty good restaurant and breakfast buffet"
"Todo mal, mal servicio, mala ubicación, malas instalaciones, lo peor fue la actitud de quien atendía ( Julia) pero aún mucho peor, la de Gaby ( dueña). El costo super caro para lo mal que está el lugar.  Una de las peores experiencias de todos mis viajes. Viajé con mi esposa y mis 3 hijos chiquitos ( 8, 6 y 4) y todo estuvo mal. Desde la llegada con muy mala actitud, poco eficiente ( no nos sentimos para nada bienvenidos), el aire acondicionado no sirvió en la noche, la regadera muy incómoda, las persianas "
" quedó además, con nuestro dinero de las dos noches adicionales que ya teníamos pagadas, se lo pedimos pero nos dijo que no éramos bienvenidos y que si no nos íbamos que iba a venir gente de la comunidad a sacarnos de ahí.

"Es un lugar excelente, porque está en la playa pero por su construcción parece estar separado por estar en alto. Es la última cabaña de ese lado de la playa, y tiene una vista de toda la bahía además de que desde su terraza se puede ver increíble el amanecer. Se encuentra ubicada donde inicia la subida para ir a punta cometa, así que también subiendo se puede ver el atardecer. La construcción es muy singular, como un caracol, una combinación de materiales logrando un efecto muy atractivo. piedra, laja, bamb"
I had the opportunity to stay in Terrazas del Rinconcito last October. It is a very romantic place right in the beach. I enjoyed the sunrise. It's a very eco-friendly cabaña. The view is breathtaking. I truly recommend staying here when visiting the ever wonderful Mazunte.
"We had a wonderful stay at the Villa Luna de Miel. Don't get me wrong, this is not a  fancy hotel but we had a great experience. The staff was very helpful and aimed to please. We got clean towels and house cleaning daily and clean linens every 3 days. I suggest bringing a face cloth and small hand towel as they only provide bath towels.  There is a 20L bottle of drinking  water in the room for $20 pesos and a mini fridge to cool down your drinks. There is a portable fan and no air conditioning or screens. "
" the street and the town is lovely and loaded with about 50 restaurants and bars and juice stops and cafes all within 5 minutes. The beach is fabulous, and you only need to buy a few beverages to get use of the beach umbrellas and chairs provided by the many restaurants on the beach. If you prefer, you can purchase an umbrella and blanket and there is tons of room on the beach. Mazunte is a lovely town to spend your vacation. There is a lovely walk to the ridge to enjoy the sunset .  The view from the room "
…
"I think this place used to be wonderful. The location is lovely and the space itself is very pretty - wide rooms with big windows and nice terraces. Unfortunately, it has what feels like years of careless cleaning and a bit of neglect, which is a shame really! At first glance it appears clean. But then, when you look closer (or spend a few nights!), everything is covered in a layer of grime - the kind that comes from lack of deep cleaning. Bathroom is grimy and smelly, ants and pests abound in places that c"
" that is only achieved after years and years of use. Mattress has some loose springs. It's a shame really, because it has some amazing potential. But for the time being, there is better value to be had in Mazunte. A bit of love and a bit of investing in this place will go a very, very long way! :)"
"Es un lugar bonito, la alberca es muy linda, la zona de descanso tambien, incluso las habitaciones tienen muy buen gusto y el baño también. Sin embargo no cuenta con el servicio básico de agua caliente!! "
"Es un lugar perfecto para el descanzo, no ofrece  lujos y es por eso que lo hace unico, el mar esta muy cerca para apreciar el amanecer, ademas punta cometa esta muy cerca, el trato es excelente comote hacen sentir como  en casa"
"we had to wait a lot to enter the room after 17h when they finished cleaning the room. There were 2 filthy yellow towels with strange black spots and only a mini soap. The kitchenette only has 2 plates and 2 forks and you can not do anything with that. Also when it rains, the water leaks from all over the floor."
"We arrived here after checking various hostals. I took a lot to find ""Fani"" who is the one taking care of the reservations.   We saw the room with kichenette on top of the hotel and we told her that we saw this room in booking for 570 pesos and she told us that she didn't have that special room in booking (which is a lie) and that the room costed 900 pesos per night.   As the terrace roof had a few holes from the last hurricane, she would gave us the room for 650 pesos and she assured that it was only a cou"
" first time this happens.   The kitchenette is useless as you don't have anything to cook. Towels were dirty and had black spots. Also the cleaning was poor.   No breakfast included and the ""wifi"" never worked.   We left the next day. "
"El lugar es hermoso, las cabañas lindas y muy acogedoras; la terraza y la alberca son muy cómodas. La atención de Adriana y Julián es espléndida y la ubicación es perfecta. Está a unos pasos de Playa Mermejita y Punta Cometa, muy cerca de restaurantes pero sin ruido y sin gente. Muy recomendable. Perfecto para descansar y pasar unos días en la playa."

"¡ME ENCANTÓ! La posada está súper bien ubicada, justo frente al museo de la tortuga, hay que subir una escalinata algo pesada pero nada del otro mundo. Estuve en 2 habitaciones, la primera pequeñita, sin baño (pero el baño compartido súper limpio) la segunda habitación enorme, con una vista preciosa al mar, las camas riquísimas, todas con su mosquitero independiente de los mosquiteros de la habitación y con un refri pequeño. Tiene estacionamiento. La atención de Reyna, Fanny y su esposo es excelente y buen "
"Ubicado cerca de todos los atractivos de Mazunte pero en un lugar muy tranquilo para descansar y desconectarte del bullicio. Las habitaciones super limpias y tienen todo lo necesario...camas súper cómodas, baño privado, terraza y un área de ducha en la que sólo se puede tomar baño a jicarazo!!!...es genial."
"A little piece of paradise! Marco and Roberta provide a serene and beautiful eco-lodge that is seamlessly interwoven with nature and is an ideal home away from home. Each room is spacious and boasts its own personality. Accommodations are very clean, and there is an enjoyable open-air kitchen and dining area for those warm summer nights. Only minutes from the local beach. Highly recommended!"
"The Olivo suffers a bit from being some distance from both the ocean and the town centre (although for some people, this could be a plus because it is quiet apart from the birdsong).  However the warm welcome from Marco (who speaks English) and Roberta (only Spanish, apart from Italian) more than made up for this.  The dogs are friendly too!  The communal area around the kitchen is good for meeting both them and anyone else staying there.  My room was large, clean and mosquito-proof.  Not the cheapest aroun"
 and Agustinillo is calm and safe for swimming.
"I really enjoyed my stay at ""el Manguito"". Esther is an amazing host and owner. She is very friendly, always helpful and has a lot of recommendations about what to do or where to go in and around Mazunte. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the dogs are a definite plus! ;) The location is a dream. Only a five minute walk from the beach or the main road. I actually extended my stay twice because it is such a lovely place. I definitely recommend staying there."
"The Rooms/Bungalows are wonderful, and well designed in every detail.  You wake up to a fantastic view of the surrounding nature and can do bird watching from bed. Super nice place to escape from the daily routine. The manager is really caring and gives good recommendations too.  This part was exactly what I was looking for.  Sadly, the place is badly maintained. A lot of stuff is just badly repaired or not at all. The staff is disinterested and unmotivated.  Towels and sheets didn’t get exchanged until we "

"My stay at Posada Olivo started with Marco welcoming me  by telling me that he was expecting me sooner.  I then was led up to my room which was absolutely beautiful and clean as well as very nicely decorated with views of the lush tropical gardens of the posada. There are also screens on all the windows meaning that you don't have to use the mosquito net over the bed. There is a powerful fan provided, but the room did not have soap or towels and the wifi router is not positioned to cover the rooms.  The kit"
"It's a small hostel with one 7-beds dorm and one private room. The owners are very friendly, helpful and they send you everyday things to do in Mazunte. We slept both in the dorm and the private room. It's very clean and comfortable. There is some hammocks in the garden. The kitchen is very useful. It's a very small hostel so you will feel at home! I would recommend definitely this hostel!! :) "
"Coming late in the day to visit the ecoturistico we decided to stay here as it was getting late. Having stayed in many other places in Oaxaca, we can say this was outstanding. For M$750 we got an en-suite with two large beds, 2 minutes walking from the beach. We slept like babies and being able to enjoy the stars with almost (Mazunte is on the other side of the cliff) no light pollution is incredible. When we were there we left it late (to see the sunset on the beach), so there was no food left to get. But "
" menu. And this for way higher prices than what you pay at the local restaurants. The hotel claims the breakfast is included but you just get a tiny bowl of fruit and yogurt, with super dry bread on the side (we even had to ask for this every time despite it supposedly being a part of the menu).  Good rooms, bad service and food. Overpriced.  Seems like there was a good concept originally, and now just runs for profit."
…
 checkout was at 11am and they had to clean the rooms.
"El La Ventanilla es un lugar idóneo para encontrar tranquilidad, alejado del bullicio de las ciudades y con el único sonido del mar.   Las instalaciones de las cabañas son perfectas para descansar después de un recorrido en los manglares de la comunidad, visitar en tu auto Mazunte (se encuentra a 10 minutos), Zipolite (se encuentra a 15 minutos) o Puerto Ángel (se encuentra a 25 minutos). Los cuartos y las camas están muy limpios, además que te dan suficientes toallas. Cuentan con un baño en cada habitación"
"I am well travelled,  but this place blew us away big time. One of the most charming hotels I've ever seen. Immersed in nature and with a wonderful sea view.  The best part is the staff and particularly Isidro, whose kindness and generosity goes way beyond his professional duty. He is a truly marvellous host. Don't hesitate a moment!"
"Good pictures do not make good hotels : Cocolia might be an acceptable place to feed up your instagram but no serious hospitality should be expected from this place. Manager on duty is as friendly as an ATM, help and services are inexisting, wifi and hotwater are random...Top of the pop : what they call a continental breakfast is in fact a micro portion of fruits with ONE slice of bread from supermarket (no butter, no jam) ; and what they describe ""secluded"" must be translated ""far away from everyting, 40 m"
"Our stay at Celeste Del Mar was nothing short of brilliant. From the moment we booked, Siddhartha was so helpful and made every aspect of our stay as good as it could possibly be. We enjoyed going to sleep with the sound of the ocean in the background and waking up to sunrise walks along the beautiful Mermejita beach and sometimes seeing whales coming up for air in the distance.  The breakfasts are great and we enjoyed meeting other guests and sharing some nice conversations. I couldn’t recommend this place"
"In Mazunte its the place to stay. Super friendly and helpful stuff, amazing location, excellent service and top clean rooms. You have an amazing view, really good restaurant with wide choices. They have a Palapa (roof covered yoga area too. I hope they start regular yoga classes soon. (when you arrive first time by car: go into Mazunte center, than turn right toward to the beach -at the first paved road you find after the Pharmachy-than turn right right after Kometa caffe shop. You will arrive to the cemete"
"Very beautiful place. Super clean and the rooms are very quiet. We take the room n7 and it was breathtaking. All the staff was really friendly and professional , especially Daniel of the reception, very nice guy!  Delicious and fresh food , breakfast included !   Nothing to say , I will recommend for sure this magical place!"
"The a la carte breakfast is delicious and it's fun to share a fruit platter and an egg dish with a partner! Had some of the best papaya ever, and one morning we ate roasted sweet pumpkin as a breakfast dish, absolutely fabulous. The location is perfect at the meeting of coastal forest and ocean, and the design of the cabins maintains really clean and healthy indoor air, with a cool nighttime airflow through the shady side windows. The team of hosts is amazing and helpful, with great stories to tell about th"
"Celeste del mar Is a really comfortable place, the rooms are very clean, I loved that in the up part of my bungalow there was an open space with a perfect view of the sea. It's a quiet place, in the night you can hear the sound of the sea and it's really near to go walking. People was very nice, and kind every time we asked something, I recommend it hugely."
"A magnificent place in the middle of the jungle. Quiet and perfect for a peaceful retreat with amazing ocean and hillside views. Cocolia has everything you need for a slow morning and relaxing night. The town, playa escondida and playa mermejita are about a 15-20min walk (depending on the pace)."
"Celeste Del Mar is a cute place very close to the Mermejita Beach in Mazunte. If you are looking for a calm and quiet stay away from the main beach, this is a good choice. The superior rooms have a lofted area with a hammock and a beautiful view. The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating."
"We absolutely loved our stay at the Cocolia Hotel in Mazunte. There isn't much left in Mexico you could consider off-the-beaten-path, but this place comes close. The road up to Cocolia is pretty rough, but once you're there it's instant love. Chic, minimalist casitas. Each one totally private & open to stunning views. The casitas are efficient and feel cosy, even though one entire wall opens up to forest and views. No AC, which amazingly it doesn't even need. The design takes advantage of lovely cross breez"
"This is a really nice place, the owners are very nice and the service was excellent. However, it is too expensive. After 3 days, we moved to another equally charming place, but for half the price. We stayed in this place because it was ranked number 1 in TripAdvisor, but we regretted the decision because it was too expensive compared to other equally nice places in Mazunte."
"These eco-bungalows are an intimate and lovely retreat only steps from the beach. Walking distance to Punta Cometa and town of Mazunte. Really clean, lovely accommodations with hammocks and beautiful details throughout. Great help from Siddhartha, the owner, and Abi. It was truly a magical and wonderful place to stay! The beach was beautiful and mostly unpopulated, the perfect place to watch the sunset. Hope to return soon and stay again!"
I have stayed at Arigalan 3 weeks in May and had a great time there. I attended the modul 1 intensive yoga course at Hridaya Yoga. It is literally less than a 2 minute walk to the meditation hall from the bungalows and cabanas. Rose and her staff were wonderful and very helpful. I am already planning to return for a few weeks at the end of the year... can`t wait to be back there.
"We arrived for four nights and were greeted with a welcome beer, which was very welcome indeed. The room was rustic luxury. A good size and a hammock on a mezzanine that had a view of the ocean. The owner, on-site, and staff were always helpful and attentive. We had a little issue with a mosquito net, and it was replaced instantly. These people understand the concept of service and hospitality."
". This an amazing place, a little slice of paradise on earth. Rose and her staff are amazingly gracious, kind and extremely helpful. Denisse offers a superb yoga class and is highly recommended reiki practitioner. The views are absolutely amazing, watching both sunrise and sunset from this hilltop gem.  Rooms are spotless and tastefully decorated and the bed is comfortable. Falling a sleep to the crashing of the ocean waves is idyllic.  Yoga workshops are scheduled throughout the year, we altered our plans "
"My room on the second floor of the bungalow was just gorgeous - I had all the light I wanted, the bed was perfect, and everything was super clean.  I liked the bathroom too - open, airy.  And the host provided shampoo and soap and good towels.  I also loved that the drinking water was provided in the room!  And the hammock upstairs in the room is just pure luxury.  I initially thought the place is right on the beach, but it is behind some other construction, about 15 steps from the beach. I was first disapp"
"Rose, the owner, and her great little team, are hard working and super helpful. The rooms and the premises are kept clean and the ambiance is quiet and peaceful. Great for meditation, yoga, or to just lay back and rest for a while. The dark room is also a great tool for that. The meals cooked by Rose, during such a retreat, are delicious and made according to your preferences. Full of delicate attentions overall. Recommended."
Rose and her staff were absolutely gracious and kind! The hotel had an amazing view of the ocean and was close to a quaint little town called Mazunte. I stayed here because of the silent meditation retreat I attended and am already planning to return for a visit to relax. Thank you Rose for your kindness and hospitality!!
" (apparently the waves only come down from Dec to Feb), but the spectacular waves were amazing to watch. Again, at first I was sad I could not swim right next to my temporary home, but then was grateful for the beautiful waves show that took place every day.  I could sit on the beach chair for hours mesmerized. Especially since that meant that the beach was always empty!  Probably a very few places left like this in the world.  To get to the town, you need to hike up a hill by a cemetery and then schlep dow"
I stayed here for a week and enjoyed every relaxing moment.  It is in an excellent location to walk to any beach or place in town.  The pool is covered and refreshingly cool after a hot day of bumming around.  I could not get enough of the ocean views and took countless pictures.  I slept with only the screen doors closed so I could hear the surf all night.  This hotel has a/c but I never used it because of the ocean breeze and sounds.  Highly recommend.

"I just got back from an amazing stay at Las Almas and cannot wait to come back! Vlad is an incredible host with a great heart and energy, his house is gorgeous and the food is amazing (he even taught me how to make the sourdough bread they serve at breakfast).   I also met some incredible people there (friends of Vlad and guests) which made me feel at home and made my time in Mazunte even better. The rooms are super comfortable and beautiful, I felt like sleeping on a cloud. My stay would definitely have no"
"I have stayed at Arigalan several times (5) and have always been pleased with my stay.  I attend training and retreats at Hridaya Yoga and it is literally less that 3 minutes to the meditation hall from the bungalows and cabanas.   Rosa is always accommodating while I am in silence and understands what the teachings are all about, having attended retreats there herself.  The staff is most gracious and friendly.  I also like the fact that it is an adult only facility.  Being lulled to sleep each night by the"
"I stayed with my mom at Hotel Arigalan for 5 nights, and our only complaint is that we weren’t able to stay longer. From start to finish, Rose and her staff were incredibly kind and thoughtful hosts. Rose could not have been a more accommodating host. We loved the location of Arigalan, with easy access to both Mazunte and San Augustinillo. The views from Arigalan are spectacular and there is easy access to the best swimming bay on San Augustinillo."
" would recommend to bring comfortable shoes since you have to walk about 10 minutes to get to the Mazunte beach. Although I would suggest to skip that beach and visit some of the others around Mazunte.   I definitely recommend Las Almas for your stay in Mazunte. Heaven on earth,"
"We spent a week at Hotel Arigalan and were very sad to leave. Rose is warm and helpful and her staff keep the rooms and communal areas beautifully clean. The hotel offers affordable, comfortable and clean accommodation. It is on a hill between San Augustillo and Mazunte, which is great, because you get a cooling breeze for your siesta and you can choose between two stunning beaches. I would highly recommend both the hotel and the area."
"Had a great week plus here, staff were always helpful and rooms clean and comfortable, also has access to mazunte and San augustinilllo which is great so you can choose the quiet or louder town, was sad to leave"

"My 5 friends and I had the pleasure of renting out Las Almas for 3 weeks and we could not have had a better stay. We came to Mazunte for a yoga course and had our beautiful private escape at Las Almas overlooking the ocean. Everyday we watched the sunrise and sunset over the ocean and felt the cool breeze glide over our skin. we enjoyed breakfast each morning with tropical fruits, scrambled eggs, coffee and fresh vegetables. The 4 cabanas were perfect - extremely comfortable beds with little fans inside for"
"I spent 10 days in the daek room that the Arigalan Hotel offers for spiritual seekers. Rose, the owner, was extremely friendly feom the first moment we met. She let me cisit the room a couple of times before my retreat and get adjusted to it. The room is quiet and the service from the hotel excellent. On my request I was given 1 vegetarian meal per day. The food was extremely delicious and made my day :)  The room itself has everything need for a dark room retreat (shower, WC, AC, fan, a comfortable bed and"

"My husband and I were so happy and comfortable at Las Almas. The grounds and rooms are beautiful and very well-kept, with gorgeous and thoughtful touches that surround you with beauty and serenity. The location is lovely, the views are incredible, and the hotel is very quiet and peaceful.  Vlad is the host with the most! He made us feel like we were visiting an old friend. His hospitality abounded throughout our stay. He made sure we had plenty to do, made arrangements for us to get massages at the hotel, t"

"As Lawrence Durrell wrote in the Quartet: « These are the moments which are not calculable, and cannot be assessed in words; they live on in the solution of memory, like wonderful creatures, unique of their own kind, dredged up from the floors of some unexplored ocean. ». My stay in Las Almas is one of these creatures for me.  But more pragmatically ;): - Awesome location, the bungalow are typical and also very clean. Very quiet place.  - Details are taken care of (water in the rooms, towels at the pool, co"
"Lugar ideal para una buenas vacaciones y tranquilas. El lugar es espacioso, habitaciones limpias con todo lo necesario. Personal amable. Tiene cocina compartida para preparar alimentos y comer ahi en una terraza muy bonita. Buenos precios."
"I went for a drink and snack here. My bill was 115 however they didn’t have change for a 500 note, at this point they called the owner who was drinking there and said it was 350 min spend. It said on the board at the bottom of the steps but had been rubbed off on the board outside the restaurant and wasn’t mentioned when I arrived so I thought the first sign was old. My problem isn’t really with the money however, the owner was so rude and nasty to me I cried when I got back to my hotel. So far everyone in "
"Wonderful view, which alone would deserve a visit! Cocktails are great, especially those with mezcal, and the vibe is engaging. Food is also good, both main dishes and starters. This is one of the best restaurants in Mazunte. Definitely recommended. "
"We were treated very rudely by the owner, demanding more tips. Despite the fact that we spent a lot of money there and were generous with the tips. The view was nice, but nothing else good to say about this place. Would never come back!"
"I came here for my birthday with my best friend. We stayed here for three nights, explored the beaches and Punta Cometa, the southernmost point of Mexico. I was surprised to read such aggressively negative reviews of the Copal, as my stay was blissful in every way. The staff was kind and attentive, without bothering you constantly, they even upgraded our room without charge.   Even though we were only two people, our bungalow had two floors, the first with a large bed and the second with two smaller beds, a"
" did not know what to expect regarding the toilet situation. Luckily, you have two options regarding the loo - a closed door room behind the restaurant, very private and out of the way of foot traffic, and a GLORIOUS throne, atop a structure, where you have a 360-degree view of the surrounding nature, complete with a clever and surprisingly odourless ""plumbing"" system where you sprinkle sand or water over your... ahem... business. I've never reviewed the loo-situation of any establishment before, but honest"

"Sara and Jerome are sweet and attentive hosts who always have a friendly word for their guests. The garden, rooms and kitchen are very charming and tasteful and provide a relaxing atmosphere. We loved our stay at Posada El Jardin a lot."
I love the view at this restaurant and have dined here before. But was very disappointed. The service was really not good. They forgot to place my order and i waited for over an hour to receive my dinner. 
"This place was not at all what I expected to see. The staff was absolutely lovely and the ocean view from the restaurant is amazing. Other than that, the rooms were very simple and the windows are tiny, I ended up leaving and didn't stay a single night, however; i was charged a deposit and another night which is really upsetting. The location is hard to get to so I had to take a cab only to be disappointed by the place and turn around and order another cab into the city.   Llegue tarde porque hubo un accide"
"This place is cute but so noisy all you can do is laugh. Right next to nightclub AND place where trucks are filling up with water all day long. Plus the roosters which I imagine are everywhere in Mazunte. We were there Dec 26-Jan 1 which is no doubt the noisiest time of the year, but still. and 4 glasses for a place that accommodates 8 people is a bit inhospitable, hippie vibe notwithstanding."
"The place is really nice, full of vegetation.  it is situated in a really quite zone near the beach and the Main Street.  The rooms are cute and clean as well as the toilets.  The hosts are really kind and they make you feel really comfortable. You will feel like at home pretty soon.  The food is really good as well (if you like Mexican food you will love it). I really enjoyed my vacation there. I had the opportunity to meet really nice people, relax and party a little bit as well.  Perfect place for backpa"
" imaginaba algo mucho mas limpio, cuidado, y abierto."
"Recientemente tuve la oportunidad de visitar este lugar, son muy ricas las cenas, en particular las pizzas, el ambiente es muy bohemio. Ideal para una velada romantica con tu pareja. El servicio es informal pero es bueno, son muy atentos."
…
"Cenamos aqui en nuestra primera noche en mazunte, nos parecio un lugar agradable..una luz media, y una atención de primera, todos muy amables la pizza al horno, estulo italiano muy rica, los precios accesibles y el ambiente muy alegre y relajante! sin duda regresaremos pronto..!"
"Estilo italiano, la pizza es cocinada en un horrno de lena controllado por un pizzero Italiano de nombre Marco.....muy muy buena y no es cara .......decisamente lo recomiendo a todos...."
"Originalmente nos quedaríamos en El Copal (900 pesos por noche) pero algo salió mal con la reservación y tuvimos que salir a buscar lugar donde quedarnos. Encontramos La Dolce Vita, atendido por Angelo, a quien todos en Mazunte tratan con cariño y respeto. La Dolce Vita es un excelente restaurante, la comida es de lo mejor y a muy buen precio. Recomiendo los desayunos y probar el café americano (con café de la costa oaxaqueña por supuesto). Tiene 4 habitaciones pequeñas pero muy cómodas, con baño propio, un"
"Stopped in for a quick lunch right on beach. Comfortable tables and good bar. Ordered basic Oaxacan cheese quesadillas which were served with rice, as well as chips and bean dip. First  salsa was waaaaayyy too hot even for our guide! Second was a nice chipotle mayo type. Cold beers hit the spot too!"
"This place has typical Mexican food and it's really inexpensive and well made. Great juices and smoothies for breakfast. You can also find tours to the beaches, whale and turtle sanctuaries. It's a great really local spot. I enjoyed it, the rooms we're a great value."
"This hotel only have three rooms and is located right on the beach. The included breakfast was great (Hot cakes, coffee and eggs). The room is a couple of stairs, with a private terrace and great view. We extended our stay because we loved it so much. There are not many tourists around and often your are all alone at this great beach.   One evening they arranged an outdoor movie screening where one could get dinner + beverage for 70 pesos.   The staff is very friendly and helpful, the only minus is that we "
"It is located 2 blocks from the beach and right around the corner from great retaurants. The rooms are well sized and beds are confortable. The owner is very attentive and even offered to give us a ride no charge to the main road the day of our leave for us to catch a bus to our next stop. They have kitchens with pots, pans and everything you might need to cook a meal and save some bucks. They have mosquito nets on the beds and I slept great without having to worry about the annoying bites. I would definite"
"Posada Ziga is a gem.  One of my favorite places ever.  I’ve returned to Mazunte multiple times and have stayed at Posada Ziga the last two times. The host family is warm and helpful.  Location is perfect.  If you choose to order breakfast, it's delicious.   Can't wait to return.  HIGHLY recommend!"
"Posada las flores is very well located, in front of the sea. The view it’s beautiful. It’s clean and it has a great service with a little restaurant, where you can have breakfast, you can good down to the beach very easily.  It doesn’t have air conditioner.  The heart of Mazunte it’s very close, you can do everything by walking "
"It says it all in the title. Just a chill spot to stash your stuff and wander down to the beach, nice loungey hammock spots too. The breakfast was nice and simple too. Close to punta cometa as well for sunset. All in all would reccomend for the price"
My room had air conditioning and hot water and terrace with ocean view on the beach. These all are great things in Mazunte. Staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend. Also on end of beach less crowded. San Angustinillo is only 5 minute walk over the hill also and well worth a visit also. 
"If they have sea view rooms available do not hesitate to book this place! The room is big and the bed was super comfortable, the bathroom is clean and modern. The staff are great, especially Tania, really lovely. But the best thing about this place is the view from the balcony, and falling asleep to the sound of the waves, just perfect! I hope to be back very soon!"
"Decent place but fairly dank/dark rooms and not very friendly staff. Also, fairly far from the beach. I'd recommend this place if you have some reason to be on that side of town but otherwise, would recommend others."
"We stayed at Posada Ziga for two nights and loved its location on Playa Mazunte, close to shops, eateries, and Punta Cometa.   Checking in and out was very easy; everyone was kind and helpful; the room was clean and comfortable; the balcony offered a lovely view of the beach to the left and lush green hills to the right. We didn’t eat at the restaurant, so can’t speak to its quality, but it’s very nice to have drinks on a terrace with a view.  A few things made it a four-star, rather than five-star experien"
" renovations were going on directly below us, and the noise made it impossible to relax in our room during the hottest time of day, so that at the end of two days, we were glad to change hotels.   Nevertheless, we thought it was good value for the money and could see potentially staying at Posada Ziga longer, as well as coming back again."
"Wonderful place at a very good location, just seconds away from the beach. The hostel has a nice garden, with several hammocks! Nice strong morning coffee and amazing staff. A very welcoming vibe, the perfect place for some days of chilling out 🔆"
"Lovely little hostel 30 seconds from the beach. The staff are friendly and helpful, offering ideas of what to do or just chatting about nothing in particular in the evenings. The breakfast is a very nice touch. Rooms simple, but perfectly comfortable, and the garden is a very nice place to relax."
…
"Mazunte is awesome and this place is nice and affordable option to stay in. They have dorms and private rooms, all equipped with mosquito nets. Mosquitos are terrible! Breakfast is included in the price (simple, but tasty with fruits, good coffee and cereals). 2 minutes walking from the beach and 5 minutes from colectivo stop.  The guys, managing the hostal, are super friendly. Always have a good advice about Mazunte. They took us to the sunset spot (beach) for nice views and evening swimming. Strongly reco"
"Very nice spot to chill and meet new people, & literally a two minute walk from the beach. Mazunte was magical and the girls running the hostel were very sweet. Only downside was when they more than doubled the prices for current guests during the free music festival - about $20 usd for a bunkbed..."
"A great room with the balcony to the sea!. Very comfortable place, amazing view and location was perfect, everything is close and we had no problem with the car. Also we had breakfast there pancakes were delicious as well as the fish and eggs. Very nice place to enjoy and relax!. "
"I stayed at Posada Ziga for over a month in May/June and was in a room which was overlooking the Pacific Ocean. I loved going to bed and falling asleep with the sound of the waves. My room was spacious, had 2 beds and a terrace with that beautiful view. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels given every second. The owners were always very friendly. They also have a restaurant were I ate from time to time. Beach is just in front of your nose."
"Beautiful spot, right on the beach. If you're lucky as I was, you'll get a seaview balcony, which will make hard for you to leave the room at all. It wasn't very big, but it had two double comfortable beds with mosquito nets, and a nice bathroom. No hot water, but who needs it in that weather anyway?  Also, it's right at the end of the beach, so it's pretty quiet in there, and just a 5 minute walk to the other side of the beach, where most of the restaurants are. A special mention for the staff, really nice"
"The cabanas miramar ara a beautiful place a little on the hill of Mazunte. You have a amazing view to the beach and the sea, and if you wake up at time you can see the magic sunrise every day! You only need 5 minutes to the beach and maybe 8 minutes to the village of Mazunte. My cabana was very comfortable (big enought, with Bathroom & toilet, fan and mosquito net, there is only cold water, but it’s so hot in Mazunte that you really don’t need hot water :D ) I had everything that I needed, and the place was"

"Although family friendly, this hotel has a fun and friendly staff that have great tips on where to go out at night. I highly recommend the Mezcaleria and small palapas that are both less than a 5 minute walk from this beautiful hotel."
I have been visiting here since 1996 Mazunte a special energy noted Miramar is minutes walking to everything you would want on a retreat to re-energize your internal battery. The Ordonez Family will treat you to whatever your adventurous heart desires. Punta Cometa ask for the Jaccuzzi  you will always remember and if your into fishing they will connect you.  
"The price is not cheap but worth the view from your private balcony. The room/bed is clean but not spotless, the bathroom could have been cleaner... Cold shower,fan,mosquito net,wifi. It was quite hot during night inside of the mosquito net even with the fan on,but the mosquito net is a must even when wearing bug spray... We slept with doors and windows open which gave us lots of nice breeze from the sea. And with doors and windows open during sleep, we didnt encounter any safety problem. The path leading t"
"Had a great time at Las Flores. It's close to both beaches, punta cometa and central Muzante. The rooms and pool are lovely, as pictured. The real winner was meeting Carlos and his team. They made us feel very welcome and made sure we had a really fun trip. "
"I stayed at Posada Mazuntinas for a week in mid-January.  We had the Sky Casita which is up a few flights of stairs, but David, the host, transported our luggage (a very nice surprise!).  The Sky Casita is one indoor room and one open-air room with a kitchen - the open air and location made it feel a bit like a treehouse.  The frig was huge and the kitchen very well equipped with drinking water included (refills only US$1).  I was worried about not having air-conditioning, but the powerful ceiling fans made"
"We stayed there for two nights and enjoyed it. It is a good price for the amazing view, the rooms are very basic but clean. It is all about the view! It is also nice to be away from the main street, where all the other hotels are. The owners are nice, the place is safe and again the view is awesome! Great for a few days."
"Laura, the manager, is great. All the staff were very attentive. There is home-made taste breakfast available in a very affordable price. It is located minutes away form the turtle museum, beach and Punta Cometa. There is also a massage available with a good eco-view."
" while in town.  Don't miss the sunrise from the rooftop - it rises over the ocean, you're situated above the tree-line and it is really worth it. The casita was very clean and the staff is very friendly.  Overall, I highly recommend this place.  If you don't want to do the stairs, there are other options on the property."
"I've spent with my wife 2 nights in our honeymoon. Rooms are very nice and spacious, everything worked perfect. Staff was almost invisible, the room cleaning was ok but we didn't have anyone for asking anything, even we left the keys to no one in the reception. May be this happened because we stayed during 24 and 25 of December, however wasn't good. Internet connection wasn't good enough at our room."
…
"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. In fact, we arrived at 5am and were welcomed in and shown to bed, no problems, no extra price - so 3.5 nights.  It's well located, 5 mins walk to Mazunte beach (right) or 5 mins walk over the hill to San Agustin (our favourite) left.  The garden and bungalows are thoughtfully designed and lovingly kept. At the moment, the garden is blooming in colour and teaming in wildlife - the butterflies are stunning. The pool is a tinge of green around the edges, but was clean"
"We spent the month of January 2016 in the Mazunte area.  We stayed at the Posada las Mazuntinas in the beginning of January and then again at the end of January because we liked it so much.  We stayed first in the cabana at the top of the hill.  It has a full kitchen, living area open air.  The bedroom and bathroom is enclosed.  There is mosquito netting surrounding the bed and fans to keep you cool.  We were very pleased and enjoyed our stay so much that we rented again at the Posada.  David and Tiki are e"
" we wouldn't have used it anyway. At night, the bungalows seem to trap the heat so perhaps request the higher rooms to catch a breeze. Even with 2 fans, we struggled to sleep through the heat, despite the best efforts of the staff to accommodate us.   Wifi wasn't available in our room, we had to walk up the steps and wave out devises around, which wasn't ideal, but an insignificant detail in the scheme of things. Perhaps because it is quiet, breakfast also wasn't available here (though there clearly is a re"

" there are lots of places to eat in town.  We enjoyed eating out at the ""cinnerante"". (dinner and a movie at different restaurants in town).  There is internet available in the cabanas, though the town's internet service is slow at certain times during the day.  We had no problem connecting.  We would not hesitate to stay there again."

You have to repeat it at least 3 times if you have a request simple as having a coffee in the morning, broom your room, etc! They only clean bathroom once a day! Kind of disgusting! And please do not eat there! All of us have been sick because it’s very not well clean! And if you wanna make a temexcal with the owner Emeliano be ready t"

"As the whole town is quiet right now, so is the hotel. We shared the pool with a Mexican family from DF and we all tried our language skills out. The 2nd floor rooms are lovely and airy with great balconies, aka - Robinson Caruso style. Great for cocktails and a breeze. The resturant is not open as it's so quiet there, so be prepared to walk down the road to find something. No shortage of resturants however, we would recommend this hotel and would stay again. "
"The owner Emiliano was pissed drunk many times, having a very disturbing energy, screaming at me concerning money, leading completely inappropriate Temaxcal, leaving the ceremony many times for over 20+ mins. His wife Faye did an excellent job cooking for us and helping us overall. Maintenance serive was not sufficient. Toilets missing paper many times. Most people got sick during their stay, we don't know why. Best thing about the place is the view and the kids."
"I spent four months in the cabana pictured here. It was wonderful. David and Tiki are warm friendly hosts and always there when you need them. If you go missing, as I did when I took off for a few days exploring without telling them, they get concerned and that is very comforting to someone traveling alone. I had everything I needed to be self sufficient for my stay and when something wasn't just right, David was on it asap. I found the village of Mazunte to be the quiet, laid back place you hear about.

This is a very nice place if you want to stay in Mazunte. You have to walk like 5 minutes to get to the beach but still is a very comfortable place. The people there will make everything they can to make your stay the best. The rooms are nice and clean. There's no TV and the wifi is not so good. The pool is nice surrounded by tropical gardens (be sure to pack some mosquito repellent because you will need it) and at nights you can listen the ocean. You won't regret staying here! And it is a pet-friendly hote
"The views and the atmosphere are great. it’s not that far, a 5-7min slightly uphill walk from the main street or the beach. The private room we had was very nice, comfy bed with ok mosquito net, a fan and a great view. The bathrooms were good and as clean as possible in this dusty environment. The kitchen was kind of basic. Overall, the views & the atmosphere make it. Would recommend it to people who don’t have higher expectations, then it’s good value. It’s a bit alternative & eco, we liked it."
" my own cooking, there are lots of places to eat in town and even more during any holiday times. Never tired of the many trails and roads with great views. I would highly recommend a stay in any of their cabanas whether for a night or two or the entire winter."
"Great place to go if you’re looking to be caught in a scam.  First of all, the place is located 10 min away from the beach, which is a bummer. You have to walk through a really steep dusty road to get to a beach that you cant even swim in.  The owner told me that there was a construction finishing in the kitchen area, but that she would make up for it with a discount. Every morning we woke up with construction noise, and workers talking loudly, however since we had the discount we were ‘fine’ with it.  It w"
the place is wonderful even if your are not  in front of the ocean. just 5 minuts walking from the beach you can find a beautiful tropical garden sourrounding the rooms and a nice little swimming pool. the road to arrive is not the best but don't warry when you will arrive you will be very happy of your choise. the staff is nice and available. I strongly recommend this place
"Cute, simple cabanas that suit the environment, nestled up high on the point with the most incredible view. We had a cabana for a few nights right on the edge of the cliff, so woke up and rolled outside into the hammock to take in the view every morning. The steps down to the ocean were on our doorstep. Emiliano was welcoming and answered all of our questions. He will organise meals and taxi rides for you if you need, just check all the pricing when you ask. This is a very laid back place so you need to be "

" that the breakfast fee had to be payed in cash. I was si surprised!  I called the owner and told her that no one ever talked about the breakfast being extra, nor did we ever see a price list or a manu. Also, i sent her a picture of the room rules where it clearly stated that it was included.  She THREATENED ME WITH CALLING THE POLICE AND SEIZE MY THINGS IF I DIS NOT PAY IN FULL.  Obviously she didnt accept the mistake. We proceeded to pay because SHE WAS GOING TO CHARGE THE COST OF HER MISTAKE TO HER EMPLO"

"Nous avions réservé par bowling une ""cabane de luxe"". A notre arrivée on a tenté de nous loger dans un trou à rats. Il a fallu menacer de partir et demander le remboursement pour que l'on nous donne une cabane à peu près conforme à notre réservation.  Au bout de trois jours, le ménage n'étant pas fait,  nous avons réclamé. On nous rétorqué qu' il n'était pas inclus dans le prix et qu'il fallait payer 100 pesos par passage. Nous avons refusé et obtenu finalement gain de cause. La salle de bains est extérieur"
" This is a super relaxed, small beach town and we were there in the low season so very chilled and quiet vibe. There's a couple of great places to eat and drink throughout your days; the healthy cafe right on the beach had the yummiest salads. We were mostly swimming and lazing about, but yoga and turtles also seem to be attractions of this place! Highly recommend a visit to this little haven, it was a great escape and Balamjuyuc was the perfect location to enjoy it."

"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying at Los Mazuntinas for a week and it was incredible. David gave us a welcoming and thorough introduction upon our arrival and left us with an intuitive map of the town and plenty of restaurant suggestions. Our bungalow was the perfect size for us! We had a mosquito net for around our bed, a 5 gal tank of potable water, a mini fridge, fresh towels everyday and even a bucket of water outside our door to rinse our sandy feet off after a day at the beach. The hammoc"

Spontaneous trip to Mazunte turned out to one of the most memorable places and time.  Specially because of this location. Emiliano makes you feel welcome. So friendly staff. Beautiful cabanas. Nice and clean. All you need. All perfect. Thank you. 
 se abrió.  ella usa las aguas residuales para regar las plantas y estas son una belleza.  usted es el tipo de huésped que ningún hotel querría soportar.  Por qué reservaste por 4 semanas si no estabas satisfecha!?
"The Cabanas are located on a beautiful hill just above the bay of Mazunte. There are stairs down to the beach, which you reach in about 5 minutes. We had a shared room with 4 beds in a wooden cabana, simple, but with a ventilator, hammock and mosquito nets. The view from our terrace was incredible. The only handicap is the owner: He didn't really explain anything to us when we arrived. So we also didn't know that you have to pay for the Mezcal sauna (in the end they didn't charge us) also the shared kitchen"
"I had an 100% positive experience staying at Balamjuyuc. The cabin had the best view of the ocean. Great balcony for watching the ocean and eagles flying by and for practicing yoga. I loved my bed, it was cozy and it was right by the window. All I had to do to see the sunrises in the morning was to open my eyes. The cabin is simple, but very cozy.  Bathrooms and showers were always clean. Communal kitchen is a bonus. The location is superb. It is outside of the busy area of Mazunte and is just a short walk "
"Bendita Luna es un nuevo hotel en Mazunte. Es un espacio muy lindo, está bien pensado, las habitaciones son cómodas y espaciosas, la decoración del lugar es linda. Está planteado para el autoservicio en la cocina y áreas comunes pero hay personal que hace las habitaciones todos los días. Estuve poco tiempo pero me gustó. Está bastante metido en el camino al pueblo así que no hay que tener problema con caminar y poder convivir con los sonidos de los animales locales que viven en los terrenos contiguos."
"If you like to hear the crashing of waves and feel the warm breeze off the Pacific  this is the place for you.  The room is clean, spacious and the king size bed was comfortable.  There's a generous covered porch on the 1st floor and shared kitchen for 4 units. Spectacular views of the ocean from all rooms. There's a great low key vibe about the town that makes you want to linger. No shoes required at this place.  The owners were lovely. We'll be back."
"La predisposición del staff, la ubicación y la tranquilidad hacen que recomiende este lugar. Sin dudas se nota una clara ausencia del encargado de tomar decisiones. (Ejemplo: problemas de agua constantes, proponer la separación de los residuos pero sin contar con un lugar donde poner lo orgánico -toda la cocina apestaba horriblemente-)  Gran detalle en limpieza y entrega de toallas sin cargo"
Wir hatten via Booking.com vier Nächte im Doppelzimmer etwa zwei Wochen im Vorhinein gebucht. Bei unserer Ankunft weiß niemand von unserer Buchung. Seit über 2 Wochen kämen Onlinebuchungen schon nicht mehr durch. Mit Schulterzucken. Der Chef hätte Schuld. Auf Nachdruck (immerhin hatten wir über Neujahr gebucht) bietet uns die junge Dame für die erste Nacht Betten im Schlafsaal an. Dann beginnt die große Schlüsselsuche. In einem Sack hat sie mehr als 50 Schlüssel und probiert die jetzt durch. Nachdem wir end
" schlaflose Nacht. Als wir aber später wieder kommen, bemerken wir, dass unsere Betten bereits belegt sind. Die junge Dame, die unsere Betten auch anderen Hostelgästen zugewiesen hat, ist nicht mehr da. Dafür jetzt der Chef, der offensichtlich auf Drogen ist und überhaupt keine Ahnung hat, was vor sich geht. Wir haben gepackt und sind geflohen."
"Estuve dos noches en Casa maría, el bungalow está muy bien cuidado y el balcón es amplio, se encuentra en el camino a punta cometa, sólo para bajar al pueblo y la zona principal debes llevar una linterna ya que el trayecto por la noche es oscuro, y hace falta un ventilador mas grande y potente en la habitación ya que el que había era muy pequeño, los demás bien."
"If you’re the sort of person who wants to stay right on the beach and doesn’t shower much then this is an ideal place for you.  The good stuff: There’s two rooms above the restaurant with a private deck overlooking the sea where you can whale watch. The WiFi works well and the staff are so chilled they don’t really care what you do. The less good stuff: One room has a basic, grimey bathroom with a toilet which might not flush and instead of a door there’s a tiny, thin curtain whose only purpose appears to b"
"Nice hotel and restaurant by the sea. They offer good food and activities. I have to say you must speak spanish there. The wifi only works at the restaurant and not in the rooms. They offer laundry service, but then again, it helps if you speak spanish."
"L’accueil est efficace et le proprio est sympa. La chambre que nous occupions était grande, bien ventilée, mais sombre. Très propre. Le petit déjeuner, inclus dans notre tarif, était correct mais sommaire. L’hôtel est situé sur la rue principale, à l’entrée de Mazunte. Le village est petit . On peut tout faire à pied. Par contre du matin au soir, c’est bruyant, mais tranquille la nuit. Il y manque un bel espace extérieur où lire tranquillement à l’ombre."
"The staff seemed very annoyed at customers, for both the restaurant and hostel. Wifi usually doesnt work either. Rooms are not cheap, and sleeping in a hammock is not great, they do not provide mosquito nets. I recommend the other end of the beach to find much better places."
"Un hotel bonito, la atención de Esteban el dueño es muy buena, es muy amable y el personal tambien. Como áreas a mejorar sería la limpieza del baño, y poner una repisita para poder poner jabón y shampoo. Pero cuando regresemos a Mazunte si volveríamos a hospedarnos."
"Es una posada muy bien ubicada, tiene habitaciones frente al mar, con buena atención y muy accesible, las baños y regaderas compartidas no son de lo mejor, alquilar un cuarto con baño propio es lo mejor."
Es la primera vez que voy a Mazunte y el lugar así como su gente es muy hospitalaria!! La posada está muy bien ubicada y el precio bien! Excelente! Volvería a hospedarme ahí y sin duda lo recomiendo a la gente que va con poco presupuesto! Vale mucho la pena visitar el lugar! 
"Estuvimos una semana acampando bajo su palapa. Es una posada-restaurante muy familiar. El personal es atento y servicial. Es todo muy sencillo pero correcto. Quizás el único inconveniente que encontramos fue que apagaban la única luz que hay en camping demasiado pronto, por el resto..estuvimos muy a gusto!"
Lugar económico para pasar unos días en Mazunte. La situación es ideal ya que está en pleno centro y queda todo cerca. Las habitaciones son cómodas con lo justo y necesario. El personal muy amable y atento! 
"Definitivamente el mejor alojamiento en mazunte, la secreta caprichosa es la experiencia de vivir en mazunte, lo tiene absolutamente todo, excelentes instalaciones y excelente servicio por parte de todos los miembros de la secreta, altamente recomendable!!"
"This is some awesome pizza right on the beach.  Highly recommend it.  The hotel is beautiful and right in the beach.  I've not stayed there but this is a feast location, great people and killer food.    Mazunte is a great location and this place is ground zero.  "
"I stayed in Mazunte in December 2015 on a camping site next to the hotel DF and knowing then that my family was going to visit me in April I wanted to look for a nice hotel for the trip with my family. Hotel DF got my attention as it is right next to the beach, it looks modern and well maintained. So I went over there to get some information about prices etc. but the staff there did not seem to be interested to give information or aquire new customers. They only handed me a paper with their email address an"
"No vayan. Lugar engañoso, sucio, lleno de plagas de arañas y bichos. Reservamos con unos amigos por seis días y tuvimos que salirnos al tercero porque era inmundo. Tengan cuidado. El olor del desagüe se filtraba por todas partes, habían pulgas a las camas. No hay agua caliente ni presión de agua. Tampoco hay seguridad en los cuartos. Un horror."
I would like to make a reservation but can't find any way to contact the hotel Is the place closed down ?  Also does someone have an idea of the prices of the rooms ?  I heard that they had dorms but is there also private bedrooms ?  Thanks in advance !
"Stayed here for one night and the staff is very nice and helpful. The place is safe, clean and the price is decent. The place is not located seaside but it is about 10 minutes walking distance to the beach."
 dissappointing service has been right: It took three emails (in about three weeks) from my side until they answered. They responded that they have free rooms and gave me the prices. I was excited to finally get attention from them but after asking how I could book a room I am still waiting for an answer for over a week now.  I finally decided to not waste my money on a hotel that maybe looks nice but apparently offer a miserable service especially keeping in mind their high prices. I booked now another hot
"Lo único bueno de este lugar es que está frente al mar. Las fotos no coinciden con las que se muestran en booking, ya que el lugar está muy descuidado, los baños sucios con poco papel, la cama que me tocó incómoda y ruidosa. El chavo que lo administra se llama Ricardo y la verdad, en persona es buena onda y me ayudó guardando mi reserva después de que se me cancelara en la aplicación por un problema de mi tarjeta. Al final decidí no quedarme la segunda noche y moverme a Puerto Escondido, y acordamos que me "
"Hadn't booked in advance and was lucky that they had room for me in the end. I arrived in a huge thunderstorm that went on and off for a couple of days, but still really enjoyed those days hanging out with other travellers at La Isla.  Stayed upstairs in the large dorm room. Some of the beds are just mattresses on the floor and the mosquito nets have holes - but in Mazunte you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere that doesn't, especially at La Isla prices.  Free breakfast (scones and fresh fruit and juice and"
"We were during really high season between Christmas and New Year 2012. Everything was fully booked, and we had to camp during the first 2 nights, but the staff at Cabañas Abril were really helpful and managed to find us a room. We stayed in the cabañas during 4 nights, and it was a very good value for money. The place, as everything in Mazunte, is very very basic, but they manage to have all the basics in order. The place is clean, safe, and the price is decent. You do not need more in Mazunte.  Its disadva"
"Es un lugar muy cómodo, Lalo siempre preocupado por la hospitalidad de sus huéspedes regresaría una y mil veces sin pensarlo, habitaciones e instalaciones muy bonitas dacio de llegar y sobre avenida principal para llegar al centro de Mazunte caminando"
"Nice, clean two storey beachfront apartments with an amazing view on a beautiful strech of the bay. A clean pool for guest only and a restaurant with a small menue. The staff is friendly. We had a very plesant stay and will come again. There is dog poo on the beach, altough just on the public beach, not on the compound."
 have a great time. Be warned - everyone I know who visited the Oaxacan coast ended up staying much longer than they originally planned.

"Six cabanas on a hill overlooking the ocean. No onsite management, just a surly caretaker. We had booked 2 nights on Expedia. We liked Mazunte and wanted to stay one more night. Our cabana was available online but we could not book it because of  a 2-night minimum. So we asked the caretaker. He checked, and told us okay.  We returned from the beach after sunset in wet swimsuits, looking forward to a shower, to relax, and then go to dinner. Instead, we found that the caretaker had crammed all our things into"
"Excelente instalación, con muy buenas habitaciones, aire acondicionado, mosquiteros, wifi, tv y alberca impresionante 100% limpia Los encargados y personal todos muy amables y serviciales. Definitivamente un hotel que necesitas si quieres pasar un buen viaje con excelentes acomodidades y tranquilidad."
"We stayed here from 6th - 12th January. A beautifully clean room with air con and wi fi, and a wonderful swimming pool to enjoy daily. Our hosts were so kind and friendly. A wonderful stay - thank you!"
"I didn't actually get a chance to stay at the hotel because they didn't let me in with my friend and her 7 year old son! I called in advance and being a low season they said that they had almost all the rooms available but I didn't mention we were travelling with a kid, when we arrived the next day (8 hours later) and they saw the kid they were suddenly and misteriously full and had no space for us. They were rude when I mentioned that I had called before and they just turned us away saying that there are m"
 full. My companion searched online while I tramped the neighborhood. I finally found something by sheer persistence - I returned to a place that had already turned me down and they dug up a little room they don’t usually rent.  And you can bet the surly caretaker did not help carry our suitcases down the 135 steps to the street.  AVOID this hotel!
I reccoment this place to everyone!! Nice clean rooms whit ac! Beautiful design! Great pool! Great service! The owner is the most lovely man in mazunte! The cabanas are located 3 min walk from the beatch & are surrounded by the best breakfast places of the surrounding area! Amazing time  Greetings Sam
We passed this hotel a few times while in Mazunte and liked it for the nice fusion of a modern concept while maintaining a local touch with the palm leaf hatched roofs. We believe that places like this are important to keep the laid-back flair of this magic village and to offer a more upscale experience. We stayed at another rustic place but after a few very hot nights we looked for something more centric and definitively cooler. When I found the Cabañas Sicarú on booking.com and saw it had air conditioning

"This is the most special place I've been to, right by the beach. You can't beat the price, even for a private room, which is what we had. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, our room was very cozy and clean, and you get a free continental breakfast; they buy their coffee in town, and it's some of the best I've had in Mexico to-date (not included, but what's 15 pesos?!). Also, La Isla had some of the cleanest bathrooms I have ever encountered, and in the 10 days we were there, there was never not a"
"The hotel is located against a steep mountain, looking at the sea. Spacious, clean and modern “ecological” rooms....(you know what that means, right? No AC!) But the architect thought about the heat!! So he constructed those rooms with two “walls” with wooden blinds.... very nice looking, but without any moskito net...., so any crawling or flying insect can join in! And there’s no wind blowing!! So forget about natural cooling. So, someone thought about it, and put 2 fans in the room... it is so spacious, t"
" hour La Isla has, which was greatly appreciated.  All in all, we're looking forward to coming here again and again and again."
" preferred to sleep in the outside hammok! The restaurant is floors upstairs...or downstairs! It depends where your room is..... with a magnificent cook, and view! But frankly, the amount of stairs that you have to climb up and down, just to est or swim at the pool... is to much!"
…
"We like to travel light and not to leave a big footprint. So I am glad we couldn't find the place we were looking for and ended up at La Isla. Wonderful crew, interesting people from all over the world, simple, clean and well kept facilities and of course the wonderful location at the beach in Mazunte. We found a lot more than what we expected and we are thinking about coming back already."

"Not a single place on this planet, let alone Mexico, would dare to treat paying customers the way these guys do. Total desmadre, chaos, complete ignoring of common sense or any business deal they make with you. Their only focus is making money, and they won't stop at ripping you off while providing ZERO care for you, and complicating your life with non-stop inconvenience. The place itself is lovely, but definitely not worth its price, and the owners are greedy, disrespectful people. Do not get involved with"
"As said in other comments... the place is amazing, but maybe a bit overpriced considering the service. We arrived quite late (6pm) hoping to be able to enjoy a cocktail and the sunset. After we climbed the 150 stairs with no way to communicate with the staff to get some help, we actually enjoyed the amazing view ... from the lobby, for more than an hour. Staff was not warned that we had booked a room, so the room was not ready, and they really struggled to find our reservation... We were asked several times"
" compares to nothing else in mazunte. The room did not have all the mentioned features but staff brought it when we asked for it (music, etc). The view from cuarto triangulo is ashtonishing, you'll never want to leave the place.  The pool was not really clean either, but ok to swim. For the price you'd expect a little more of attention on these details.  Contrary to other comments below, i must say the personal in charge was very decidated, he cooked us breakfast, brought us hot water for the night since it"
…
"Great place! This is such good value for money if you share for two people, as Mazunte is pricier than you think.  The views are just incredible, well worth being so far uphill. The pool is always clean and the staff are just so friendly and will help you with anything. Speaking Spanish will help as they do not speak much English.  Fully recommend to stay here. Also close to Punta Cometa where you can see the most amazing sunset."
"We made a reservation to stay at OceanoMar for 3 nights with the understanding that the hotel had air conditioning, as indicated on Trip Advisor. When we arrived, we discovered that the rooms do not, in fact, have air conditioning.  Whether this miscommunication was the fault of Trip Advisor or of the hotel, I cannot say. However, I am glad that we had not put down a deposit, and I wish that Trip Advisor had accurate information about the facilities at OceanoMar. I was really looking forward to staying ther"
"We truly enjoyed our stay at OceanoMar. It was very family friendly (kids 10 & 13) with a great pool and a restaurant on site. We did have to get two rooms for the four of us, but the cost was still quite reasonable. The view is magnificent! Staff was super friendly and helped us with transportation and tours.  It is walkable to town with a coffee shop at the bottom of the hill where one can grab a frappe or drink.  The rooms were very comportable with windows that allowed for a good breeze and a small pati"
"If the owners spent just a bit more it would be fantastic. The setting and view is gorgeous. the rooms are nice and with not much effort they would be perfect. place needs a little upkeeping. Staff (of 2) is very helpful and amicable, but they are gone by 3 pm. Finished your  water bottle and Need  more water...walk at least 10 mins on dirt road up and down a hill to get some. We changed rooms, the small one is tiny, the suites are much better. Housekeeping takes forever to clean your room and watch for you"
"It really is paradise here So relaxing by the pool with a lovely view The en-suite room was big,clean and comfy The food was magnificent Note there is no wood fired pizza oven The staff were incredibly helpful and thank you Dorian and Lydia The guests seemed to mix well Be aware if you struggle to walk you will need a taxi to get you to and from from Mazunte The taxis are cheap and readily available"
"We traveled to Mazunte with our 4-year-old son to relax in the warmth and visit with lifelong friends who return to the town every winter-- this year their usual rental house was not available so they stayed at OceanoMar, and of course it was the natural choice for us too.  It couldn't have been more perfect! Our room was lovely and spacious, our king bed was very very comfortable, our private balcony with hammock perfect for lazy afternoons, and the view of Merimahita beach was breathtaking. Every morning "
" lasagna!!  -- and prepared with a smile. My son spent hours a day in the gorgeous and well-maintained  pool, it was easy to monitor him in the shallow wading section, and he's come home a bona-fide swimmer as a result.  The staff let us borrow a corner of the fridge for leftovers and kid snacks which was much appreciated. We spent many lovely evenings visiting and playing cards up at the restaurant after hours with the baby monitor set up, and not a care in the world. I would go back in a heartbeat!"

My wife and I just returned from a two week stay at OceanoMar.  We have traveled a great deal in Mexico but this was our first time in Mazunte.  We were thrilled to find this small seven room intimate gem of a hotel located in a beautiful setting.  OceanoMar reminded us of other places in the world that we had been to thirty years ago. It was so wonderful to find a place that was so charming and had not experienced the kind of over-development one sees in so many places.  The rooms are beautiful and from ou
" really good.  For my wife and I what made OceanoMar so special was the hotel staff.  Dorian the hotel manager with his team of Ledia, Lety, and Zoila were so fantastic in making us feel like this was our home away from home.  Dorian also arranged for my wife and I to get massages in our room from Nancy.  OMG was she ever fantastic.  I can't say enough good things about OceanoMar. It truly is an amazing place.  We have booked our return visit for this fall."

"Great Accommodation We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Casa Tierra Viva. Patti and her husband  were great hosts who were very welcoming and intent on making our stay comfortable.   The room was very clean and comfortable with 2 great beds and pillows. The air conditioning was a great asset.

"The Casa Mazunte Tierra Viva is a work in progress, meaning they are in process of building a restaurant, pool, lounging area and adding some character. However, it is already a very nice place to stay.  Our room was large, clean with a very large window that kept the room bright (but not hot thanks to the shade).  Very quite property and air-conditioning available if needed.    This is one of the best situated hotels in Mazunte.  It is located just off the main road that takes you to Playa Rinconito.   The"

"We loved staying here. The location is perfect - two blocks from the beach. It is close to EVERYTHING and if there is something you can't find, the owners live on-site and are very accommodating (they even bought us flan:)  Our room was large and with a well-equipped kitchenette. The bed is comfortable. The  hosts are fantastic people and I have no hesitancy in recommending this site."

The room is quite large with a kitchen, table, bed and two additional seating/sleeping areas. The kitchen is well stocked and includes a coffee maker and blender. They also provide kitchen basics such as salt, coffee, oil, and sugar. Small terrace out back has no view but does have a hammock shaded by trees. Good wifi, and the recycling system, free "
This location has everything you want or need. Activities for adults and kids. Multiple hot tubs.  Great staff!!!  Resturant food and service all extraordinary. The team started taking care of us before we arrived.  Making sure we had specialty tems stocked in our room before  arrival.  Great week. 
"We stayed at RANCHO San Lucas 5/21-5/28. Daniel, gavino, and lupita were so fun with the activities every day. They were great at engaging everyone! They had activities for all age ranges and my daughter loved the arts and crafts."
"When I tell you that we have been to Grand Solmar Rancho San Lucas a lot in the past two year, I am not joking.  To the point where my husband bought a four bedroom so we couldn't go four times a year.  We have been to Rancho four times in the past year.  Each time getting better and better.

Same goes for Manny, the bell cap manager, who tests everyone like family and always remembers our name. We love you guys!"
"Came here with a group of friends and immediately fell in love with the staff! Francisco has been helping us out by the pool and has made this trip absolutely extraordinary. He knows what drinks we need, before we ask. Don’t get me started on the poolside games, you don’t wanna miss out! Make sure to say hi to Jorge while you’re here, he is the best!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed the taco night.  Incredible food,  we had to get seconds on a few items. Service was friendly,  efficient and fun. Nelson really helped us to enjoy the evening.  Can't wait to go back!"
Francisco and Jorge at the Lagoon bar are the BEST. Wonderful service and friendly. I came here with some friends and did not know what to expect. Very happy that the service has exceeded my expectations. After only a few days with them I already know that I would love to back.
"Wow what a nice experience we had in Una posada Mas. It's pretty, green, clean and comfy ! Martin and Irene the owners are very welcoming and answered all our questions. It's like literally 3 minutes walk to the Beach and all the best restaurants of Mazunte. I 100% recommend this place to anyone going there ! "
"I tried out a few different places in Mazunte, and this one was by far the best.  It was the most conveniently located, very clean, eco-friendly and wonderful owners.  It is has everything you need. I especially recommend Una Posada Mas if you are traveling by yourself and looking for a place where you feel at ease and comfortable, but also not looking for a party hostal. It is a great price for what you get and you won't want to leave!"

"Definetely one of the best posada options in Mazunte! A minute's walk from the Rinconcito beach and as closed as it gets to the Mermejita beach. Literally next to the best bars and restaurants which during Easter and New Years can be a bit noisy. The posada itself is beautifully designed with spacious rooms, all with open walls and en suite bathrooms. The owner is extremely friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!!"
We came back to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary and our week was amazing!  The entire staff made our entire experience.  Fernada the pool concierge and her team were so helpful and attentive.

 resorts and will say this resort is the BEST. Looking forward to coming back!!!
Very charming place. Clean! Quiet and good privacy. Very nice and fair priced for the area. Excellent location...just down the road from the beach and restaurants. An English speaking worker and wifi were definite plus's for me. I would highly suggest staying here if traveling to Mazunte.

It's pet friendly, there are dogs and cats, which I love! There were plants and hammocks to relax in the terrace. Laura was always nice at us and helped us with anything we needed. The prices were really attractive despite it was high season. Loved this all eco-friendly place, I would strongly recommend it <3"

"From the first inquiry, Martín, the owner was prompt and helpful. The hostal is just off the side street that leads to the beach, about 3 minutes walk away. The hostal itself is very well maintained, with a nice communal area.

It was a lovely trip! We stayed only one night but I wish it was for a longer period! I'll surely come back in this bambou-style hotel. The location was perfect; we were only a little bit surprised by the price of the room when we saw it but it is still a good deal. Have fun!

"Thanks to Una Posada Mas for a lovely and tranquil three-day visit to Mazunte. My room was clean and comfortable, with excellent beds and a hammock for my afternoon nap. It was really more of a covered, enclosed balcony than a proper room, which was great for soaking up the atmosphere and vibe of the town. Although the room is open to the outdoors, the beds are surrounded with mosquito netting in good condition to keep the nighttime critters away.

I would like to start with this review by saying if you're looking for glamour, luxury, high maintenance, and royalty vibes this hotel is for highly recommended for you.  Yes it's expensive but you absolutely get what you're paying for. You will be treated as a King or Queen once you lay foot of the property. The property is outside the city of Cabo if THATS okay with you and you can't call a Uber to come pick you up from the hotel because of safety"
 hotel it's much cheaper. and no swimming in the oceans because the currents are too strong and will swallow you up. But there's an infinity pool with a nice view of the ocean.   The welcome greeting was majestic we had a drink that tasted good and a hot towel and tour of the place. The scenery is sooo beautiful. From the pools to the layout to the eatery and much more. The rooms is jaw dropping gorgeous. And don't get me started on the showers and that big soft bed and the balcony. I Can speaks for hours i
"I stayed here in May 2022 and my main review is that the front desk/concierge/customer service at this resort was incredible. They were prepared to answer any question or help with any situation 24/7 and it was so appreciated. I particularly wanted to commend Jose, who seemed to be available throughout my stay and always welcomed each and every question I had and gave me a clear answer or offered to figure it out for me. The text communication was particularly handy. Would definitely stay here again!"
"The location of this property is fabulous -all within walking distance to the marina and shopping. Close to great spots like The Office or Sur Beach House. The design of the entrance way and lobby is very green and welcoming. Love the work lounge space along with the pool table and bar area. Thank you to Ivanna and Tabatha at the coffee juice grab and go a great spot to get a detox or immunity boost smoothie or latte. Also check out their merchandise like candles, totes, etc.  There are 2 pools the garden a"
" at the pool. We all loved the tacos, chicken fingers, mango salads and guacamole and chips at the poolside food truck- shout out to the chefs for an amazing lunch everyday! Mathias, Arcenio and Kevin were always at your service with great suggestions and amazing customer service. All wonderful personalities. Bruno at the pool area was also very welcoming each morning.  I'd also like to thank Christian, Javier and Andrea at the front desk for their attention to detail and guest services. Christian thank you"

"This property is amazing! Fernando the bartender at the pool/beach bar was fabulous! He provided us with great service. Mauricio set us up with great pool chairs, amazing view and towels. The service here is 10/10. I highly recommend the pork quesadilla and the Madre Ancestral."
"This resort is amazing!  The residence was perfect for a family get-away with the adult children.  It was beautiful and had a spectacular terrace with a pool and a large living and dining area.  The staff was so helpful and friendly starting with assistance prior to our arrival and through our entire stay.  Everywhere we went on the property we were greeted with a friendly hello.  Thank you Javier, Aaron, Jose, Cindy, Christian, Arsenio and Fernando for making us feel at home.   And thank you to Aaron for o"
"Great Great Service!!!! Edson,Eduardo. Diana. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Would definitely return to the resort again and would highly recommend to friends and family.   See you next time!"
"Edson, Edwardo and Diana were absolutely fabulous.  Definitely will be back.  We went with couples to celebrate our birthdays.     The team here made us all feel welcome and we had food and drink in hand all points."
"What a place to celebrate friends turning 50. The experience was nothing less than perfect however the service is what stands out above all else. Our new friends at the pool (Edson, Diana, Fernando and Eduardo) made this an experience to remember!"
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay at 1 Homes. The property is stunning and the staff is beyond attentive to any and all of your needs. The pool staff was always friendly and serving up the most delicious drinks. Absolutely everything on the food truck menu was delicious and fresh. We loved the BBQ day and special evening with sushi by the beach. Every server, bartender and concierge we came across went above and beyond for our family. Eduardo, Edson, arcenio, Diana, Aaron and many others, gracías for a tr"
From start to finish the experience was amazing. The pampering starts right away with Jesus and Estela helping us throughout the spa and providing mimosas and a nice relaxing area. We got a couple's massage with Yaneli and Lucy and both my husband and I enjoyed the amount of pressure and the fact that they would stop to check on us. Then we got a chance to swim in the salt water pool and cool off. Definitely recommend!
"We returned with a large party (multiple rooms) for spring break at Grand Solmar, and as always everything was wonderful.  Juan Carlos and his entire front desk staff did a wonderful job, both at check-in and during the week - including helping make it a magical birthday experience for our (adult) daughters. David spent a long time with us at check-in, working to arrange our rooms so that we were all close together - and then handle all the details of check-in, meal plans, etc.  We had a great poolside expe"
" eat, and we tip our hats to both Dani and Manny for consistently great experiences there. We also enjoyed eating at Brisas, where Jonathan went above and beyond (staying past the end of his shift to serve our party, even when several family members had to reschedule). Miguel always goes above and beyond to get the special foods that some in our party prefer - and to help us arrange for a magical birthday experience for our daughters.  We look forward to every return visit. The entire staff is consistently "
…
"The great management and staff made our family vacation remarkable! Juan Carlos Salgado was able to position four rooms in close proximity. So convenient! The housekeeping staff always made sure the rooms were spotless. Thanks to Manny and the great bell staff for expertly handling our luggage and transportation needs.  Francisco Triano at the pool performed his magic keeping everyone's drinks fresh. He was awesome as usual! The Sunset Spa massage therapist, Karen, was wonderful with her relaxing techniques"
 staff and management deserves them all!
…
"Grand Solmar sets the standards high with its customer service. The resort itself is extremely clean, even down to the details of the sand being raked. Upon arrival you will be greeted by Manny and his team of bellmen.  These guys are great, and are great source of information about the resort as well as within Cabo.  Manny went beyond the call of duty for me last year and  helped me propose to my girlfriend. Even with everything he had going on, he took the time to ensure it all worked out as discussed. It"
Me and my fiancé came to the resort for a long weekend and had the best trip. Rogelio provided the best service and was very welcoming. I would 10/10 recommend the playa grande and look for Rogelio on The Ridge he will guarantee you have everything you need.
" Cabana’s for several days.  We got to know Juan. He made an effort to stop by several times a day to ensure everything was going as well.  Any concerns he really wanted to address… and he would also make an effort to stop by with some chocolate drizzled pineapple. Yum! Juan really wanted to make sure that the experience at the pool was above par for us and it was.  Even though this resort is on the Pacific side of Cabo and gets some extra wind at times, the resorts service and its employees make you feel p"
Rogelio and Angel are my favorite bar tenders ever! The ridge has such amazing pools and views. I recommend the Ridge to anyone coming to Cabo. The location is perfect cause you can walk to the beach or to the city very easy.
…
"we had axel as our waiter. drinks were cold, food arrived fast, Axel was attentive and we appreciated the good service!! He recommended the quinoa tomato salad and it was super yummy and refreshing! Would definitely recommend!"
We went to the ridge and it is highly recommended and has great food and bartenders. The rooms are clean and all of the cleaning people are great! Rogelio was my waiter a few days and he was super friendly!
"Edgar is the absolute BEST! AMAZING. He went out of his way to make our stay the best. Hes warm and weloming and always has a smile! We can't wait to come back and visit. If you come to Playa Grande, ask for Edgar!"
"This was our fifth stay, and this place is consistently amazing. It’s quiet, which we love, yet close to the party scene, which our twenty-something kids appreciate. It’s not an all-inclusive, though I think there are some all-inclusive meal plans you can get. The views from these villas are to die for, the service you get is outstanding, and you are clearly valued as a guest by everyone on the staff. We’ve definitely found our happy place and we’ll be back!"
"Can’t say enough about the staff… beyond amazing . Jorge and Blanca were beyond attentive, friendly, fun and accommodating. Food was amazing. Pool was a little chilly … thank you Playa Grande.. see you next year !!"
Axel was amazing. He was the best! Had drinks delivered quickly. Very courteous and nice. Best service I have ever received. He brought our food and drinks just as we asked. Gracias Axel! We will definitely come here again
Playa Grande in the absolute Amazing Los Cabo’s has the most spectacular staff! From soup to nuts you are catered to as if you are living the life of Riley! The Ridge has the Best of the Best! Jorge is there for everything you need whether it be a beverage or a towel always with a smile 😊 Blanca & Miguel are super amazing ready and willing to make you experience beautiful and wonderful. I cannot say enough on the courtesy & just absolutely great service. Cheers 🥂 to The Ridge @ Playa Grande!
Positive: - very nice garden and pool area - nice rooms with comfortable beds - one of the few beaches in the area where you can actually go into the ocean - close to Cabo San Lucas  Negative: - shared balconies for most rooms - 'Kids eat free' promotion has so many restrictions that it's almost more of an annoyance than benefit - Hotel charged 7 passengers a total of $154 for a shared taxi to the airport that did not have air conditioning so everyone arrived sweaty prior to their trip back home
"My wife and I traveled to The Ridge at Playa Grande with another couple for a week long vacation. The entire week, Jorge was always timely on checking on us for any need while we lounged by the pool. Sometimes I would just be looking around and we'd make eye contact and he would wave to make sure if I needed anything or not. He had fantastic drink recommendations and impeccable service, all complemented by a friendly demeanor. Highly recommend!!"
Villa Estancia was an incredible resort. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the suites were amazing. My bf and I traveled to Cabo for a week- we stayed in the One bdrm ocean view suite- well worth the upgrade to ocean view. We also opted for the all inclusive package- although it didn’t include alcohol the food was great. There is an endless amount of restaurants to choose from (across all three resorts) ranging from walk up and order to pool side service and more formal fancy sit downs. The r
"Our time at Playa Grande, and more specifically the Ridge, was absolutely incredible. We stayed with another couple for a week in a penthouse. Views of the marina and ocean made for a memorable time. Best of all, the service at the pool was incredible. We opted into the all inclusive plan and were well taken care of by Jorge. He was incredibly attentive, friendly, and really made the experience five stars. We can’t wait to come back!"
" all inclusive package but it wasn’t really a bother as there were many many options that were included! Additionally for the restaurants that did require reservations, they were easy to come by and often we called same day and they were able to accommodate. Highly recommend a trip to the spa at Villa del Arco next door- the facilities and services are amazing. We will definitely be coming back! The only minor complaint is that we did not know we’d be sharing our (expansive) patio with a studio room next do"
"Great service, awesome staff….Rogelio and Cirilo provide great friendly service every day. Awesome views, great food, drinks and views. Definitely coming back. Close to downtown, the beach, and other activities."
…
We had an amazing time at Playa Grande Resort. At the Ridge pool side our favorite bartender was Raciel. So nice and he always remembered what we were drinking and knew our room number! Very happy guy and was patient with us when we tried to provide our order in Spanish.
"Alberto is the best! He remembered everything about us by the third day, highly recommend. The food at Villa la Estancia is very good especially La Parilla and La Casona! The drinks arent very strong though so be warned that you will be asking for doubles just ti get a buzz"
"Loved our stay at the Villa La Estancia! The staff were super friendly and helpful during our visit. The on-site restaurant, La Casona, was incredible too! The staff there treated us like royalty, literally. Angela, Adrian, Luz, and Fredy really went above and beyond to make us feel special. Oliver at the front desk and Angel were also especially helpful in making sure we enjoyed our stay. The entire resort was squeaky clean and we didn’t even see any bugs! The entire staff was friendly and attentive. And t"
" split up and placed in rooms on opposite ends of the resort. However, we spoke with Oliver at the front desk and he was able to get us fixed up into an even better suite."
"My wife and I stayed at Hacienda Beach Club this past week, and it was exceptional.  A few things: -From the time we arrived to the time we left, the experience was delightful. -The staff was professional, service minded, and attentive. -Our room was wonderful...clean, nice, and huge compared to a typical hotel room since these are homes that are owned by private individuals. -The ambiance was classy (not a party crowd). -The amenities were great, including the gym, the cafe, the spa, the infinity pools and"
" beach, and we kayaked to the arch in 15 minutes. -The food onsite was great; it's a little pricey, but it's quality and make it easy just to eat onsite.  The only downside was that the during the afternoon, the party music off the ocean can get a little annoying (all the party boats), but there's nothing the hotel could have done to prevent...it's part of being in a great location.  Thanks to all the staff (Victor, Mauricio, Miguel, and so many I'm not calling out) that were across the bar great.  We'll be"
We had an amazing trip during our stay. The resort was a safe and had plenty of things to do. Our butler Gerardo was hands down the best. He made sure everything went smoothly and that we enjoyed ourselves while on vacation.
Great week at GSRSL. Beautiful resort! Perfect service by all the staff. Special call out to Daniel and Lupita. They were outstanding😍 Fun activities for everyone. Resort was clean. Rooms were new and nice. Would come here again.
…
"What an absolutely beautiful setting for a girls trip!  There were six of us staying in one of the villas, Roberto was our concierge.  He was SO accomodating!  Answered the phone on the first ring and had a van waiting to take us to the golf course or downtown.  He arranged two private chef dinners that were amazing!  We enjoyed our private pool and hot tub with a view of the ocean but also the bar pool! All food was fantastic.  We enjoyed cocktails at Cocina del Mar and took in the waves crashing against t"
From the moment we got here we felt so welcomed by the staff.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful. We loved hanging around the kid pool area with our two children. We were immediately greeted by an amazing waiter named Baltazar. He is always so attentive and friendly. He helps carry our bags to our chairs and grabs towels before we even ask. He is such a blessing to have during our stay. He makes coming back to our favorite place so enjoyable!! So thankful for everyone at Rancho!! Keep up the amazing work!
"The food, the views, the service, the rooms, EVERYTHING was incredible. My husband and I came on our mini moon and the staff was so accommodating and kind. We felt so taken care of. Luis, Nicolas, Miguel, Tabatha, and everyone else at the pool greeted us by name each day and made sure we had everything we needed. Manuel and Victor with the concierge were so helpful, we were able to get everything we needed with just a text! The beach is so clean and fun to swim in and the pool is beautiful. We basically had"
" and the pizza was so delicious!!  The beds were comfortable, but be warned - no top sheet!  Each bed had a duvet cover but no top sheet.  I am certain however, if we had requested it, one would have been provided.  If you want to get away and feel fully pampered, Esperanza is where you want to go!"
Wonderful attentive staff. Really fun water aerobics with Lupita!  My grandkids made ceramics with Itzel. There is so much to do at the resort besides eating and drinking. Thank you so very much for making our family vacation so memorable!!!
"We loved the Hacienda! It is definitely the best resort in Los Cabos. The staff was amazing. Sergio, Luisa, Jose and Gabriel made our experience much better. We can’t wait to come back and see everybody"
…
"Amazing ocean view seating. Great service and an excellent meal. Jose Juan and Amahl were great waiters and the food was perfect. Topped off with live music made for a romantic evening. Try one of the flaming coffees, you won’t be sorry. We will be back.❤️"
Sergio made my day by taking care of my family. It’s my husband’s birthday and he made it special by being attentive. I wish more people were like him. Sergio went the extra mile to serve us. He is the type of person that would be great as a manager
"Luis, our concierge, made our experience extra special. He attended to every detail and is always so friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  The staff made our anniversary amazing (I cannot share what they did as I do not want to ruin the surprise for others, but let me say it was the most customized service we have ever experienced! Thank you Esperaza for making each of our visits more special than the last. Oh, the Cooking with Friends class on Thursday with Chef Alex was spectacular!!!   Studio Eminence"
"Best view , pool and drinks. They bring food and drinks to you by the pool. Great service and friendly staff. Thanks to Ivan Jeanette and Alexis! Great time and super relaxing.  A must if visiting Cabo.  We would definitely come back to visit."
"Carlos B. and Miguel were the best waiters by the pool. They were fabulous, always smiling and making our trip so much more fun! Beautiful get away. Mauricio was extremely friendly and helped with getting paddle boards and kayaks. Best service and best views!"
" managed the obstales effortlessly. She was flexible and professional. When we went the next day she made the preview session so nice, no pressure, and again so flexible. We are thrilled with the results ( not easy when you are not young). Thank you Esperanza and Mercedes for creating lasting memories we will happily display in our home."
We know Daniel and Lupita and we are happy to come back and be with them doing all the activities We are happier because they do everything nicer  We like the aerobics and the karaoke  So when you come here make sure to do the activities with Daniel and Lupita  They will help you with everything that you need
"The staff including Manny, Miguel, Ullisis, Nelson, and others are very focused and make you feel very welcomed! I highly recommend the Hacienda as we have been coming here for years. The Cocina & Cantina restaurant is always excellent. Jeff S."

"Our family dinner is was exceptional. Jose, Carlos and the rest of the staff were not only attentive, they were like family. I feel honored to spend time with my culture, but at home with the best of the best served and hosts"
"Everyone at Hacienda was so kind and helpful! We had a great time hanging by the pool and Manny, Miguel, Nelson, Sergio, Luisa and everyone else made our trip so relaxing! The food was delicious and the resort was clean and beautiful. Hope to be back soon!"
"We just returned today from a four night getaway at Esperanza.  We go to Cabo a lot, but this was our first time at the resort.  Wow!  It was beautiful, to start with...from the rooms, to the landscape, to the beautiful hotel itself, perched on the edges of the natural cliff like it belonged there. We were there in May, which is the windy month for Cabo, and we had some 14 mile an hour winds for a portion of our trip, along with the full moon, this caused enormous waves to beat upon the rocks in the ocean, "
"Itzel, Daniel and Ulises are the glue to make sure the pool is lively. What an amazing group of individuals the bring life to a sleepy afternoon. They connect to the children, adults and everyone between. On a lazy recovery day you have to make sure to see them. Activities the unite all souls."
"This is an all-around incredible hotel. It takes a village for every aspect of a stay to be 10/10 and the Hacienda does it. Its location is the best if you want amazing restaurants in walking distance, the best beach in Cabo, and privacy while being near everything you could possibly want. The actual rooms are wonderful too. They are tastefully decorated in traditional Mexican décor, cleaned to perfection upon arrival and with the daily service, and you can even drink the water from the faucet. The service "
We had a wonderful wine tasting at the Pacifica with the sommelier Antonio. We went through 5 different Mexican wines and all of them were lovely. He also set up cheese pairings and it was really fun to go through all of the different flavors. We work in the wine industry and go to tastings regularly. This one was one of our favorites we've been to in a long time!
" Palappa. I fell in love with the roasted brocoli with a curry sauce (appetizer) and at the palappa, the honey mustard and ginger dressing on the wedge salad for lunch. We took a gold cart over to Estrellas (at the far end of the resort) for dinner one night. It is a beautiful garden setting, and totally unique. Our waiter, Marcos, was so welcoming, charming and great for service and a smile. I have gluten and dairy allergies, and found everyone in the resort very good at helping me get what I needed withou"
We had the Al Pastor served at our table. Antonio and Alfredo presented and served the meal perfectly. We had a wonderful dinner and an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended food and the view is outstanding.
We celebrated my mom 70 bday and had so much fun¡ Hugo and Samuel were the best¡ thank you for being great hosts. Hugo went out of his way to make sure we had a great time at the pool.  Samuel made sure we had a great spa experience.

"Maria,Alexander y Balthazar took care of us and did an awesome job taking care of our beverage needs.as soon as we got here the wait staff was on top of things. I'm glad we has this group to wait us they were fast and attentive."
"We stay at the Residences several times a year.  We've always had an amazing time.  One of the highlights of staying in the Residences is having access to a butler.  The last few times Guillermo has been our butler.  He's friendly, attentive and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy and have everything we need to enjoy our vacation.    We'll be down again in a few weeks with our adult kids and will make sure to request Guillermo again!"
"Hugo, Samuel and Francisco gave us excellent service. Recommend this resort! Great food and entertainment at this resort. The rooms are very nice and clean. The food is very excellent. Lacy game thank Pacifica for your excellent service."
"You know a trip has been very special when you come home and day dream about it. We had an amazing week at Vista and The Residences. So much packed into a short 10 days…with early morning sunrises, Easter at the chapel, workouts at the Vista gym, coffees and espressos before breakfast at Marias - with our Claudia always knowing our order- lazy days at the pools, pickleball in the afternoons, lovely sunset dinners, karaoke nite, evening dinner shows and music, the list goes on and on. But far and away the be"
"Best time ever!!!!! The customer service is unmatched. I feel like i have been here a million times already. This is definitely the place to be, no matter the time of year! I will be back next month, I love it here!!!!"
"We arrived in Olas and felt right at home - small, cozy, with a warm and special touch! The rooms are simple but very functional and the small details you find from the roomservice are done with love. There is a nice small pool with sunbeds and hammocks  right in the center of this small hotel and a self-service bar/restaurant with an outdoor kitchen where they also serve breakfast. The Cerrito Beach is only a 2 Min walk from the hotel which is offering beachtowels, beachchairs and sunshades for all guests "
" Oscar, Jose Antonio, Naomi, Manny, and so many others! I am so thankful for the time we get to have there and I really look forward to coming back."
"Hugo took us up a couple mile journey to the Quivira lighthouse. Hugo was very knowledgeable, funny and made sure he kept all the vermin at bay (no sneks!). I definitely recommend this excursion for those who love nature, to hike and take pictures."
Hugo was the best activities director at Pueblo Bonito Pacifica . Very nice guy and informative along the hike we took up to the lighthouse. He accommodated our date and time for this activity with no problem. Highly recommend. Go with Hugo!
"Olas de Cerritos is a gem of a find, located in the heartbeat of Los Cerritos. Part of what I love about this area of Baja is the raw elegance. The beaches are wonderful, the people are friendly, and the costs are very reasonable. The rooms are  basic and that was my expectation - we were only in the room to sleep. The breakfasts were DELICIOUS, they provided beach accessories (chairs, towels, umbrellas, surf/boogie boards, etc.), the room prices are reasonable, and the vibe is relaxed. I spent time working"
…
"Very fun! And good exercise with Sergio and Hugo. The day is beautiful. Ana in the restaurant has wonderful service. The food is great, sushi and Siempre were great. What a wonderful time! Thank you Pueblo Bonito Pacifica for all you do."
"I LOVE this hotel!  This is my second time staying at this location, and I cannot say enough good things about it.  The rooms are basic, the breakfast is delicious, and the location to the beach is priceless.  Plus, you have Barracuda (tacos) right next door!  You cannot get any better. Our weather wasn't as hot as we would have liked, but we requested the hot tub on the coldest day and it was perfect!"
"This was an absolute delight. I have been to Cerritos 3 different times and this was by far my favorite place to stay yet. I was solo, so the size and price fit me perfectly, but it would be great for families or couples as well. The breakfasts are terrific, the beach chairs and umbrellas, bicycles, hammocks, boogie boards, etc all for you to use at the beach just about 400 yards away. The pool and pool are is lovely, the parking is secure and right next to the building. the location in relation to the beac"
"Our accommodations, food, and service were great. We especially liked working with Clemente. He did a fantastic job taking care of us and our guests. We had a leak in the kitchen when we arrived and it was repaired within the hour. We loved the food at The Baja Oyster Bar and Barolos the best of all the restaurants. Villa was clean and housekeeping was top notch."
Awesome fun Hugo and Sergio Were wonderful perfect actors exercise and music was great. The next time we come to Pacifica it will be for the water aerobics because they were wonderful and very inviting and active
Great place to stay . Super friendly staff. Very close to beach . Super surf. Breakfast was yummy. Room was very basic. Clean . Car Rental was a disaster Beware Great little store down the road Kimberly’s
"The staff here is wonderful Guillermo is the best host around. They always go out of their way to make our stay amazing. Our anniversary was the day we got in, but every dinner we booked came with an anniversary celebration that we didn’t know was coming. It as a memorable experience. Hacienda Encantada is top notch. Beautiful resort, the Villas are amazing, quiet and peaceful."
Our stay in Cabo was amazing.  We played pool volleyball and the bag game. The activities and company come highly recommended!  The food and service were fabulous. We wanted to stay even longer but will be back soon.
"The room was spatious and bed was good. Breakfast was made freshly in the morning. The lady who made it was very kind. Besides the kitchen lady, we didn’t see anyone of the hotel during our whole stay. There wasn’t anyone to welcome us our check us in upon arrival. No explanation of the area, facilities or anything. We had to call them and they said the key was on our room door. Also upon check-out we didn’t see anyone. We just left the key there and apparently they just booked the money from our creditcard"
"What an amazingly perfect Vacation with Friends at the Hacienda Encantada Residences!  A Beautiful 4 bedroom villa with all the amenities we could only hope for.   We recommend to everyone visiting the Residences to request Our butler Friend Enrique and housekeeping Friend Gabriella to add finishing touches to your stay.     Until next time Hacienda Encantada Residences….sending Peace, Love and Positive Vibes from North Carolina."
Hugo was awesome! Very friendly and played ping pong/pool volleyball with us too! Rene was a great help too! Overall they were very helpful and allowed us to enjoy our time here in Cabo carefree and get some good drinks along the way!
"We have been coming to Pescadero for years.  Although I have not loved all the changes over the years, this new gem is perfection. A block from the beach, next door to tacos, you literally cannot get any better!  We found this hotel tranquil.  We were a little worried about safety reading that long review from Christmas, but we found no issues.  We never felt our room or belongings at risk. The pool was a perfect treat after a day walking around in Todos Santos! Breakfast was delicious and coffee always rea"
"Being fortunate to stay in this beautiful 3 Bedroom Villa, with its own pool, hot tub, built in barbecue, fire pit, fountain, lounge chairs, patio and balcony is the ultimate luxury!  But it gets even better!! You have your own Butler!!! Our Fabulous Butler was, CLIMENTE!! A delightful, bright, articulate, professional, good looking, nice young man who served our every need! We could not have asked for more! Making reservations, bringing something we may need, making recommendations, solving issues, changin"
" the beach with Mario’s Surf School!  They also do SUP tours to La Paz which are to die for amazing!  Sophie on the beach has the best massages.  The sunset view at Hacienda Cerritos is spectacular, you will pay for it in the dinner prices.  We found this well worth it for a treat.  The best fish tacos are on the highway at Tacos Emmanuel.    I love Pescadero, I promise you will too!"
" home and have to fend for ourselves after being treated with such attention and kindness!! I highly recommend staying at The Residences in the Hacienda Encantada!! You will not be disappointed Especially, if you are lucky enough to have Climente as your Butler!!"

"I had my money ($850) stolen out of my room. The owner reacted rudely and suspiciously. Video from the security cameras for the time frame in question were deleted.   Our stay was great until someone stole US$850 out of my room the last night I was there. Maria, who only worked at night had asked me 2 days before to pay my hotel bill. Since my friends read something on their booking confirmation that one has to pay in US Dollar (I have a foto), I asked if she wanted me to get cash from my room. I had a cred"
We are frequent visitors to Cerritos and this was the first time staying at the Surf Residences. The condos are very new and have wonderful views of the ocean. We rented one of the penthouses and so enjoyed the huge roof patio with fire pit and the outside kitchen. The unit was stocked so well with anything you might need for cooking and entertaining and had beach chairs and umbrellas. The beds were super comfy and had nice linens. The concierge was incredibly responsive and met us upon check in. Having a r
"Todos santos is an amazing mostly undiscovered escape. It is safe and beautiful.  The Surf Side Residencies are really nice. We walked around with the door to our room  left open and had zero worries. The pools are beautiful and kept very warm and clean. The bar is fun and all the staff are beyond friendly.  The concierge went above and beyond. We had great champagne, house tequila and more all given complimentary.  The studio 56 suite is a resort of its own.   I promise you will not be disappointed."
"I had a thought about the big bad wolf blowing down the house as I ascended the little stairs with railings made of sticks, but under the rebar and twig railings is polished concrete, wrought iron, and brick. This is a lovely hotel, tiny and uber-functional, a mix of industrial and organic…but with caveats.   First, steps. You’ll be encountering a lot of them in Todos Santos, and Casa Morelos is no exception. I walked up from the bus terminal (about two blocks) and that meant navigating steep steps. I cheat"
We rented Casa Loba for two nights at the end of our trip to Baja. It exceeded all our expectations and was without a doubt the nicest place we stayed at while visiting Baja. It was just stunning. Cerritos was the perfect and much needed alternative to resorts that saturate the landscape in a nameless town further south down the coast. Those hold zero appeal and way too many people for our taste. While we stayed at Casa Loba I don't think you can go wrong here as the layout of the units are the same and the
" a problem for me as a solo traveler staying a single night, and I marveled at the clever use of the small space with its handmade details. The private balcony is a wonderful spot to watch the sun set or enjoy a morning coffee brought back from one of Todos Santos’ upscale coffee shops.   Third, noise. Casa Morelos is at the center of a small town with a heavy tourist presence, so the upside is a convenient location. The downside is the serenade of nearby restaurants and bars. Earplugs come with the room, a"

" have a bar adjacent to the pool and a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner or you can have it sent up to your condo if prefer to eat on your own private patio.

We have never been one to like all inclusive resorts.   We previously stayed at Auberge's Esperanza at Cabo and ventured out to restaurants since my wife and I are extremely picky about food.  Since we haven't been away for over 2 years because of COVID  and we just wanted to relax and not think about going out for meals we decided to take a chance.    Grand Velas was amazing.    The service was top notch.  The breakfast and lunch buffets were terrific.  They had jamon iberico at a lunch buffet which was a 
"I'm writing this review to prevent others from having the experience I did. I am not one to write bad reviews, this is my first, but when management is completely unresponsive you have no other recourse.  On a positive note the design of the hotel is lovely, and it is filled with interesting outwork.  The first room we were put in was dark in tiny (we had to hop over our suitcase to get to the bathroom), and the receptionist was helpful in getting us into a different room. But everything else...the internet"

The breakfast was pretty awful, which was hard to understand in a town so filled with amazing food.  You are only provided with one small refillable bottle of drinking water.  You can ask staff to refill it and they will, when they are there, but the kitchen is locked at night, so if you want water past 7 you did to go to the store.

Todos Santos is only 20 minutes away, so we went up there everyday for some great coffee and food. The Cerritos Surf Residences were fantastic - the facility and staff are both top notch. We ate on site at least one meal per day, sometimes at the pool, sometimes in our room. Awesome food at a good price and great drinks. They have hotel quality amenities, but with a"
"One word to describe it - “soulful”. The 4 room boutique hotel 7 minutes drive from the old town away from the noise of Todos Santos Centro, is newly built, using only sustainable materials that’s all organic from the curtains,  towels, rugs and bed sheets- to lamps, furnitures, toiletries and bathroom fixture! Bathrooms and sinks used polished concrete. Strong water pressure. Toiletries are organic as well as the coffee and tea. Amazingly the power source is 100% solar- bringing the heat to your shower.

"My family and I have just returned from a three week stay at Grand Velas in Los Cabos. I had a certain amount of concern having not stayed in many all-inclusive places, and certainly not in one as big as Grand Velas, but we all thought that the accommodation, facilities, and setting were first rate. More particularly, the food offered in the different restaurants was excellent and plentiful. Each of the chefs at the restaurants went out of their way to create special meals for us and ensure that they had wh"
"The property itself is beautiful with great views of the ocean and everyone working there was really nice.  But note: this property is building phase 2 next door and there are quite a few other construction projects going on around this property. So there is a lot of noise and dirt flying around.  It's unfortunate as my husband and I upgraded and spent more money to stay in the PENTHOUSE VENI, VIDI, AMAVI suite but we couldn't even sit outside or enjoy the roof top deck. We had to keep the sliding glass doo"

To the owners of this suite, the queen mattress in the guest bedroom is really comfortable but the king mattress in the master bedroom was not comfortable at all, no support. I believe it was one of those mattresses in a box.  We were looking forward to a serine quiet getaway to Cerritos but that was not the case unfortunately "
" other hotels and resorts, I don't think the value can be beat. The only knock on Cabo is the fact that you can't swim in the water because of the undertow, but at least if you're interested in walking the beach, there's miles after miles to do that."

"Far and away the best experience we’ve ever had at a resort. The service, the food, the room, the whole time spent there went far beyond any expectations! Everyone at the resort bent over backwards to make sure that we were having the best time. We especially loved the adult pool!"
"My husband and I went to the Grand Velas Los Cabos for a business trip, but it felt much more like a luxurious vacation. We just arrived home last night and wanted to share our experience. The resort itself is stunning, the lobby looks like an art museum and really sets the stage for the kind of luxury you are about to experience. All of the food and drinks were amazing, and of course, the location can’t be any better. Honestly, everything we ate and drank here was 5+ star, as well as the service…everyone t"
"Easy, quick check in. Road is a bit rough getting to the hostel. There was at least one family with small children which I’ve never witnessed in a hostel before- this one accommodates!   We stayed in a canvas tent which was a fun change from the rest of our trip- no sound proofing though. Roosters & dogs at 2am, neighbours snoring etc- earplugs were provided which helped. Would stay here again if on a budget trip- todos santos itself is larger than we expected but very cute!"
" similar. It was nice to be greeted with so much kindness throughout our stay.  After we checked in, we were given a personal concierge, Victor Villaseñor, who was the nicest, most thoughtful and engaging man…we enjoyed getting to know him and truly loved all the recommendations and information he had for us.  He checked in on us throughout the day, each day we were there and would sometimes find us at the pool just to say hi and see if we needed anything (dinner plans, spa, resort activities, etc). He was "
"We stayed in one of their tents. It was fine for our needs / good given it was indeed a tent. Spacious, clean and with a comfy bed. The toilet facilities were clean and good order. In fact the shower was hot and faultless. The staff were very obliging / helpful and gave us some excellent advice about where to eat / go locally. My one small concern was the lack of somewhere safe to leave valuables .... what could I expect in a tent? "
The only place i can stay was that hostel. Very friendly place good vides clean kitcen Very beautyfull veranta i dont have something negative really tent are super the rooms are ok service super  Thank you chris from greece with love

"10/10 hostel. Exactly what is needed.  Friendly hosts (Pablo) and a clean hostel with good kitchen and nice showers bathrooms.  Options for doorms, private fancy tents outside or camping as my girlfriend and I did.   Good price at $10US per person for our tent or $20 for dorms.  Locations great if you have a car. Decent if you have a bike for todos santos. 5 min walk to corner store or 30 mins to middle of town walking.   "
"Preface: I booked through Airbnb, which made the process easy and allowed for straightforward communication with the host, via the app.   I stayed in the canvas tent for just one night. Spacious enough for 1 or 2 people, clean, comfortable bedding. Plenty of lights and outlets (!!). Just the basics...this is a hostel, so don't expect anything over the top. Loved the outdoor showers with private stalls. Only con was walking through the sand right after showering, Maybe just bring better shoes than the sandal"

Big shoutout to the owner, who drove late in the evening to pick me up, after being dropped off by the bus. The hostel is off the main stretch of town in a very residential neighborhood. I walked through here early in the morning- perfectly safe. But, at night, with little lighting on the dirt roads and all of my baggage in tow, I just felt safer riding in a car.

"We got the place as a vacation rental for family and friends after missing so many gatherings during Covid. We originally saw it on Airbnb, but it’s more like a hotel where staff is there from 10-6 and you have daily housekeeping if needed. I have really conflicting feelings about this place, because the location and accommodations were better than anything we could have dreamed of. But the property manager, Anabel, was a nightmare. I can't confidently recommend this place to others because she was so rude "

The teepees are bigger than photos show. We loved the common spaces inside and outside for everyone to hang out.

The manager Anabel is very impolite and liar.  I organise a yoga retreat in Pachamama and she sent me the menu only 5 days before and everything was wrong. She didn’t change the meals and she attacked me. I tried to contact the owner. He saw my message and he didn’t answer… The place is too expensive compared to the quality of the food and the service. They didn’t change towels as they promised.  I don’t recommend this place.   Several people had stomacale infection
"This place is beautiful and relaxing, but since we went on our own and not with a yoga retreat of any sorts, there was not dining offered aside from breakfast. The road to the property is quite bumpy and it’s 20 mins from the main town, and thankfully we had a rental car to go out to get food. The teepee is cute but we had a hard time sleeping both nights for some reason. Pool is amazing and enjoyed the peacefulness of the property. The staff was kind overall too."
"In January 20 20 I hosted my third yoga, meditation and transformational retreat at Pachamama. I don’t have enough time or words to tell you all the great things about this property.

This is the 3rd time I have come to this property and every time it gets better and better.  It's cozy a quiet. Set close enough but far enough from the cute town of Todos Santos. There's a ton of privacy throughout the property with plenty of places to chill and hang out. There's also a ton of variety offered from the hotel. Some days we wanted to hang and get spa services and others we wanted to go out on adventures. The best part was that they took care of it all from start to finish.  THE FOOD! And I ca
" communicative. The responded to all emails in no time.   I have brought groups here yearly, 25-30 people at a time and everyone keeps coming back. I can't recommend this place enough."
"So great clean hotel, friendly staff, but dirt bikers!!!   How many times can people yell “”cannon ball!!!” And jump into the pool?   Bikers bringing in 6 packs (cans) to drink by the pool (solo)?   Loud obnoxious guests.  The hotel needs to chose their guests."
"We stopped to have drinks at the bar, sat outside and enjoyed ourselves. We ordered the chicken nachos and they were delicious. So relaxing and very clean. There was an amazing pool in the center of the hotel. We would love to go back and actually stay at the hotel."
"The hotel is clean and located in the center of town. But the rooms are very basic. Except for the mattress, there are no other real furniture in the room. Everything is made out of concrete including the bed frame, nightstand, table, sink etc. The room is very small. The only windows are facing the pool and it gets super loud. Not a place you should stay for long and it's certainly not relaxing.  Luckily we were only here for 1 night. Todos Santos is really a place to just drive by for a quick stop. I woul"
We stayed one night.  Very reasonable price and it was much better than expected. The pool area is small but updated and really nice.  We could definitely hang out there if we were staying longer.  The staff were very helpful.  There is an attached bar that you can order drinks from.  We had breakfast there the next morning which was good.  The room was comfortable and a good size.  Multiple rooftop sitting areas.  You can easily walk to art galleries and restaurants.  We would definitely recommend.  It’s a
"We stayed here for a couples get away and to explore Todos Santos for the first time.  The hotel was cute, clean and charming.  The rooms are simple but yet still provide you with what you need (except a hair dryer - bring your own).  The staff were very welcoming.  The pool is centrally located in the middle of the hotel but it was very quiet.  There are roof top patios available for lounging.  The hotel has a restaurant and bar (actually two bars) attached.  Hotel Casa Tota is located in the city center. "

"We didn’t stay at the Hotel Casa Tota, but it had a lovely clean aesthetic- and beautifully set around a marvelous pool. Next time we will! But my husband and I stumbled upon the restaurant and bar last night and had great drinks and dinner there. Tommy, the bartender/server, was awesome. Friendly, efficient, and all-around great guy! Highly recommend it!"
"Casa Tota is a small boutique hotel.  It is quiet, beautiful, clean, modern and no frills.  If you are looking for a quiet oasis, this is for you.  If you are looking for something bigger and lively then this might not be the place you want.  The pool is lovely and they also have a roof top patio area that has a great view and is very relaxing.  It is conveniently located in the historic downtown and you can walk to everything very easily.  The historic downtown is small, quiet and charming.  It is very pea"
" So even if you aren't staying at the hotel, it's a great option to eat.  Next door is a cute bar called Alchemia which has live music on Friday night.  Don't worry, they are quiet after 10pm so it should not disturb your sleep :) ."
"We stumbled upon this gem of a hotel when we went for a quick overnight 'vacation within a vacation' to Todos Santos during our recent trip to Mexico. First let me say that there are only eight--as in 8--as in ocho--total rooms in the entire hotel, which means even when the hotel is ""packed,"" you still feel like you have the place to yourself. The pool is big enough for our whole family to enjoy, there's a hot tub right by the bar, the food is great, and the rates were relatively inexpensive. Plus both of m"

Everyone there is fabulous, bending over backward to ensure our stay was enjoyable. Manuel is the bartender / server / house guy, and was incredibly polite. One of the cooks had her son assisting her and he helped bring out the food. It felt like a family operation in the best possible sense, and we were part of the family.   I'll also add th"

The jacuzzi/hot tub was amazing and super relaxing. I would definitely stay again if I return to Todos Santos"

"Stayed at Perro Surfero with my two children (ages 7 and 10). We had an outstanding experience, would definitely recommend it, and are planning to return. Nice room - simple and very clean. Great open air kitchen with dedicated space for each room.  Good proximity to the beach. Great work space. Best of all, Mao and Jime were lovely, gracious hosts - helping us out of a jam with a rental car and making us feel at home. Highly recommended."
"The layout and amenities are super cool...great place to lounge, cook in the communal kitchen or get work done over the reliable WIFI.   Also,  a really good spot to meet other travelers and surfers.  Much more fun than your standard/boring hotel."
"I came to todos santos to recharge and the Perro Surfero was the perfect place for a home base. Mao and Vivian were such lovely, gracious hosts and the hotel was a wonderful oasis. My room was awesome and the different spaces you can use throughout the property are also wonderful, from the roof terraces, to the fire pit, the the gym and my personal favorite, the hammock over the pool.. All so thoughtfully curated. I hope to return soon!"
"Mao and Vivian are golden, such great people. My room was a great size.  Comfy beds and pillows.  The room and all public spaces are very clean and well maintained. People were social and a lot of common spaces but never loud hanging out at night. A good mix of people passing through and long term stays. It’s so great people were always trying to extend the time, including myself. Coffee every morning.

"This place was recommended to me by some friends in Mexico City and I was really impressed. The setup was cool, I liked the hotel/hostel vibe but with more privacy. Lots of space to socialise with other guests but also to have more private dinners. Mau and his staff are great. Would highly recommend!"
"We stayed here twice, the hotel was clean and so inviting. Mao and Elizabeth were really helpful, even set up a horseback riding excursion. Would definitely recommend! The kitchen it great, they have water, beach chairs, coolers, umbrella all to use for no extra charge, as well as the fire pit."
"Stayed here for a week recently. It’s a clean, cozy, and friendly place to stay. Very happy with my stay! The pool is on the small side, if that matters to you. It’s on a quite street and has a great kitchen and space for groups."
"Found this hotel randomly while doing a bit of research online for somewhere nice to stay during a short trip to todos Santos with my husband as a part of our Honeymoon. Everything here met my expectations and then some! Mao, the owner, pays incredible attention to detail and was very friendly and helpful. The day we checked in happened to be my husbands birthday and Mao even left us a nice bottle of wine waiting in our room as an arrival gift and made us dinner reservations at this amazing spot to celebrat"

"I wanted to book a stay in a small, cozy hotel in a small, cozy beach town for a solo vacation between leaving an old job and starting a new position, and this place couldn't have been more perfect for me. I stayed for 5 nights and left feeling rejuvenated and well cared for.   I stayed in the twin beds room, which was adorable and well-suited to my space needs. In the mornings, you're treated to a delicious homemade breakfast in the courtyard and unlimited coffee, and from there you can either head out for"

Also, now they have the boat experience at Cortez sea. With the combination of the hotel + the boat, you will hace you the whole experience for your visit to baja."
"We only got to stay here for one night as we had stayed another hotel on the beach during our visit to Todos Santos.  Staff were very friendly and the rooms were very nice, with good quality bathroom products.  The rooftop pool area was nice to relax with a cold beer at the end of the day (the water was cold though).   Breakfast was good, but the coffee drinks could have been better.   Overall a nice stay."
" shops and bars 5 minute walks away. Getting to the beach is a bit more of a hike; it took me 40 minutes, but I turned it into a Real hike up on the cliffs, which was gorgeous and super fun.   One thing: I checked out reviews before I flew over, and I have to tell you, people are not exaggerating about the barking dogs nearby. They do NOT let up all night, there's a ton of them and they are loud!   To prepare, I brought ear plugs with me (if you have a small head/ears like I do get child sized earplugs. tru"
"Brand new resort with a whole lot to offer those looking for something a little different. Fresh, adventurous, eco, friendly, and fun! Luxury travel yes...but this is not a frou-frou resort. The Paradero blends in with it's surrounds. Immersed and beautifully blended into the farm community, mountains, desert and ocean that encircle it. I admit, we were not sure what to expect and when we arrived it was a lot more ""natural"" than expected. Meaning the grounds are mostly dirt--groomed of course but not going "

"What a wonderful hotel. If you're like me and avoid sterile hotel chains, you'll love this place. The rooms are cheerfully and comfortably decorated to reflect the local culture (great tiled walk-in shower), the breakfasts are delicious and enough food to last most active people until late afternoon.

It's well worth a slow stroll around the grounds to catch the thoughtful design, decor, and landscaping (it used to be"

"As one reviewer puts it, Guaycura, the hotel itself, is ""friendly and charming"". The rooftop bar and swimming pool have some amazing views and the location is perfect to visit Todos Santos itself. Particularly interesting is a boutique just down the street which has all sorts of esoteric, pretty, and special, knickknacks from Mexico and the world.  Where Guaycura really comes into its own, though, is at its restaurant (El Faro) and its Beach Club. Located a few minutes south (towards Los Cabos), on a gorgeo"
" an earlier breakfast on our last day when we needed to leave early. These hosts delight in making a great stay for guests. The barking dogs and crowing roosters are all part of the Todos Santos experience, so you can use the provided ear plugs if needed. If you are unsteady on your feet like I am you might want to use a cane to get around the uneven and sometimes steep grounds. Like many places in Mexico, this hotel was not designed to accommodate those with mobility issues. Oh, and check out the book in y"
One of the most magical hotel experiences I’ve ever had. There were so many wonderful aspects - from the people who worked there to the adventure experiences and lush rooms  - but I have to say the food was maybe my favorite part. Also the catamaran experience is a must!  Cant wait to go back.
" too. The ceviche Todos Santos, in particular, is the best I've had... and I've had a lot of ceviche ;-).  Todos Santos is a very special destination that seems like its set apart from time and Guaycura is the best way to experience it."

"Beyond the incredible architecture and use of space. Paradero lives up to the hype. A place where experience and adventure become the day to day norm. My favorite experience, the food. Paraderos Omakase is a must! Their creative menu paired with incredible drinks and mexican influence makes it unique."

"We spent 8 days in the Santa Barbara suite! The room was super spacious! It was clean, bright and welcoming  Housekeeping arrived at the same time daily and kept the rooms spotless.   The beds were super comfortable, the best I’ve ever slept on in Mexico. I would say this room has two full sized beds, rather Queen though.  The location was convenient to downtown.  Easy walk to lots of restaurants!   Mini-supers were near by if you wanted to buy groceries.   The pool was clean, quiet and surrounded by beauti"
"Great place with super kind staff. We rented out the whole place and again, everyone was so kind and accommodating.   Yes, the dogs are incessantly loud, but that’s entirely out of the control of the hotel.   Completely walkable to the cute streets of Todos Santos.   Would recommend that the owners purchase white noise machines for the rooms. That may help."
Amazing design and the food is also incredible. All of the experiences are worth while. The taco tour is absolutely a must. There is also an omakase experience that the amazing chef can organize. Overall just spectacular.
"My sister and I stayed at The Guaycura and had a great experience! The booking was very easy and we were also able to book some excursions (local hiking guided tour, swimming with whale sharks in La Paz) that really made our trip fantastic. Salvador was very responsive over email and helped set up all our excursions.  The hotel is very cute inside with well appointed rooms and tasteful decorations. The best part of the hotel is that they have a rooftop bar and swimming pool/lounge area where you can sit and"
Wonderful location that feels secluded while in the middle of everything. Easy walk to the town playground and ice cream shops. Absolutely loved the accommodations for our family with plenty of space for everyone. The pool was our kids favorite place to hangout.  Felt like our own personal paradise.
"Very cute hotel. Unfortunately, it is across the street from two houses that have over 15 dogs that bark INCESSANTLY from 4pm to dawn.  It isn't possible to sleep through it. They give you earplugs, but that is not nearly enough.  Too bad, it could be a great place to stay, but if you can't sleep through dogs barking all night pass on this one."
This hotel is an experience Ive never had. The arquitecture and contact with nature is unbelievable.  The food is as going to a Michelin star restaurant every meal. I really recommend this hotel to every person that is planning to come to baja.
"The hotel is very quaint and charming and the room was lovely. Beautiful decor throughout and wonderful curated art collection.  However, our room had no hot water for the 2 nights we were there.  Maintenance was prompt to come when called but did not resolve the problem.  We were told that we just needed to run the water for a few moments however we ran the water for a least 5 minutes and did not get anything beyond tepid water.  The breakfast was vastly overpriced ($45US for 2 places of huevos rancheros, "
"The main building just in front of the toll gates on the highway, has basic rooms, but other rooms are available in two other areas in town, one just around the corner and the nice ones which they advertise with a little further down that same road.   So we stayed in what they called the King Rooms, which are 4 rooms on a parking lot close to the main road. a bit strange location for a hotel.  But all worked fine, there is a gate, security cameras, and although there is a lot of noise from the main road, I "

Both rooms were lovely.  Well appointed and both had large bathrooms with huge showers.

For an overnight stay a good place, because it is very clean and if you travel onward,  a superb location, close to the main road.   The wifi is good by the way.   Not many COVID rules and regulations inside the hotel.   Rooms are 500 MXN per night, a bit over the top for such a basic hotel."
"My husband and I stayed at Hacienda Todos Los Santos for 4 nights. We had such an excellent stay. This is a true boutique hotel. The property is absolutely gorgeous.   The location is 5/5! It’s pretty much walking distance to everything in town, but it’s still tucked away in its own little oasis. At night, you can hear the waves crashing from your bedroom. It’s very pleasant to listen to.   Cleanliness is 5/5. Everything was spotless. The cleaning ladies clean every little nook and cranny every single day! "
"Absolutely loved our memorable stay at Paradero! Sublime setting, fantastic, welcoming staff, and wonderful restaurant. We really enjoyed our bartenders, Brian and Pablo, who shook up wonderful mezcalitas, educated us on the prep of drinks and origins of Mezcal. The sous chef Jorge and fermenter, Israel were so talented and prepared every meal from the heart as did Doña Paola."
Welcoming and accommodating staff at intimate motel and clean Cabañas. Excellent seafood and fish at restaurant. Powerful AC and wifi reception in rooms good. Close to Gulf and beach area as well. Swimming pool clean and well-maintained. 
" from their oven and perfect latte's.  At night, look for MJOL pizza (Miguel) in the outdoor Plaza Amigos on mainstreet.  Both are great examples of young entrepreneurs who are contributing to a ground swell of great food in this charming small town.   It was so nice to stay in a place that felt like a relaxing home away from home.  "
" so seamless. Luis from the front desk walked us through everything. He was so warm, welcoming, and kind. The cleaning ladies were marvelous! The groundskeeper work tirelessly day in and day out to maintain the beauty of this property.   Amenities 4/5. The pool was amazing!  I do wish there were more loungers though. There weren’t enough for all the guests. The in-suite bar area with the mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster (fully stocked with coffee, tea, sugar, creamer, silverware, plates, etc.) "
"This is my 4th visit to Hotel San Cristobal and every time I go fall more in love with this property and Todos Santos.  The hotel is beautifully tucked into a cove off a stretch of dirt road.  We typically never leave the property but if you do there are many good restaurants now in Todos Santos.  Benno the restaurant at the hotel is by far the best option though .  From breakfast to dinner the food is fresh, innovative and delicious. We usually get an ocean view room and love the size and view from the roo"
"We didnt stay at the hotel but we ate at the reataurant. We ordered the soft crabs  (jaibas), fish and fish fillet and all was awesome. Fairly priced and delicious cooking.  Order just one dish as the plates are big so no dessert. Congrats to the owners."
…
" walking beach .  The water is too rough to swim in. It’s beautiful to watch the fisherman fish off the shore.  At night from our balcony the star gazing is amazing.  The best part is the service at this hotel,every waiter, housekeeper, front desk person is extremely nice and go over and beyond to make our trip perfect.  Although I’ve in the past rented a car and drove the 45 minutes from the Cabo airport, I used Todos Santos Private Transportation this time and had great service !"
"We stayed for 4 nights in the Suite San Juan Diego - we loved it. Super spacious, beautiful design and has everything you need. The location is great, just on the edge of town, easy to walk to all the shops and restaurants. Luis, who runs the hotel, was very helpful and got us set up with a COVID test for the flight back (he arranged a time and they came to the hotel room - fast and easy) and also a trip for us to Isla Espiritu Santo (recommend!). I swam at the pool once and it was very enjoyable. As other "
…
 felt like they had to buy everything at the hotel  (food/drinks)…I would much rather get some snacks and drinks at the store and just stock up the kitchen! We would definitely come back here in a heartbeat.
"This place is an absolute dream. My mom had been twice and recommended it to my husband and I for our honeymoon. We went over New Years 2020-2021 and the covid protocol is on point, there are very few people staying there (small hotel), the scenery and rooms are astounding and the staff is so incredibly nice. Dolce absolutely made the experience. She is phenomenal. I cried when I left since she was just so very nice. I can't wait to go back!"
…
"Really quaint Hacienda that gives you the true Oasis feeling.  Huge clean and nice rooms with large private patios.  Gorgeous pool.   Friendly staff.  Super mellow.  Location is right in town,  would definitely stay there again.  Taco restaurant at the end of the street is super grubby!"
"The hotel was absolutely beautiful, but what really impressed us was the help we got from Daniel at the front desk. He was incredibly kind, understanding and went out of his way to assist us. We were here for a wedding and it was absolutely stunning, wonderful attention to detail. Great rooms! Still, Daniel's assistance was the highlight. Thank you!!"
"We spent six nights at HSC with our two adult kids. We had a fabulous time. The hotel is beautifully situated on a gorgeous, quiet beach just a ten-minute drive to Todos Santos. The hiking trails are incredible. And so many whales swimming by! The property is really lovely. Everywhere your eye lands is a thoughtful design detail. Yes, it's instagram friendly, but it's also legitimately pretty. Our rooms were simple but spacious and comfortable. We loved the sitting areas and indoor/outdoor showers. The comm"
Lovely setting of 12 rooms around a decent sized pool and covered table areas with a cafe. Rooms are generously sized with comfortable beds. AC worked really well but not needed during the day as fan and cross ventilation was enough. Plenty of hot water in the large shower. Importantly it had screens over the windows and doors going to the terrace or balcony. A class act. Good food at Don Guillermo resteraunt on the beach to the left of the tourist pier. Street has a galleon ship at its start. Very chill re
" local fisherman Agustin (truly spectacular ceviche and sashimi). But the best part were the staff, who were accommodating, attentive, and gracious. I felt very well cared for - it was just the relaxing break our family needed after a very difficult year. Muchisimas gracias!"
"What a sanctuary. A beautiful garden light comfy clean rooms with wonderful paintings, lovely pool, super hospitable hosts. The beach is about a 10 minute walk away and we had it to ourselves. Great cafes on the beach with delicious seafood. Wonderful pelican watching."
We reserved in the hotel based on the images and info provided by Google Maps. We did not have high expectations and the place turned out to be of a higher quality than expected. Highly recomended. Will be back! It really feels like Mexico!
…
"My husband and I have wanted to stay here for a while! We booked 3 nights after staying at a different hotel in downtown Todos and we have been underwhelmed. The food and location are top notch — but the service does not match what you pay for. They did not clean are room 2 of the days we stayed there, there are not enough lounge chairs to accommodate the # of guests they have, they care more about the photos one might post to Instagram than actually providing top level service.   The food is outstanding an"
" here. Will not stay here again,"
"El servicio eléctrico fallo necesitaba estudiar, conectar mi lap y mi celular. Solicite mi reembolso o al menos parte de este para poder irme a otro hotel y me lo negaron rotundamente, la recepcionista hablo al ""contador"" y este ni siquiera quiso hablar conmigo. Total que había gente en recepción ya q la habitación era un horno. No hubo solución de ningún tipo, nadie con poder de decisión dió la cara ni avisaron nada sobre cuando se reestabelceria no tienen generadores para caso de emergencia. Pésimo, no va"
"The owner and personal is very nice and helpful. Even though they didn't speak a word of English they did everything to help us, giving us directions and calling taxis for us. The standard och the rooms and hotel is very simple and a bit worn down. Don't expect anything fancy at all but they did clean the room and change the sheets every day. The function of the WiFi was back and forth. "
"Так уж получилось, что в этом отеле мы были единственными постояльцами. Соответственно не работал ресторан  входные двери были всегда закрыты на замок. Номера небольшие и уставшие, душевая лейка льет на пол рядом с унитазом, что не совсем удобно, но постельное белье чистое и качественное. Есть парковка."
"Hotel con buena ubicación, cerca del malecón y cerca del mercado donde se puede comer muy bien a buen precio, el hotel con habitaciones bien, en cuanto a los servicios del baño, solo proporcionan jabón y una toalla por persona, cuenta con estacionamiento con cupo limitado a la vuelta del hotel."
"En términos generales el hotel está bien, podemos ponerlo como ""bueno"" sin llegar a ""muy bueno"", el aire acondicionado funciona bien, el hotel está limpio, lo que no explicaron es que los domingos no se asea la habitación por que es el día que el personal descansa, la puerta de la habitación costaba trabajo dejarla bien cerrada, como puntos buenos es un lugar tranquilo sin ruido, cuenta con restaurante y wifi."
"Nos hospedamos ahí tres noches. Son como departamentos, tienen una cocineta, refrigerador de buen tamaño, sala, comedor y la recámara. Admiten mascotas (con un depósito de $500 ) solamente no permiten que las dejes solas en la habitación.  Hay bastantito ruido en la calle por la mañana, si te gusta dormir después de las 6, lleva tapones para los oídos.  Tienen un buen protocolo de COVID-19, todo está super limpio y bonito.  Cuentan con estacionamiento y elevador. El personal es súper amable y está cerca del"
"Me hospede por 2 noches en este hotel, la habitación básica pero con lo necesario por el precio. Super tranquilo. En definitiva durante mi próxima visita a ciudad del carmen me hospedaria de nuevo. Si solo buscan un lugar para dormir se los recomiendo. "
"Be sure to stay here if you like a breakfast buffet swarming with flies, toilet paper like sandpaper, towels from Goodwill, housekeepers who knock loudly on your door at the crack of dawn so you will wake up and leave (they have no Do Not Disturb signs, so they have a pretext), rooms with no hair dryers, and auctions that go on outside at deafening decibels til one in the morning.  Otherwise, do not stay here, ever."
"Spotless clean and very good breakfast!  Francesco was very helpful and the only english speaking guy. The free Hotel Shuttle Service was very comfy to me. The AC doesn't really did a good work, this should be maintained or replaced. "
"This is a local hotel, close to the pier with older rooms and furnishings.  The beds and the linens were thin, and the lighting was non-existent in the hallways throughout the building at night. The main hallway on the main floor is open to the back of the building and therefore outside to the parking area. There was not A/C in the room I was in for late June."
"This is the 2d La Venta Inn property I have stayed (Villahermosa ). The Carmen property is newer. But, the ambiance is the same. Check in was friendly and efficient. They had my ""Booking.com"" reservation  readily available.   I was billed exactly to the centavo as depicted on my Booking.com reservation  The room  (King size bed) was exactly as described and depicted in the online ad.  The free breakfast  consisted  of two fruit juices, two cold cereals, indigenous fruits, yoghurt, cottage cheese, nachos wit"
 The area is not highly industrialized. It is very quiet. Many good restaurants are convenient by  a short taxi ride (35/40 pesos)  La Venta Inn Ciudad del Carmen will be our first choce for me and my novia.

"Es un lugar tranquilo, pero le falta mucho a la higiene, tanto en las habitaciones como en las áreas comunes. El gimnasio es pura pantalla no están en buen estado sus aparatos. La piscina estaban sucia, y el yacusi no funciono."
"First off, the hotel tries to look very modern. It looks nice in the lobby. The mattress in the room is a bit worn in with a bit of a sag on the edge is was sleeping on. The wifi in the room didn't work too well on my iPhone. In the lobby it works much better. There is no bar. The book in the room states there is. The price for the night is slightly less then competitors. The shower has a hard time keeping a consistent temperature. We are moving to the Hampton Inn for the last two nights of our stay. There "
"This property appeared to be be relatively new.  It had a great location close to the beach and some good restaurants and ""watering holes.""  Access to midtown and the central market are not far.  The main highway to Campeche or Tabasco is not far either.    The free breakfast was tasty especially the eggs cooked to order.  There was a variety of juices and, of course plenty of coffee.  The property has a lovely pool area.  The staff was great and extremely helpful.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Hatte das Hotel im Internet für 800 Pesos die Nacht gebucht. Am Ende musste ich 950 Euro zahlen. Mein Spanisch war zu schlecht, um herauszufinden warum und englisch konnte dort niemand, darum hakte ich nicht mehr nach. Das Zimmer war ok, sauber, mit Fernseher, Van und Klimaanlage. Klein aber fein. Aber leider kein Safe vorhanden.  Absolut ungünstig für Raucher, ich musste immer ewig weit runter bis in den Innenhof latschen, und nichtmal dort gibt es jegliche Art von Aschenbechern. Im Gegensatz zu Küchenscha"

"A great place to work as it is very well equipped by an office station and several meeting rooms. When you get to your room you can see the marvelous ocean view and the mattress is memory foam (you will want to have that bed at home). The breakfast has a vast selection from fruit, chilaquiles, any style of eggs, and waffles. There is a fitness center, although it is well equipped I recommend you go to the beach for a walk. It will take you 6 minutes from the front desk to the ocean shore, something distinct"
"I'm surprised by this hotel's score. Here's my experience.  The room has a TV, fridge, bed, and bathroom facilities. You share the 'desk' with the TV, and the chair puts you way below a comfortable working height. These are minor gripes. Here's why you shouldn't say here:  1. The shower will not provide hot water. After 15 minutes, the best I got was just the right side of uncomfortably cold. 2. Contrary to the summary, no one here speaks English. 3. If you use room service, order your food 2 hours before y"
" can hear is background noise. Once the phone is picked up in the kitchen, it's just dumped on a table. Now go to reception and order. 15 minutes after that, you'll get a call to tell you that they don't have the dish you ordered. Of the six listed, three were unavailable when I stayed.So choose the inevitable floury thing, beans and chilli. One hour later, your 'food' will be delivered - almost warm - dumped in a styrofoam box with a plastic fork.  Anywhere would be better than this."

"I got in very late with my wife and baby.  Expedia had messed up our reservation, but the staff was friendly, fast and efficient.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Great pillows.  Breakfast was good, friendly service and many options.  Rooftop pool/gym/lounge was nice with a great view free washers and dryers, which is wonderful when traveling with a 1 year old. My thanks to the staff."
"Stayed for one night only, ate in the restaurant and had breakfast.  Staff were friendly and welcoming and the room clean and comfortable.  I ate dinner in the restaurant and there was a very wide selection of Mexican, American and European dishes.  I had salmon and it was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. Breakfast was buffet style with a huge choice, all fresh and beautifully presented. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
"Along with noise well into the night, the pool area from morning till night is a disgusting party zone with loud music, cigarette buts, beer bottles, food and drunk people abusing the pool and the area! They have completely taken over the pool and rooftop 🤢🤬🤮.We were not able to use the pool at all!  We were going to complain when we saw a staff member chatting with them.. the room is very nice, but sadly won’t be rushing back!"
"Very nice hotel and very nice rooms, just too bad about other thing like going up to the roof top pool at 7:30 which closes at 8 pm for a nice evening swim only to find music blaring from 3 different ghetto blasters all at once. The hotel has music playing through there own system, the the other two brought up by other guest even so the hotel had there own speakers mounted on the roof.The staff were up there and said nothing to these people. Then returning to your room for a Quiet night only to find out the"

"The rooms do not have any refrigerators or microwaves and the part of town that it is located in is not the safest at night and there are not many restaurants withing walking distance. For a short overnight stay it is fine. With an extended stay, not being able to have any food in the room is a hassle."
"I suggest to the travellers visiting Ciudad del Carmen for business or any other reason to stay at the City Express in Play Norte, They have a good structure,location and a great staff to help you at any time."
We stayed two nights at the City Express hotel in Ciudad del Carmen in the Playa Norte area.  The hotel was clean and above average for Mexico.  Breakfast was included.  The pool was nice as our stay was in May during the hottest time of the year.  The hotel is also located across the street from the beach and next to a couple good restaurants.
This is similar to another review on a budget hotel I wrote in Valladolid.  Budget means you should expect less but asking for a bathroom that does not have part of the ceiling molded is not asking too much... The positive point of the breakfast was that it was free but I would prefer to pay a bit for something tasteful ..  In short if you compare with some budget hotels like Ibis - Holliday Inn Express .. in similar price ranges in Europe this chain has a lot to learn on balancing quality versus price. 
"The Hotel is located in an area where you have access to so much.  There are restaurants, attractions, the beach and public transportation to take you anywhere!  The hotel staff was always friendly and professional. Upon my arrival I was given an option to choose my room, I got one at top with an ocean view, it was awesome.  The room had a single bed and was ""small"" but perfect for business. Again this place is a great hotel to stay in and ideally located."
"We stayed for one night and we were so pleased with our choice that we stayed again with the chain but in Villahermosa. The place was really clean and quiet considering it was Saturday. Since the check in we were told about a free breakfast at 7am (from Monday to Friday is at 6:30am), we thought it would be just coffee and some bread but we also found fruit, chilaquiles and eggs, all of them really tasty. Bedroom tidy, comfortable, no luxury, just the basic for you to rest. There is no restaurant in the hot"

Excellent Service Keep it up..."
i had a nice stay in the hotel city express and i loved it cause it was close to the beach. In the front desk everybody was so nice they where with a nice smile and the breakfast was so good and a nice ubication.
"I love this hotel, it has a great location really close to the beach and restaurants!! Vey clean and the workers are very nice. I had  an event last month and they did everything posible for it to be perfect!!!"
"I have seen other reviews and I agree that the staff is not very welcoming, especially in the desk. However, the cleaning staff is very trusted, despite they used to get into the room even when I was asking for privacy, a point to improve. Everything else is just what is expected from an economic chain. Room was clean and big enough. The screen was ok IMO, water was fine and noise isolation is just average. AC was great. Breakfast is good for what is expected, again, from these hotels. Location is awesome, "
"We arrived at 2:45pm when check-in is supposed to be at 3pm. Usually hotels are accommodating, but the City Express employees behind the desk just kept going about their ""work"" and avoided eye contact after telling me check in was at 3pm. We stood with our confirmation information in front of the desk until one of the employees begrudgingly took the information and checked us in. Since she didn't hand us a room key we asked and she said they would give us the room at 3pm and went back to cutting out somethi"
heading offshore to work. I stayed here for 5 nights. Hotel was spotless clean. Staff in reception and restaurant where very helpful. English was understandable. Cleaner who cleaned my room they where great. Great job. With covid 19 and having to wear mask all staff in hotel always had this on. Hand sanitiser all over hotel. Experience was perfect. Thank you to all staff at holiday inn
"Food was brought in from another hotel so slightly cold sometimes, good supply of water and coffee for the rooms  Rooms are good size and clean  Friendly staff and surrounding areas were always clean  Would stay again "
"This is your typical hotel with a small swimming pool, friendly staff, and clean rooms located in the city (not near the beach) with several restaurants and stores nearby. It includes a small buffet with fruit, eggs, and bread."
"Just had to find a place for the night and this hotel was close to the highway. Good choice, they have parking, a swimming pool (which we didn't use) and nice patio rooms that go out to the pool, pretty quiet. The restaurant served surprisingly good food."
This is a very nice hotel with excellent service and the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel of any brand. I am a Hilton diamond member because I find the breakfast at Holiday Inn Express in the US to be boring The value here is excellent (I got the best deal booking directly with Holiday Inn) and the rooms are clean and spacious. There are a few bars across the street which are a little noisy but you cannot hear them in the room. Parking is plentiful and secure. The exercise room on the 5th floor is 
"Great staff. Breakfast is included, good mexican cooking plus granola, yogurt and fruit. A three choice juice, nice. You can have a sound breakfast. Although they don't serve lunch  or dinner, for free they arrange a shuttle to the other Holiday Inn to have a meal or drinks. Happy hour is for free is a nice treat for guests. The rooms are neat, comfortable. Efficient wi-fi, though sometimes in the bathroom the signal is lost. A small fridge in in the room so you can fill it with snacks and drinks. The pool "
"I found myself in Ciudad Carmen overnight and checked into Hotel Real.  Maybe they had just mopped but the place smelled like Fabuloso detergent and disinfectant.  Bar was closed, restaurant was empty but took an order for a cocktail.  I waited by pool area which had dirty tile and dirty table top.  Seemed like drink would never be served.  Waited what seemed like forever. I even went to restaurant and asked if they were making it. It finally showed up.  Intended to take a swim after long hot drive but pool"
"It is a comfortable hotel to stay in, rooms are spacious and staff are friendly. Breakfast is almost the same everyday but otherwise it is tasty. Location is near to supermarkets, Lapa Lapa and eateries. Next to the hotel is a sports complex which hotel guests can use for the running track and facilities. It is near the airport about 10-15 mins drive. Check out the bistro opposite the hotel which has carpet grass, you can still connect to the free hotel wifi so you can spend lunch or coffee there catching u"
" toward the airport.  El Vaquero I believe.  Other than the disinfectant smell, dirty pool area, poor drink service and pool full of loud chubby women the room was clean and otherwise comfortable. It was ok for one night transient stay.  Wouldn’t have wanted another night. "
This is a very nice new Holiday Inn Express.  Nicer and fancier looking than any Holiday Inn Express I have been to.  The breakfast is very superior to the regular Holiday Inn express hotels in the U.S.  Friendly service and great meeting rooms.  Our company had a training meeting at one of their conference rooms and we were impressed. 
…
"Staff friendly and helpful. Room clean, bed comfortable although the pillows are lumpy. Good WiFi. Breakfast offered and is sufficient for my taste. musli, yoghurt serial etc. no lunch, dinner or bar service which is why I say limited. Room service available although I did not try it. To cater for the lack of food and drink they offer a free shuttle back and forth between this location and other Holiday Inn hotel. That works well. Bar only opens at 7pm!,, anyway all in all its just fine for a business trip "
Stayed in this hotels for many times. Amazing place to relax after tough two months work on offshore.  Rooms are nice with comfy bed's and well cleaned. Good Wifi connection. Restaurant has good choice of food. Breakfast is excellent.  For pool users they have good and well maintained pool.
"The Hacienda Real is a good hotel with friendly staff. There's nothing better than a shower, cold beer and wifi after a six hour crewboat ride from the oil fields.   I can recommend this hotel for anyone travelling to Carmen.   Suggestion for improvement: English speaking TV channels!"
"The room had spartan furnishings, few outlets, a boring decor, a tiny bath, and smelled like wet towels. I choose the location to be close to immigration where I needed to complete paperwork. I have no idea why anyone would choose this hotel for a vacation destination since it is a distance to centro, and to the beach. Restaurants are a hike, and taxis have become very expensive in Playa.For the price, it is a huge disappointment."
I stayed in this Hotel for 1 night in Sep2015 and now again in Oct2015.It's a nice Hotel very near to Airport.Ambience of Restaurant is perfect and good tasty food.Rooms and Bathrooms are very neat and clean.Bed is perfectly arranged.Staff is very friendly and helpful.Just across the road is MEGA Superstore which was very handy to do some shopping before I leave for Mumbai.Overall a very good experience staying here.
"The hotel has the same looks of all Holiday In Express. The room has a good size, air conditioned works well and the shower is good. It is close to the downtown, since the city is small. The breakfas is ok. Very good for business trips"
"Stayed at this hotel several times in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Nice and clean rooms(but no refrigerator if you are not on the suite). Nice pool and friendly staff if you take into account that everything takes time in Mexico. The restaurant I can't recommend. "
Stayed here on our trip back to the US and will stay here again. Great food in their restaurant. Pool was nice for the day. This is an oil service town so keep that in mind. The rooms were like a Holiday inn. Lobby was very pretty with restaurant and pool visible.
"What did we like? The room was nothing special but fine. We swimming pool area is great to hang out around. The gym has a lot of equipment, although most of it could definitely use a refresh. Probably the nicest amenity was having access to a pair of free washers and dryers (you can buy detergent at the hypermarket two blocks away).   All this said, the property is a bit dated. As a IHG platinum member, in retrospect I wish I had booked the newer Holiday Inn Express nearby."
12 years since last trip.  This time was provided a room at the back end. Very poor state and dated.  Needs a good makeover.   Front end of the hotels looks great.  Bar and restaurant in decent state.  Has character.   Location convenient location for us on work assignments.  Huge supermarket across the main drag. 
"Probably the best hotel in town ! Quite charming with its hacienda-like style, surrounding a nice garden with a welcoming swimming-pool. Staff is friendly, but tends to be a bit slow (or sometimes ignore you) in the restaurant. Rooms are good but not great : good bed, very clean, lots of space but quite damp (if you don't leave the AC all day) and a great lack of decoration (oldish armchair, a single ikea-style picture on the walls) which makes the whole impression a bit ""cold"". The bathroom is also really "
"During my stay at this hotel, I really enjoyed the attention of the staff. All the staff was prone to help and assist. It's location is extraordinary, the surroundings are full of restaurants and places were to spend time are just few steps away. I surely come back to this place."
" with street view.  The restaurant gives me mixed impressions: not too bad and probably the only place in Carmen where you will find vegetables, but clearly overpriced for the city (imagine a standard cafeteria-level meal for the price of a local top restaurant) Last, the airport shuttle is quite convenient and the location is good, not too far from the center and the main malls."
Very nice hotel very comfort and stuff eas amazing i likr it much and hope visit it again soon . Good value for the money too . I recommenda everyone visit this hotel . They offers free breakfast too . 
"I would recommend this hotel, in general is very good, the price is fair for what you get. The staff is friendly with just one little problem when I did the check out, the girl in there told me that I should have checked out 1 hour before since it was 5 pm but I just arrived there that day, so I didn't even stay for one night, but just a few hours, even so she wanted me to pay for another night?? so for the next time I believe they should check when you arrived before even trying to suggest that you should "

"This hotel is good in general, the price is good for what you get, you even get free breakfast, and free wi fi, the connection was ok not the best but at least it worked. The room was clean and had a good size for what you pay, don't expect a big room. The only thing that needs a little bit more attention is to have nicer persons at the front desk but I don't have a complain just they weren´t so so friendly, but it is ok no complains, good hotel in general, the location is great since it is near some restau"
"This is a okay hotel with good prices. Nicea and friendly staff. But in the restaurant they don't speak English so it could be a litle hard to order food, the rooms are okay, bad showers and bathtubs. Nice sportsbar on the top floor. "
I stayed here 2 nights only during  our meetings in CdC. the hotel is quite clean and well maintained;  the bar on the 4th floor is really nice and if you are an IHG u have 2 free beer every night. breakfast are ok. Yes I can recommend it for a shot stay. 
"Love the staff specially the ladies at the front desk always willing to help and friendly. This is a nice hotel that got stuck in the 80’s as far as the rooms is concerned. They are clean, if just a little tired looking. Restaurant is decent specially during breakfast, the ladies at the griddle station know what they are doing. Shuttle to and from airport is free and convenient, it is also sometimes available for near drops but don’t count on it. All and all is adequate but not premium. However not a lot of"
Hotel is old but the basics are good. Love the breakfast which is very Mexican.  Gym is large with numerous cardio machine but only dumbbell  s and a  cable machine for weights. Air con is very strong which thankfully is crucial in Carmen.  Only 5 mins from hotel. 
I stayed 1 night during my trip to Carmen. Room was fine and food in restaurant was ok. This is a basic hotel for short stay and enough to get a good rest. Staff was very friendly and receptionist was very kind.
"Passed through CDC and stayed here. Was a little noisy but was a place to hang hat for one night. Out of Doble rooms but got an added bed for price of course. The breakfast was pretty good especially since it was included, hotel price was competitive. Fruit was very fresh!"
hotel is very clean and staff are great. waiter service can be a bit slow but if you're not in a rush no problem Rooms are very good and impeccably clean but the AC system can be very loud. All in all though very good value for the price.
"First they had buffet, that was good. The a la carte is not that good, eatable but no haute cuisine. Rooms are oke, only very noisy on the front near the road. For short stay, for longer stay requirements are too low."
"The service and warmth that the whole staff gives you, make you feel right at home. Just the amenities of which it would be nice for a gym or a pool for the customers. Other than that the location is incredible."
"The hotel experience was fine, only some noise from the hallway was getting in the room, and the food area in the restaurant could be more clean and tight. The staff is very friendly and is always willing to help with a smile."
"One night stay, rooms in very poor conditions: AC extremely noisy and not very really working, water pipes make very loud and very strange noises. The faucet its all clogged and water sits. You can easily tell that pillows and mattresses haven't been updated in years.... All the signs of a hotel which reinvest ZERO and has no intention of doing it. Very very sad and would never stay here again. Off course the  staff tries to its best, nice caring people who know what the customers are going through with the"
"the recepcionist had a very bad attitude, loke if he was amking me a favor or something, also it looked like he was making up requirements for my check in. other than that everything was pretty well.."
"I came back a second time in less then a month, this time I try to order from the small menu they have, I order Cesar salad and was very surprised it was very good.  They do not have a restaurant but you can order food to your room, they have wine small selection but no to bad.  Breakfast was very good and everyone was very helpful   I arrive on my motorcycle and they were very nice at looking after the bike on the parking lot"
"Rooms were OK. Basic - but A/C worked great, rooms were clean. Beds comfortable. The drawback is the service at the front desk. Hassle over room rates - one price online, then tried to raise the price giving the excuse that rates increased over the weekend. Mistakingly overstayed my week stay by a day, and was more than happy to pay for the extra day. Unfortunately, they had not record of me paying, and tried to get me to pay again. Don't get your laundry done there. Take a cab to a laundromat - even with t"
"I was on business trip and stayed in One hotel for 3 nights. The place is clean and tidy. Staff are friendly however not all could speak English. In general, a value for money accommodation especially for short business trips."
"Stayed for two nights. The hotel is very clean, staff is courteous but distant. The room and the bathroom were ok, big enough for the price. The hotel is very well located, with a supermarket just in the other side of the street. Shuttle service to the airport is offered free. Breakfast was ok, but not enough fruits."
"Stayed for 5 nights on a recent business trip. I found the staff pleasant in manner and helpful. The food was fine and the room larger than average and clean. The bar is very small, but has friendly staff and clientele. I liked the place. Perhaps the best recommendation I can give is that I shall be staying there again on my next trip to Cd del Carmen.."
"Horrible place to stay. Bedroom wasnt clean. We did book with booking.com and we we arrived at frontdesk they overcharged us for the breakfast wich was around 15$ per person. We accepted thinking that would be cool to have a buffet on the next morning! At 9am, the maid knocked at our door to ask if she could clean up the room!!! We were still sleeping...We went to the restaurant the next morning and the buffet was miserable... No much choice and nothing about breakfast.. Plus we had to argue with the waiter"
"I stayed at this hotel for one month during August when I first moved to Ciudad del Carmen fora  new job.   The rooms were clean, the customer service was great, availability of room service, laundry service available.   The staff always smiled and greeted me when I arrived.   I was not very happy when I had to leave.    The included breakfast is a buffet style breakfast, but nothing special."
"Great service, rooms and breakfast!!! We definitely recommend this place. We stayed in many places and this was the best during our travels! Staff was accommodating, bed was very comfortable and breakfast was excellent, many choices. Thanks for our stay!"
 That probably belongs to someone that slept here the night before us!!! I dont recommand this hotel to anyone. Plus its quite fat from the center! 
…
"This hotel is in a great location, across the street from a plaza real, 5 minutes from the airport and many restaurants in the area.  The staff is friendly and willing to help.  The rooms are comfortable and clean.  The breakfast has a great variety."
"First, the hotel staff are pleasant and attentive, but the hotel needs some repair. First I did reserve a room with a king, but that was not available and was given two doubles.   Second the shower was broken and the sink did not drain. there was a HDIM cable broken and hanging from the TV. I did not discover shower issue until I was already standing there nor did I discover the sink issue until I was shaving which was a bit of challenge.   I did report the issue with the shower and the guy and fixed it rig"
"Good place, quick reception and close to anything. There's a mall, a baseball stadium and some good places to have a drink, and just in walking distance. It took me couple of minutes to figure out how to make the lights work, because there is not instrructions or previous information. However it is very good for a quick business trip. It is what it is for the price, bed, toilet, shower and cable tv."
"Very peaceful place to unwind and stay. Clean room and the staff are service oriented...Food is Great!!! Facilities are beyond expectation...very near to anywhere like hospital, mall, supermarket , fast food and restaurant. It is highly recommendable place for your friends to stay and relax."
"The service is good, you know in advance that this is not a full service hotel.   I didn´t like the breakfast that is included, it has milk, coffee, scramble eggs, yogurt, some bread, fruit and other things.  You will have only basics in your room, the room is small, have a little ""desk"" and a small closet.   Is not allowed to smoke, but operational people don't respect this detail all the time, you can smell the smoke in your restroom (because I think they smoke in the restroom because the fire detector is"
"Excellent service, amenities, and staff. Food of good standard and bed very comfortable. Check in and Check out very easy. Efficient staff in all areas of hotel. Good internet connection and good transport service to and from airport."
"The room was ok, nothing special, good attention, clean! There's no gym nor pool, which could give a better stay. Internet was ok. The breakfast, average, not bad but could be much better quality. The hotel could have potential to be better."
This hotel is good for overnight stay. Though the rooms are clean and furniture store are near new but I found it odd there was no mini-bar in the room and not even a bottle of water in the room.....this won't be too much to offer to your guest as a freebie.
"If you don't need to be in ciudad del Carmen? Don't travel there. Just drive around it. You can get much better rooms and service for 900 pesos.   Along our trip we visited almost ten hotels of various prices. Our stay at One on Friday the 9th was definitely the least pleasurable.  Rooms are simple, clean but not decorated or comfortable.   Receptionist Ixhel took my drivers license for check-in but then forgot to return it. Thanks for the police checkpoint just outside town where we noticed.   Other staff "
"Si los agarra la noche, surge un imprevisto, es adecuado para descansar y continuar al dia siguiente, tiene algunos detalles, pero en general esta bien con su frigobar, clima, cama confortable, tiene estacionamiento aunque algo limitado. Va bien si vas de paso."
"We stayed here because we were on our way to Mérida, Yucatán by car and it looked ok on the web. The hotel is in an ok location with parking, the room was nice and clean. The only thing we didn't like was that there were no elevators and the hotel has several floors. We had to carry all of our stuff like the stroller, the baby's crib, our luggage, plus other things up to our room."
Muy desagradable la recepción del hotel sucia y con olor a humedad. La habitación limpia pero con olor a humedad y un aire acondicionado que enfría poco. Necesitan más limpieza en todo el hotel para que los huéspedes nos sintamos a gusto y seguros. No volveré a este “hotel”
As you would expect from a middle of the line Hotel chain in Mexico. the staff was courteous and did their best. rooms were clean and food was good when available. there is a shopping center very close by with good local and commercial food.  I would recommend if you need to stay close to the airport.
Everything was very nice. The rooms were nice and also clean. The staff was helpful and professional.We have stayed there many times and will stay there next time we visit Cuidad de Carmen. The breakfast had a good variety and was set up for cleanliness and safety from the spread of germs.
"The staff is extremely accommodating and do whatever they can to make your stay comfortable. Gabby , Wendy & Javier went above their duties to assist in any way they could. The only down side to my stay is that the menu is very limited but they still try to accommodate you off the menu "
"We didn't plan to stay here, but other plans fell through and we were able to book at the last minute....I booked online in the car as we were driving to the hotel.  I walked in and they already had my reservation and check in was super easy.  Then the room....the beds and pillows were AMAZING.  We had been traveling around the Yucatan and had some hard beds previously-these were so nice, I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning.  We didn't use the pool, but looked at it and it was fine and outdoors. "
 on the 5th floor and had a nice view of the city.

The staff was helpful friendly and very courteous. The breakfast was excellent.  Room was really clean and comfortable. Good location easy to access. Would recommend this place for value  comfort and good place to relax.
"A great price for a Hyatt Place (which doesn't vary much from property to property). I stayed for a few nights.  I was able to park out front (or on the side) each night.  There are a lot of traveling business employees that are staying here. Many work crews as well.  At first Google Maps took me into the parking of the mall that is on the wrong side of a wall but it wasn't a big deal to come back out to the main road, go up a couple of blocks and make a u-turn before pulling into the hotel.  I was surprise"
" came in and sort of cleaned the room - didn't change out the towels.  Made the bed.  I felt bad about the underwear and clothes sitting on the floor - oops. They were left as is. LOL.  I went outside to use the pool - didn't find any towels.  I was probably supposed to use those in the room.  Everything was clean.  One morning there were no utensils for breakfast. I wouldn't rate this property above average, but it was more than acceptable.    The mall does have some dining options (Bostons Pizza/sports ba"

"The hotel is very comfortable and beautiful, has nearby places to eat, and the reception staff is very friendly and helpful. It is an excellent place to rest and they provide you with kitchen utensils if you need them to cook."
"We were pleased to find somewhere easy to get to, where they spoke English ( we try but our Spanish is very very limited unfortunately !) The car park is watched over day and night. A luggage trolley was available and easy access to the upper rooms with a large lift. A shame that they had « air fresheners » squirting out of the ceiling in the corridors - the smell was too strong and made it difficult to breath. Complimentary breakfast was not really breakfast consisting only of a fruit and a piece of bread "
"Pretty good ExtendedStay Hotel in Carmen. Service was great. Pool area is and Gym really cool. Rooms equipped with kitchens, spacious and confortable. Stayed there 12 days. there is a Chedraui just across"
This hotel was very clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. We only stayed one night but we had  a group so had three rooms and all were nice. We will be making this trip again next year and plan on staying here again.  The breakfast was great too!
"Don't stay here. I normally don't write reviews, but this was so so much, that I decided to write it.  We had to stay at this place, because it wasn't any other room available in town. We wasn't expecting something fancy or spacious, but something clean at least...... The first thing I noticed as soon we entered in to the room was long black thick hairs on the floor, uugggg!!!, I mean... Did they clean the room? Then, the bathroom... Full of pubic hair on the floor...... I almost died...... Then the next qu"
"My second time in this hotel, and every time facing a troubles with service, restaurant, quality of food.  Got sick twice of food. Personal not communicating in English and not paying attention to clients. Only one towel provided. AC in the room were good."
"Well....I’ll start by saying that I’m a dyed in the wool Hilton man!  I’ve spent decades wandering the globe causing chaos and creating havoc.  Hilton has that canny knack of delivering wonderfully almost every time.  There’s something unique about the way they treat you and run their hotels.  I love them all.....  On arrival at the Hampton Inn in Ciudad del Carmen I was underwhelmed.  Carmen is a dusty one horse town dedicated, in the most part, to the oil industry.  Well I wasn’t expecting anything specia"
" My room was basic and zero views.  However.....the food was more than edible, the service impeccable from the Bell Hop to the waitresses and the receptionists.  This is, I think,  a 3 star affair but with a full on 5 star service....!!!!  It behoves me to mention that I arrived at the height of Covid 19 but nothing was too much for this splendid team.  Francia the young lady at reception was outstandingly lovely and made my visit a Royal treat.  The lads in the bar and restaurant and canteen were all wonde"

Ice machine shut off Fridge does not work Shower is a death trap Bathroom fan does not work and has not been cleaned in months if ever.  Tv picture quality was lacking  Misquotes in the room  Other than that it was ok
Was only at hotel 2 nights. Staff helpful. Good value for money.  Location near our office. Security present. Well maintained. Gym was a bit small. Over all a good place to stay and spend a couple of nights. 
"The hotel is designed  for business related visitors. Very clean and confortable hotel. Very open to please you with your needs. the cheff agree to plese me with a dish out of the menu,, Excellent quality."
"This hotel is a great choice for a business trip. It is close to many customers, has some restaurants nearby, but need transportation for most of them. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Good quality breakfast and a reliable internet connection. Steps away from my company office."
"This was my first Hampton inn hotel stay , 5 nights. No hot water during entire stay , pool was dirty , lobby men’s toilets disgusting, hotel room desk had a protruding screw which almost contacted my thigh was sat at the desk , luckily I noticed and removed it by hand, staff were ok and helpful , overall the hotel didn’t shine a good light on a Hilton hotel."
The place is great. Good team keeps the place comfortable and taken care of. Good breakfast. More or less coffee. The orange juice machine wasn’t that good. Room for improvement but going in the right direction. 
"We booked this place while literally fleeing in a taxi from a supposedly 4.5 star resort in Playacar that was so awful we left four days before our check out date.  So, it was luck (not skill) that landed us at Alea Tulum.  This place is modern yet beachy, small yet dairy/open, and offers great service and lovely food/drinks.  We booked in a way that included breakfast (which offers a great selection and generous portions) and the mini bar (which I highly recommend because the tap water in the Yucatan is br"
" week your of Mexico.  The rooms are clean and comfortable, with great amenities and everything you could want.  The upper rooms have balconies with unobstructed views of the sea.  The lower rooms have direct access to the pool, which is cool, clean, and lovely.  The beach has its share of seaweed, and the sandy part is not wide like you'd find further north in Quintana Roo.  But if you aren't planning to do much swimming in the sea, it's not a big problem.  There's also a dock where you can sit and even re"

"My husband and I found this place and had only booked one night. We ended up staying for 4 nights. It is everything we wanted. The rooms are first class - even good coffee makers (Nespresso)! Great showers, comfy beds and a balcony to watch the sun rise over the Caribbean. There is a constant fresh ocean breeze, and a wonderful  natural granite poo. The food is excellent and can be served inside or out as well as in your room. Finally, the staff are all exceptional. It has very laid back, non-pretentious fe"
 especially to Miguel and Eric!

"Our second time at Alea! We absolutely love it here. All the wait staff and service was excellent. Rafael was our waiter everyday and he was fantastic. Beautiful relaxing hotel. Beautiful views, great snorkeling, wonderful beach. If you want to relax in paradise without the busy this is the place to come! Hotel has everything you need, snorkeling gear, kayaks, paddle boards, bicycles, and plenty of lounging areas. Thank you to everyone here!"
If you like to take a swim and not only look at the ocean... choose another location. Very shallow waters and a lot of rocks. Impossible to swim from the beach.   Very dissapointed in gluten free options and no understanding for guests with allergens. When ordering coffee with soya milk we could not trust if they got it right or mixed with regular milk. 'No gluten free' was the words from waiter. Though hotel is promoting them selves for having good options for this.   Would never come back. Remote location
Pros:  The rooms are big and well laid out. You could easily spend a while here. The location is fantastic. On the beach and a 10min drive into town or to multiple cenotes. Breakfast is decent. Nice jetty and views.  Cons: The road to the hotel is a nightmare. Pot holes a foot deep. A journey which should take 1 min takes about 5 mins as you have to navigate a series of massive pot holes which will potentially damage your car. The mini bar was set to 17 degrees. What's the point? We were told that's the tem
Really enjoyed our 3 night stay at Layla. The hotel is small and intimate with a Moroccan inspired design in the middle of town close to many good bars and restaurants. There is a great rooftop pool and bar. The staff could not have been more helpful with suggesting and booking restaurants and activities.
" spoke to someone helpful other times we were ignored or fobbed off.  I'm 50:50 for recommending as the setting and rooms are lovely. However, I wouldn't stay here again and use the same money to try somewhere else. It isn't cheap after all and given the cons listed above, I'm include to try somewhere else next time."
"Just came back from a really enjoyable 5 night stay at Layla. Firstly it is really well located if you’re staying in Tulum town. We had a rental car so parked right outside and drove to the sights and cenotes during the day (and the beach area). The pool is an amazing spot for a swim, food or cocktails. We ate breakfast up there each day ( included in our rate. ) I tried a couple of options from the menu and both were delicious. I saw others having it in their rooms or the ground floor restaurant area. I of"
" our room (not all have this) but it looked amazing and i loved our bathroom. I think the rooms might feel small to guests who are used to larger hotel rooms but it didn’t bother us. My only slight negative comment is that you might hear music in the bedroom at some points, but it’s because noise echos through the hotel. (I called reception to turn it down one night which was done immediately but only because I had a very early start the next day) Overall, I really really enjoyed our stay, and would highly "

"We loved Layla and found the vibes perfect for our recent birthday visit.  Others have mentioned Daniel at the front desk and he's a gem.  He's warm and gracious -- and provides a level of care that is more typically of a five-star property.   But the entire staff is kind and efficient.  The roof pool is perfect and the rooms have unique features.  For the price, I don't think you'll do any better.    There are lots of vlog posts about staying at the beach vs. town.  We really liked the vibes in town and ge"
 AF.   Thanks again to Daniel and everyone at Layla for making my recent Bday stay so special.

"We loved our stay in Layla Tulum. Everything was perfect: the room was beautiful, breakfast was delicious and the location is superb. Just a few minutes walk and you are on the main road of Tulum centre. From there, it's very easy to take a collectivo (mini bus) to cenotes between Tulum and Playa, to Akumal beach or even straight to Playa itself. Restaurants are also close. You have to try the burgers on Layla's top floor restaurant - they are delicious!! Also bike rental places (like OlaBike) are close by "
 welcoming and kind.  I would definitely recommend this hidden gem!

"Room was spacious and clean. The whole area offers rooms, space for RV and camping and a small beach. There is also a restaurant and workshops, so, all in all it looks more of an aggregation of activities. Only ""problems"" is that the wifi is not available in the rooms and the prices are high compared to other B&B in Yucatan. Also, breakfast was not included in the price. Most likely the reason is because it is the only structure that offers B&B service for tourists... still disappointed by the price/offered"
"We stopped here on our way to Campeche as we were running out of gas!  We found La Gringa...both the hotel and the owner.  She is a Mexican lady who married an American marine...who has since passed away.  She was very pleasant and spoke excellent English and was very helpful.  She gave us a nice room.  The only problem was the bugs...of course not something she had control over, but the mosquitoes for some reason kept finding their way into the room by droves!  The room and bathroom were nice, clean, and w"
"The room was large but full of light and very noisy (people working early in the morning, the dogs barking...). The wifi didn't work, just in front of the reception. The bathroom was divided not by a door but by a plastic curtain. There were 2 big black bugs. Breakfast was not included. All this stuff for 70 dollars of season!!!! "
"Incredible place. Known by both Freedom Shores and La Gringa Hotel and RV Park / Campground. It was bought and totally renovated by the current owners. Tragically Mr. Bussear passed away recently but his wife Doña Telma is carrying on and it is a really nice place to spend a few days of relaxation.  The hotel and a couple of RV sites are fully wheel chair accessible. Mr. Bussear spent most of his life in a wheel chair and it was his dream to build a place like this. Hotel rooms are spacious, clean and have "
" leads out to a public beach with nice shallow, protected sea. The town is known as Isla Aguada and isn't much to talk about. Lots and lots of fisherman and a couple of other seafood restaurants. I only spent a day here so can't say much more. If you are traveling the Gulf shore in Campeche / Tabasco this is a great place to spend a few days. Hotel rooms for 2 were 900 pesos and camping was 300 pesos. Approx. $73US and $24US."
"Over all our experience was better than expected. The rooms, grounds, beach and service was awesome. And, then came the incensent constant music. Blasting from 8am to 8pm, I didn't as an adult come to hear Disco music, boom, boom, booming in my ear all day. When i requested if they could lower it, i was told an emphatic NO! Not only on the beach but they have speakers everywhere on the property - even on the lounge swing chairs.  HEY GUYS  I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU 5 STARS BUT THE MUSIC REALLY RUINED OUR VACAT"
"The Roc Luxe hotel wass super nice a great experience five nights here in Tulum before heading over to Holbox for a different but just as cool experience. The food here was great and even probably some of the best food we’ve had at hotels to be honest. The staff was super helpful and sweet, returning soon."
The best part of our 5 day stay was starting our day @6am with Matt. His energy was contagious and his presence inviting. He was creative with his workouts and adjusted as needed. It never felt like a workout it was soo much fun!!   Highly recommend classes with Matt Wise.
"We made a last minute decision to stay at Roc Lux Tulum. We felt very welcomed by the staff from point of arrival. The hotel has one of the best beach front locations with the only one as far as I could see with a pool on the beach front directly looking into the sea. Julio was a stand out member of the Roc Lux Hotel, he has connections with all the major restaurants. With great industry knowledge on which restaurant is best on certain nights. Making us reservations without any issues. Nothing was a problem"
"My husband and I booked to stay at Nömade after some hesitation having clocked a few recent critical trip advisor reviews. Very happy to report that we didn’t recognise the criticisms made in those reviews: perhaps these were teething problems getting back up to speed after pandemic disruption.   We stayed in a Tierra Suite and loved it: Room 201 had a shady plunge pool, perfect for cooling down (Tulum is hot in May!) It felt very private, although just off a path to the beach there was loads of foliage so "
Staying at Roc Luxe Tulum was one of the best decisions for our trip. It was effortless to communicate with the staff through WhatsApp chat and they made amazing recommendations for food and outings. They helped us to find activities that were even better than the ones we had planned in the first place.  We walked along the beach and thought Roc Luxe Tulum was easily the best spot out of all the hotels. The floating beds on the beach were amazing and it was the PERFECT location. It was within walking distan
What a great hotel. Loved the setting. Loved the atmosphere. Super service. We ate nearly every evening at the restaurant because of the food was outstanding. I would not hesitate to recommend it and definably would come back here in a heart beat.
"Villa de Rosa is a wonderful choice for a tranquil vacation. If what you are looking for is a quiet, relaxing beach, in the middle of Akumal barrier reef and nature preserve, then this is your place!   Tony was amazing, responsive, and provided us with great service with any request.   Our room was a spacious 2 BR facing the beach and adjacent to the local bar and restaurant Beach Bikini. The beds where great, and it has a fully equipped kitchen.   The place is very well maintained and yet, feels dated and "
" and don’t appear to have been charged for this. Wifi was quick.  Breakfast at Macondo starts at 7:30 and room service had a slightly odd black spot between about 7 and 7:30am when it closed, which could be slightly inconvenient if you want to eat before 8am yoga. However we usually waited until after our morning activities to have a leisurely breakfast. One day we need need to finish breakfast by 8 to go on an excursion and service at the restaurant was quick enough to turn us around in half an hour.   On "

We stayed a couple nights at Piedra Escondida and we were really impressed. The hotel was perfectly located on a quiet beach. Martin was amazing -- he was so helpful and kind. The food was good and the rooms were clean and nice. The highlight of the stay was having turtles hatch in front of the restaurant during dinner. Might have been the best moment of the 2 week trip for our kids.
Our family of four had a wonderful stay in the ocean front two bedroom! It was a beautiful view off the balcony and a nice place to unwind in after tours. Tony was always attentive to our requests and very professional and thoughtful.

"Great value & service. From the moment we arrived, Tony took great care of us.  Room was a great price, room service food was delivered quickly and was hot and delicious.  The beach area was very peaceful.  It’s holiday week and we were very lucky to get any room.  We have a garden/pool view but are hoping to check out the very spacious ocean view suites.

"During our 4 day stay at B Tulum, which has shared classes with Nomade, my sister and I joined Matt's yoga classes, which were one of the best we've ever had. He was extremely attentive, his voice was soothing, his instructions were clear, and he was always there to correct our postures. We loved him so much that we decided to ask him for 6:00 am Personal Training.  If you ever get a chance, please try out his yoga and workout classes. HE IS THE BEST!"

"We celebrated our anniversary this year and chose Bardo for a week getaway. It's absolutely beautiful!  A couple of things we didn't like. For the amount of money we spent nothing really came with the room price, except for the water. We would have liked to use the robes without charge and it would have been nice if they provided slippers, after all the theme is all about relaxation. There was also a day we asked for our pool to be cleaned out but it took 2 hours to get someone to come. However the plunge p"
"We just returned from a four night stay in Tulum.  I am so glad we decided to stay here. I was deciding between here and a few other places and basically this place had the best price to review ratio and had local food at their restaurant.  Overall, it was beautifully situated, great energy, and had a very authentic vibe with a European touch.   The room was basic, but functional.  We were on the lower floor and had a nice outdoor patio that served as our ""living room"" right on the beach. Then off that was "
"Our group stayed at Villas DeRosa for one week. Awesome trip. Hotel pickup , good food, very clean and friendly. Owner was very accommodating making sure we had tanks for diving each day or anything else we might need. Beach is beautiful and clean. This was my 21st trip there and I wouldn’t stay anywhere else!"
"We went to Nomade for our 6th year anniversary. We booked a deluxe tent. When we went to the tent, there was a very bad smell in the garden of the tent and also inside the tent, probably because the tent was located right next to the public toilet of the hotel. Right next to our tent, there was maintenance construction work going on!!! And the hotel didn’t really care about it and gave us that tent but the concierge said, they would cancel the planned construction the next day because we complained about it"
"The Mereva hotel was a super nice experience to get away from the all-inclusive resorts that my family and I tend to dislike. This time of year the seaweed was pretty bad, so we couldn’t really swim much in front of the resort. The pool and nearby cenote made up for this thankfully. The food here was very good, probably some of the best hotel food i’ve ever had. The complementary breakfasts were also a delight. While staying here, however, I think my mobile charging bank was stolen when it was charging on t"
"Hmmmm yes very disappointing. We ended up at this beach club a bit by accident but it seemed nice and the guy negotiated on the minimum spend for a bed for the day.  Through the day the food and drink was good but they fundamentally let themselves down when it came to the bill. They have no wine menu (or failed to produce one). We were offered two wines, chose the cheaper one but when the bill came the price for the wine was higher. $35 more. Conveniently enough to get us over the first minimum spend price "
" all that great and we did not get the full 70 mins. Lastly we did have a minor charge issue, when we landed back home we received a message that we would be charged additionally for a vape pen housekeeping reported missing that we did not use! After speaking to management they did not follow through with the charge which was greatly appreciated, however they need a better system for those items in the room!  Overall it was a great stay. Food and drinks were excellent, hotel was close to shops, restaurants "
 bathroom where used toilet paper needs to be deposited as the septic system in Tulum cannot handle the paper). So it's pretty gross and something you dont want to open unless you have to.  I would also recommend installing some hooks on the walls in the bathroom to hang towels and clothes otherwise there is no place to put clothes in the very small bathroom.     Also having a water filling station would be nice.  Small individual bottles are so bad for the environment and not sustainable.  Kills me every t

Not only the perfect location on quiet AvAkumal Beach, but staff  is friendly & helpful, take care of all our needs, food excellent.  The rooms are clean & welcoming...whether poolside hotel room or beachside condo.  Dive Shop located on property makes diving in nearby freshwater cenotes convenient as well.

 compensation which caused a third person to come over and the debate started again with further insinuation we weren’t telling the truth. Eventually they cut down the price of the wine claiming the tip/service charge was mandatory. They appeared to be more concerned with their own pocket than the business or repeat custom.  Google reviews had suggested we weren’t the first to experience this by far. I wish we’d followed the advice.

"Our poolside room smelled awful and the bed was damp. We were told the room would be cleaned every other day. Our room was never cleaned during our 3 day stay. We had to hound the host for every little thing (new water jug, beach towels etc)."
"I wanted to like Nueva Vida so much. The price, location on the beach, charming breakfast restaurant, and parking included were all pluses for this hotel. BUT we stayed in the Ave de Paraiso Garden Studio which drastically reduced the overall quality of the trip due to noise.  This room abuts the main road along Tulum Beach and, unfortunately, is located approximately 50 meters away from two restaurants: Ilios (see pictures) and Bak. These half-nightclub, half-restaurants blare music and bass from 7:00 or 8"

"This is the perfect spot for anyone looking to avoid the busy and noisy all-inclusive hotel experience. It is a small but beautiful place. One of the best things is their  chef (Javier) who prepares delicious, fresh food with an artistic presentation. Everything we ate there during our stay was of excellent quality and beautifully presented. It makes you forget you are in a small hotel!  Another highlight is the superb service.  All the staff are ready and very willing to make sure the visitors are enjoying"
…
"I cannot more strongly recommend staying at this hotel. Please, please do yourself a favor and stay here.  The rooms and overall common grounds are stunning -- they truly encompassed the tulum organic aesthetic.The restaurant is spectacular, the service at the front desk, restaurant, and pool are all around wonderful, the rooms are clean and chic (individual ""bungalows""), and they even offer morning yoga! I saw many people easily take taxis to the town for the day/their dinner reservations. We opted to use "
"Can not even explain how much my friends and I LOVED this place!!!!!! Nayeli first off was amazing, gave us a tour of the property, set us up with welcome drinks and checked on us throughout our stay regarding covid testing to get back into the US. She was friendly and helpful our entire stay!!! The restaurant… OMG everything we ate was UNREAL. Words can’t even describe how good the food was and one breakfast entree is included in your stay EACH DAY!!!  Each morning we went all the waiters were so helpful a"
I am so happy I trusted the reviews and chose this hotel! If you want to stay away from the crowds in Tulum in a secluded and affordable hotel do not hesitate to book here. The service was amazing they let us check in early and delivered breakfast to our room every morning. The room was spacious and cozy. We selected a one bedroom with a kitchen and living room. Our room was ocean front on the first floor so our back door led directly to the beach. The beach is a bit rocky with some seaweed at the shoreline
" clearer disclaimer noting late-night noise would have been appreciated. Beyond the noise, the room was okay and good for the price you pay which is notably lower than many other Tulum beachfront options. This makes its other rooms especially attractive options.   The beach was well kept, parking was included, and the housekeeping was prompt each day. The service was similarly good-not-great. A unique pro of this hotel is the inclusion of breakfast at the restaurant called Tamarindo across the street. This "
"Nomade transcends you into a mystical jungle vibe - you instantly feel far away from your daily grind which is exactly why we chose it.  This was our 2nd time there and the  place never disappoints.  The food, staff and overall ambient is exquisite.  We stayed in the master suite which was something out of a movie.  Both restaurants were amazing and quite frankly one can easily stay there and never leave and not miss a thing.  Perfect place to unplug and recharge."
"We stayed in the area and ate at this restaurant 3 times.  The food is flavorful, authentic and homemade.  The drinks are handcrafted and one of a kind.  The staff are friendly and were very accommodating to our larger group. We enjoyed the tacos so much we made it our last stop before the airport, so we could savor the flavors of the Yucatan."
"This hotel is simply beautiful, with a relaxing and peaceful aesthetic. The whole staff was so warm and welcoming.   In particular, the Milum restaurant was exceptional. The food was incredible - we came back several days in a row for the grilled vegetarian burrito and guacamole. It was one of our favorite experiences in Tulum. Thank you to server Leo and the whole Milum team for being so kind and attentive!  Highly recommend Hotel Bardo and Milum."
" beautiful. The property was perfect, the best location with multiple bars and restaurants near by, but quieter than the main strip about 5 minute drive down the road. The private beach was amazing, someone each morning was cleaning up the seaweed which was a plus. They had lounge chairs, palapas, bean bags, swings, everything. I already can’t wait to come back and stay at piedra escondida!!!!! Stay here!!!"
 cutest heart warming puppies came out to play on the beach everyday.

"The Nômade is an ideal hotel for a relaxing stay at the beach. Everywhere the service is top. Extremely friendly and very attentive. From the restaurants, to the beach stuff and especially the concierges do all they can to make your stay as perfect as it can be. (Eugenia and Samuel were just amazing)  The food in both restaurants is delicious and the setting is just perfect. With its eco-friendly and sustainable touch it shows perfectly how modern travelling and hospitality should be.  Don't miss the yoga c"
We paid $365 per night for one of the beachfront rooms that are on the second floor (I think they’re better than the first floor ones because you have your own private balcony and more privacy).  The hotel is small and cute but much too expensive for where it’s located (far from more popular areas of TULUM) The ride over feels a bit sketchy and the area around the hotel is empty and feels desolate. Because of the Seaweed issue in Tulum the beach was basically unusable!! They have men throughout the day work
I stayed at the Bardo for five nights. We were greeted by the nicest staff at reception and the exceptional service continued through our stay.  The room was more than spacious and lots of places to lounge like the huge sofa and an outside private pool. There is no television so it’s great to switch off (but bring a tablet if you must - the WiFi is perfect with high speed connectivity).   The hotel has a great restaurant and the waiters around the pool are very attentive but not too overbearing to make you

"Proceed with caution when booking. There are two club restaurants across the street that blare music into the early hours of the morning which make it impossible to fall asleep. Even as New Yorkers used to loud night noises, this was next level: people breaking plates and yelling, techno music that shakes the very walls. It’s very hard to enjoy the beautiful beach, solid breakfast, and well-situated hotel when you’ve been up all night listening to blaring music.   Pretty disappointing and just wanted to get"
" are too strong to enjoy it. Luckily they have a small lake just a few feet away from the hotel that you can go to (for $3) and snorkel / swim or Scooba dive. I suggest going later in the day when it’s not so busy.  The food at the restaurant is nice but nothing to write home about, cocktails are definitely lacking in alcohol and you should request a double shot when ordering any drink. Front desk staff were incredibly sweet and helpful but restaurant staff was a bit pushy for tips and very slow with servic"
"So there’s some good things and bad as with all trips away but I feel the hotel over sold and under delivered.   Good points - large rooms, jacuzzi bath on balcony, free parking, 24/7 security, restaurant opening hours are longer than usual so no restrictions. Free bicycles to take out for the day. Snack bar open from 12 onwards. Not over crowded as it’s a small hotel.  Bad points - rooms are not like those pictured in the ads, the hotel needs a renovation as it’s tatty around the edges and not luxury. The "
 I would throughly recommend - so relaxing and a perfect way to make a trip.
We love this spot!! Food is absolutely delicious and service spot on! We didn’t stay at the accommodation but ate at the restaurant 4 or 5 times during our stay. Beach is lovely and quite a great place to completely unwind. Best guac I’ve ever had!!!
"Wow!!! We passed by this place on our way to check out a condo down the beach found on booking.com. We stopped because of the dive center sign and went into check it out. We took a room for 2 nights. After the first night of having a drink at the beach bar followed by watching baby turtles go to the sea and mama turtles lay their eggs we were hooked! We went ahead and changed our reservation for the rest of our trip! The room was clean, we loved the laid back vibe of having a drink on the beach before going"
"I would absolutely return on a future trip. The rooms are separated by a labyrinth of sand paths through the trees--almost gives it a summer camp vibe. Also little beach cats running around!! We slept every night with the doors wide open and the mosquito net to hear the ocean. You can see the ocean right from your room and balcony and hammock with great views of the sunrise.   There's two really loud restaurants across the street, but we were close enough to the ocean to not really hear them. The hotel is i"

" wifi bolt on with our provider.  The aircon in our room was broken the whole time we were there meaning we struggled to sleep as the room got up to 26 degrees, we went to reception on a number of occasions to ask for this to be looked into however each time someone came they proclaimed it was working despite the fact our room never dropped below 24 degrees.  The coffee/tea making facilities consisted of a filter coffee machine and one creamer sachet which was not replaced everyday so we went to the local 7"
"We had a phenomenal experience at Hotelito Azul- from the moment we walked in we were greeted with the utmost welcoming staff, that made you feel special and appreciated. The attention to detail and staff were amazing. They went above and beyond to assure we were well taken care of. A special thank you to Pedro the hotel manager. Overall an excellent experience and would definitely return and would recommend to anyone looking for a lush experience in Tulum- I highly recommend this his property!!! Enjoy!!"
…
" beach. Thankfully, it's not directly next to any of the clubs that blast loud music. Perfect tranquil beach days. Tamarindos will bring food/drinks to you for a fee or you can walk to the surrounding beach clubs.   My ONLY complaints are that the water jug is tiny and I would run out of water every day and that I would have loved to drink coffee on the balcony."
"I visited here with my mother and sister and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing service and cool atmosphere. We loved the music, food and overall vibe. Shoutout to our servers, Miguel, Jose Luis, and Francisco. Thank you for making our visit great!"
"Casa Malca is an incredibly unique stay in Tulum. We have been to Tulum several times. We've stayed at hotels on the beach, hotels in town, AirBnBs, etc. But Casa Malca was by far our favorite stay. The entire staff was incredibly welcoming, helpful and attentive. The property was beautiful. The townhouse we stayed in was amazing. It was incredibly spacious, modern and private. Extra bonus was a private rooftop deck to watch the sunset. The food was incredible across the restaurants and the beach / pool ser"
…
I am SO excited my Dad and I stumbled upon this spot on our beach walk one morning. We stopped by for some drinks and ended up staying all day on the beautiful rooftop! Eleazar and his staff are amazing and so accommodating. I will definitely be going back as many times as I can to catch some beautiful sunsets and show this place off to visiting friends ❤️
"Best hotel I have stayed in! Embedded in a jungle setting with bohemian decor, plunge pool on the entrance to each room as a basic level with top class rooms. A lot of effort and attention to detail goes into the hotel, with each evening outdoor camp fire lit with complementing outdoor candles, makes for excellent setting for a late night time swim in there 24 hour slightly heated swimming pool. Breakfast brought to our private pool side was a highlight before the morning 9pm yoga class. (Breakfast was also"

"This was my first experience with an all inclusive resort and now that I've been so spoiled by the Kore I don't know how I'm ever going to stay in a regular hotel again.  The best thing by far was the staff.  They were so sweet and polite and helpful.  Anything we asked for they brought and with a smile on their face, like hot sauce for the table, drink after drink after drink, dish after dish of food.  They even let us practice our Spanish with them.  Great people for sure.  My room was clean, pillows and "
"The location, the decor, and the staff were amazing! They made our stay in Tulum wonderful! They had bicycles and scooters you could rent to explore Tulum. The concierge service was very knowledgeable of the local area and was able to get us reservations to some fantastic restaurants/night life venues!  The rooftop bar has the best view you can get in Tulum! Thank you guys for an amazing time in Tulum! We will be back ☺️☺️"
" Jose he kept our reservation and extended our stay! Melissa gave us excellent suggestions and organised car rental at short notice delivered to the door. I have read some of the bad reviews on hotel Bardo, they are ridiculous! Stayed in 100’s of hotels and this by far the most outstanding hotel."
"We used to love this resort thanks to its beautiful views, serene ocean and romantic feel. This was our fifth visit over the last 10 years - sadly the last one... The neighborhood has changed so much... there are two noisy clubs nearby and the property hasn't invested money into maintenance. Rooms are the same as they were 10 years ago and the beach is not maintained any more. Most guests seem to be party-goers who use the resort to sleep, not for the beach. The property managers Ricardo are great (thank yo"
My significant other and I cannot say enough about this fabulous spot. Not only was the location ideal the service was impeccable. If you’re looking for A small boutique hotel that provides five star service in a most tranquil atmosphere this is the place for you. We have to give a big shout out to Francisco. He went above and beyond  to help facilitate our wonderful experience at Mereva.
"Very noisy hotel. Not relaxing at all. Seems that there’s no place to find any tranquility. Music is coming from all directions, people are screaming, cars honking. It’s too close to the road and not well secluded. Not a great experience."

"We arrived on Thursday, there was a notice under our hotel door the power would be out but would return 1 PM on Friday. 1 PM Friday came and went and there was no air-conditioning no power no Wi-Fi no nothing. I went down to the front desk and asked what was going on nobody had any answers. Sunday morning the air conditioner finally went back on and we were leaving on Monday."
Great hotel… great food… awesome roof top bar… fabulous staff.  Location is good nas close to everything via cab or just a pleasant walk.  The music is amazing … I Shazam’d so many songs and created an off the charts playlist that will forever remind me of the great time in Tulum and Hotelito Azul.
"Nueva Vida is a beautiful place to stay, with comfortable beds, cosy bungalows and a lovely beachfront, and many restaurants right outside the property. The included breakfast at the restaurant across the street was wonderful, organic farm fresh food, and all the staff here are super friendly. The little sand trails to the rooms give it a very warm atmosphere.  There’s pretty loud music at the restaurant across the street in the evenings, which you can hear in the rooms closer to the road. If you want a qui"
My wife and I were walking on the beach and stopped here to eat.  We have to say Janet the manager here made our experience amazing. She made us feel like long life friends. We had an amazing views of the water. The coffee was delicious. I ordered the avocado toast with eggs on top. Something so simple tasted amazing. We took our time and really enjoyed our entire experience. Highly recommend. 
Amazing customer service and staff! The staff truly made us feel welcome! Best customer service I’ve had when traveling! The property was beautiful almost majestic. I was very impressed by all the artwork. I would recommend Casa Malca to anyone traveling to Tulum
My first time in tulum with my best friend and it was amazing. The service was so good. Javier made us the best drinks. Can’t wait to come back soon. Our room was beautiful. The sushi on Monday was sooo good.
A lovely hotel with friendly staff! Thank you to Liz and Edbar for being so helpful. Rooms are excellent and spacious and the views from the hotel rooftop bar are sensational!  This hotel is at the heart of the hotel zone and restaurants are walking distance on the beach or through the main road
"New resort between Tulum and Riviera Maya. The lobby was beautiful with a great view of the ocean, but that was about the only positive of this place. The service was well below what you expect in Mexico. Room was cleaned, but no towels were provided; had to call 3 times and almost 2 hours later before receiving any. Left the empty tissue box out in the open, only to come back after the room was serviced to find the box sitting in the same spot, empty.  Nice touch having a Nespresso machine in the room, but"
"Wonderful experience at this hotel! I stayed here with my fiancé for the past 6 days and I can’t say enough good things. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating on every level- from helping to get Taxis, to food recommendations and more. Our room was beautiful with a view straight to the ocean and very clean! The staff works hard to keep the beach meticulous and it shows. Breakfast was included each day with our stay which was also a great addition. This was our first time to Mexico and Tulum an"
"this was the best trip i have gone on. The service and details that go on at Casa Malca are exquisite. They are friendly, fast and attentive to all guests and quick to take care of you if you need anything.   "
"This hotel was booked for for a January 2022 trip, however due to the rise of COVID cases in December/January due to Omnicron, we decided to cancel. I canceled within the timeframe of the hotels posted timeframe. We have been given the run around, transferred to accounting multiple times, was told to speak with Flavio Gonzales or Victor, no one ever answers the phone. We have spoken with Noria in reservations multiple times verbally and via email to no avail. Its May and there is still no refund."
"We went to this hotel in May (2021) and were utterly disappointed by the accommodations, staff, and a closed off beach! Prior to our arrival, we called the hotel to make sure that we have beach access and that our room is in a quiet location, which we were assured of that it would be. Once we got there, we found our room next to loud construction, the door was broken, and beach was closed to due bad seaweed! Also, the pool was the size of a tub! Their pictures are photoshopped and they are completely misrep"
" No hand held sprayer in the shower which is a very poor design, and although the rooms looked nice, the layout in general wasn't the most functional. The hallways and stairs might as well be a slip and slide, as we watched multiple people fall.  I would normally think it was the tequila that made them fall, but that couldn't have been it, since the drinks were completely watered down.  Food was ok, but I guess that is expected from all-inclusive.  Overall, left a lot to be desired.  We travel to Mexico mul"
My friends and I came here for a bachelorette party. We loved it! It’s so beautiful. Lily the manager made sure our group had the best time. I would highly recommended it. Such a great experience. The rooms are magical. The whole entire hotel has the best vibes and so many places for pictures. 10/10. Can’t wait to come back.
"Everything was magical: The jungle, the sand, the food, the beverages, the art, the rooms... The staff was very helpful and friendly The room was spacious and having a patio in the garden / jungle was very entertaining for the kiddos Will go back in a heartbeat"
"A 2 hour drive to get their from Cancun but worth it.  This is a smaller resort, adults only, and was all inclusive.  Very good food and drinks.  The staff was supper friendly especially Noemi and Jesus. There is no beach access on site but there is one close by.  the Wifi was only real issue but we could go to the lobby to access."
"My boyfriend and I went for his 30th birthday and during booking our travels we were sooo unsure of which hotel to choose, but we’re so so happy we went with Hotelito Azul. We had the most incredible time! The staff is beyond friendly and helpful and the hotel was beautiful - online pictures didn’t do it justice. We’ll definitely be back!"
We stayed at Cabanas Tulum for my friends 40th birthday. The service was impeccable from check in to check out. We had couples massages. One of the best massages I have had in some time. The breakfast each day was delicious and free. The hotel is in the perfect location right on the beach. We stayed in the ocean view room with a rooftop deck. The room was beautiful and we used the hot tub quite a bit. We would definitely return.

"We loved our stay at the Coco Tulum hotel! Staff was very accommodating to us. We both enjoyed our massages at the spa, which were also at an excellent price point. Such a great location and beautiful rooms! Very relaxing."
We celebrated our friends bachelorette party here and it was amazing! Everything was beautiful and the service was awesome. Very friendly staff. Definitely recommend. Rooms are right on the beach with a gorgeous view.
"Nice place, recomand 100%. Personal are so friendly and kind. Really recomand this place. I was in all Tulum and this place is the only one with good stuff and quality food! Also the best sushi evere ! Love casa Malca!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This was a great place to spend a well needed holiday after so much going on in our lives and after the difficulties of covid The transfer was about 2 hours from Cancun and was delayed 40 minutes but the driver was friendly  Our welcome was nice and the staff were always helpful
Visited Olivia Organic Market and had delicious and fresh coconut water! The owner is very friendly and gave my girlfriends and I a tour of hotelito  Azul. Looked absolutely amazing with stunning views of the beach. Looking forward to staying with them the next time I’m in Mexico!
My friends and I had a wonderful experience here! The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The location is perfect and the beach is quiet with lot of places to relax. We came to celebrate my birthday and the staff was so sweet with birthday cake at breakfast and champagne and decorations in our room after massages. The spa is amazing as well and super easy to book. The food at both restaurants was excellent and you get a lot ( 2 entrées and drink) I can not say enough good thing about this hotel.  Yoga 
"New resort.  Food in restaurants and room service was good. Service at restaurants and pool was very slow. The beach is filled with seaweed other than a small area. Adding a nature trail, hammocks and a quiet area would be nice. The rooms open up to pool areas. The pool area by my room was loud. Not terrible and some nice things. If you are a pool person, this resort could be for you. If you like the beach and being in nature, likely best to choose somewhere else."
"My partner and I recently visited Tulum but booked an airbnb in the jungle, aprox 20 min from the beach. On our first day in Tulum we happened upon the Coco Beach club. We loved the vibe, service, location, friendly staff, drinks and food so much that we booked a night in a garden villa, we loved that experience so much that we booked a 2nd night.  The room was perfect, cozy, steps from the beach and the incredible sunrises. The ac worked amazing and the bed provided both of us restful sleeps. There is no t"
"I would recommend Coco limited to any friends or family looking for a place to stay in Tulum. We had a beautiful room with views of the pool, beach and tropical brush. The staff created an exceptional experience for us by providing the most amazing service! They were quick to bring towels and ice to our room. They work very hard keeping the sand clean in front of the beach as well as cleaning the pathways around the hotel constantly. The breakfast every morning on the beach was fantastic (pictures), the foo"
"Casa Malca definitely exceeded my expectations.  When searching for hotels in Tulum it is difficult to decipher with all the information available.  They offer LOTS of great photo spots throughout the complex, as well as a great view at the beach.  Even considering it was the beginning of seaweed season, they had people on the beach DAILY cleaning up the beaches so that we could enjoy the views all day long.  The concierge was phenomenal, and if you don't already have WhatsApp, I recommend you download it s"
"Me and a friend just returned from a 4 nights, 5 days stay at this resort. To say that our stay was disappointing is to an understatement! Let me start by saying that I am a well-traveled individual and had chosen to stay at Kore based on reviews/photos posted. The resort is advertised as a ""4-star"" resort, after my stay I would give it 2.5 stars at best! Below is a list of unsatisfactory incidents that happened. - carts passing by with loud noise throughout the late evening into the morning - workers bangi"
Tulum is a great place to visit and this hotel made our stay exceptional. Staffs are super friendly and made themselves available at all time. They had great suggestions for things to do in the area and restaurants to try. John and Cindy were very professional managers for hotel and food/beverages.
"Stayed in #2 and enjoyed open windows and ocean breeze day and night. Rooms are super cool with stone walls and thatched roof. Safe and low key vibe with good food, but not cheap for Mexico … mind you you are on the ocean with super service and cleanliness. The private cove beach allows for nice shallow swimming if your OK with some seaweeds which are unavoidable right now on most of the Mexican east coast. No regrets and would recommend it for primarily couples even though there were some families there."
"I really enjoyed my stay at Cabanas Tulum. The room was very cute and comfortable. Had a direct path to the beach, which was only a few steps away.  The food was great.  We also enjoyed some spa treatments as well as the hydrotherapy.  The staff was absolutely amazing, so friendly and helpful.  The hotel itself is in a great spot. Very easy to get around and check out the area."
"Staff was awesome!  Dennis, Daniela and Miguel gave us 5 star service.  Property is very clean and food was outstanding!  Rooms were nicely furnished.  Wonderful pools throughout the property.  Highly recommend the Auma Steakhouse.  We will return!"
" the room smelled like a tropical drink! The outdoor space was lovely, 2 big chairs and a hammock, a perfect spot for a glass of wine and a nap after a day on the beach.   Initially I was hesitant about the shared bathroom but found it was charming with its conch shell faucets and bamboo showers, it was always clean and restocked.  The location cant be beat, close to great dining, bars, convenience stores for alcohol, sunscreen, and snacks, and a private parking lot across the street. The room rate that we "

Breakfast was included in our stay, portion sizes were generous and plenty of options to choose from! We loved how close we were to the beach and the small intimate feel of the place.

" wherever, and whenever you'd like it was totally worth it.  "
"Beautiful hotel (not 5 stars) with good service, a very tough value proposition.  Much of the reason for the 3-star review is that Tulum is a polluted noisy faux eco sham that would bring the score down for any hotel we may have stayed in.  This is one of the nicer hotels we saw on the Tulum beach strip, but by NO means a 5-star hotel by any definition of the industry standards.   The service is very good, with superstar performance by Aurelio and Cornelio on the rooftop pool/bar area and great support from"

They were both very personable, patient & kind in helping us with dining arrangements & activities. They are a huge asset to Diamante K. We really enjoyed our stay. The resort is quite idyllic in its setting & location & very close to nature, which is what we wanted. No need for an alarm clock when you have green woodpeckers outside your door.

From the time we arrived until when we left, all of the staff were extremely friendly, attentive and helpful.

" as it’s first come first serve and anyone can grab one, not just hotel guests. The service on the beach was outstanding, no need to carry cash, you can charge food and drinks to your room, but prices are more comparable to North American pricing and whether you order a virgin cocktail or not, it’s still the same price. Lots of good options nearby for dinner, but very touristy therefore you’re paying anywhere between 80-200 USD for dinner, for two. The rooms lack closet space to hang and/or fold your clothe"

"We had a blast at Mayan! Very good swimming pool and the rooms were clean. We only had a loud person in the room, but that could not bother us that much. We loved the happy hours with the drinks and also the food was good.  They even had Gewoon Boef as a special guest."
"I stayed at Diamanté K with my two friends and then solo. The setting was so true to itself - we felt immediately embedded into an authentic Tulum beach community. The staff was extremely kind and accommodating. I needed to have early check in and check outs, and they went out of their way to support all of my asks. As a solo female traveler, I felt totally safe here. The experience at diamanté K is truly unique and real, and could not recommend it more."
" noise, etc. I was apprehensive to book, but can say we did not share that experience whatsoever. If anything you can hear faint music in the distance during the day (from the beach not the room), but it wasn't offensive. The only negative to mention would be around prices, but that is the trend all along the beach in Tulum compared to anywhere else. It wasn't too outrageous, but noticeably higher everywhere. Have to give props to the bartenders here. They made some amazing drinks and provided some cool his"

It felt like our own little slice of paradise. The rooms are up to  Hilton’s high standards. I will be returning.  Hilton Tulum is a 1hr 15min ride from Cancun airport.

Great hostel close to Tulum downtown. Has a nice coworker coworking space and chill area downstairs for getting stuff done and downtime as well as an area that’s buzzing and has live music if you’re feeling like partying. Angel at the front desk was super helpful w recs on nightlife as well as transportation options around the area.
"If you want to be right by the beach, sleep with the sounds of the waves and the birds, this is your place! This is not a usual hotel comfort but it's a one of a kind experience with tasty food and a beautiful and picturesque environment. It's very close to the historic part and the popular downtown area. You can either walk or rent a bike. The staff was very nice and helpful, and they give good recommendations for your stay. "

"Had a lovely dinner by myself here. Gustavo and Federico were very attentive and friendly while I hung out on the beach with my book! I had the corn, enchiladas and a dessert. I love that there’s a coupon that can be used between the different coco hotels and just a short walk down the beach"
"Es ist das beste Hostel in tulum!!  Abbi is the kindest super visor I ever met! She helped me with so many things!! The rooms are clean, the food is great and the parties are amazing!!the people you meet are become friends for life!!!"
My husband and I stayed here for three days for our anniversary. We had such an amazing time. The bungalows are so cute and comfortable and the veiw is incredable. I won't lie I was scared reading about bugs and being hot but none of that was even a thing. With the ocean breeze and fans above the bed we were not hot at all and I didn't see a single bug inside the bungalow.  The front desk people are so helpful and nice. We rented a scooter through them which was such a good idea because the taxis are very e
"We were searching for a place that was close to places but also on the quiet, relaxing and subdued side...this place hit the mark.  We rented a beach front roof top and loved our stay.  You can go from room to beach or pool in literally seconds. The Service is TOP NOTCH. We would and are coming back."
…
"Coco beach club was the best part of our trip! Great music, food and so beautifully decorated.  Ask for Mario and you will be well taken care of! Try the tacos and cocktails, you won’t regret it.  Make sure you bring your towel if you want to swim !!"
"Aaron was very helpful and did the most to help during my stay. I would most definitely recommend The Mayan Monkey to other travelers. The hostel is clean, close to centro and other places of interest."
 anniversary.  Diamante K is 10/10 I can't wait to go back one day.
"We went to Tulum for the first time and stayed in Cabanas Tulum Beach Hotel & Spa. The stay there was everything we had dreamed of and even more! The hotel, the location, the restaurants, yoga classes and very nice&friendly personnel. To wake up with the beach front view and sounds of the waves then take a few steps for the morning swim in the sea or just sit down in a beach bed to watch the sun go up was just amazing. The breakfast was really high class and delicious healthy food. I already miss my every m"
"Came to this resort because it recently opened and was a bit of challenge to find it considering there was no signage with their name  Hilton Tulum at the front entrance?  Had to ask the guard at the gate if this was the right place and it was. Lol  After booking this resort online, I called the front desk and also emailed the resort about making advance reservations for dinner at the specialty restaurants.  Although it’s all inclusive, many of the restaurants do book up fast and you’ll be out of luck if yo"
"Coco Tulum is so beautiful! Mario helped us and he is an amazing soul! He exceeded our expectations and provided 10/10 customers service. We never had this type of friendly service anywhere, but here!   Food was delicious 10/10 Experience 10/10 Customer service 10/10 Ambiance 10/10  He made sure our group was taken care of. Highly recommend coming here and asking for Mario."
"the Mayan Monkey was my first hostel so I wasn't really sure what to expect but i'm sure they set the bar pretty high. They offered breakfast, wifi, a lovely co working session and so much more. Personally I am more of a person who requires alone time so it was not my cup of tea so do be aware that they also offer solo rooms instead of just the dorm style rooms. Pick the room thats best for you and enjoy!!"

"We went to Tulum with our family and stayed at the vanilla loft. It is a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 more beds in the attic. There are 2 bathrooms, a great private hot tub and a beautiful waterway entrance with stepping stones. The rooms have air conditioning and are very well maintained. It is very comfortable and is perfect for a family.  It is also in a great location, on the beach and walking distance to several of the best restaurants and clubs in Tulum. You can access their beach for free as a guest of"
"We stayed in T3, the honeymoon suite, which was rustically beautiful, definitely the answer to boring samey more corporate hotels that you get sick of. The room had real personality, got lots of fresh air, had a private balcony that felt quite private, and was gorgeous with is natural shower and conch shell sink. It was kept very clean, the products were nice, and there were always plenty of them. I found the king size bed and pillows very comfortable. The air conditioner worked perfectly and kept the room "
"We loved our time at dune, we spent 8 days here for our honeymoon. The entire front desk was incredibly helpful and kind. The food is amazing and rooms and overall vibe are peaceful. We will definitely be back!!!"
"Check in was a disaster then through the week it got WORSE! over charging drinks ( fluctuating prices ) rude staff, then my phone and debit card got stolen........ took 24 hours for the manager to locate it...... minus my debit card..... YOU DO THE MATH....."
"Diamante K has an incredible location - beautiful private beach and we loved being peacefully away from the main drag, however still close enough to enjoy the restaurants, bars and shops in the evenings.   Rooms are 'rustic'. We really enjoyed the fact that they are constructed ecologically and located right on the beach in a national park... however this does mean poor lighting, weak water pressure and sometimes elements from the thatched roof falling over the bathroom or suitcases. The beds were incredibl"
"Great hotel if you're looking for a place to stay in Tulum that has more amenities. The rooms are beautiful and clean with fast Wifi and AC. The hotel itself is bright and airy with food and coffee at your disposal. And a beautiful outside forest area. On top of that, it is located very close to the Cenotes and Tulum Ruins."
" recommend to book it before going, due to covid.  They also have great breakfast options at both of their restaurants (Ziggy’s and Frescos). Great for vegetarians too. "
" extra blanket, for sitting outside on the balcony when it's cool in the evening. We stopped rinsing our feet, even though there's a little bowl outside your room, because the floor is so slick when wet, I totally slipped once. Birds start calling early each morning, and because it is a thatched roof, it sounds like they are right in there with you. There was a cute little woodpecker who came up to our window and pecked most mornings. It really didn't bother me, but I think for someone who wakes easily, aft"
"Not only is this hotel an absolute dream, but the staff is beyond amazing. You have your own little slice of paradise right on the main Tulum. This place is walkable to everything (amazing restaurants, shopping, and nightlife). Can’t wait to return!"
"Great hostel for accommodation, very clean, private bed space, spacious lockers.  Don’t book external tours through them though as they never actually booked me on one, after I paid the deposit, and I spent over an hour waiting around for a tour. I tried to contact the front desk but no one answers the phone. It was a bit of a mess and created a big “downer” on my Trip. They offered to refund me and rebook however it was my last day in Mexico so I have missed out on a few things.  Also, I tried to call the "
" with great recommendations! Considering that Tulum can be incredibly busy, we felt this was our peaceful haven, and would definitely recommend it!"
"I am obsessed with Aloft Tulum. I have stayed there on 2 trips now and have received excellent accommodations, service and food on each trip. The staff is super and it's also located in the best spot easily accessing the ruins or the beach hotels and the pueblo / cenotes alike! Will always recommend this hotel to friends/family traveling to Tulum. x"
"Loved our stay at Dreams in Tulum. Big resort, quality food and drinks, lots of fauna (iguanas) onsite. Beach view was picturesque. International buffet food was great! the only thing that was lacking was - they offer golf carts ride from check-in area but they were never available."
"We LOVED the Dune Hotel!! In fact we plan to come back again. We've even recommended it already to some of our friends. From the beginning to the end our trip we enjoyed all of it. The food was great, the massages we had were the BEST, so relaxing and the views...WOW!!  The staff were the nicest...The whole vibe of this hotel felt like home away from home.  We can't stop raving about the staff. Frank and Carlos who work in the restaurant were the best. The cocktails they recommended were amazing...even gave"
"Not all facilities was working (like safe in the private room) The price for privet room is too high, the staff didn’t clean though we put the sign, the sheets was the same the entire stay. The staff was all about the money in a way that when we ask for some ice they wanted to charge it extra, water as well. When we asked for new pool towels because no one changed ours the staff made us go to the room and bring the old ones (WTF) The stay was bad and we wouldn’t recommend this place!"
"I’ve stayed at this hostel twice and each time I had a really great experience. Staff is very nice, rooms are clean and the beds very comfy. The bar and pool area is super nice and a great place to meet other travellers. I highly recommend this hostel :) "
…
We had a great time at Aloft hotel where we had stayed in a King Room for few nights. I really recommend this hotel if you are willing to stay in Tulum. The room was really beautiful  and it has all your needed amenities. Aloft has a wide option for international breakfast and you can order your favorite breakfast with hot or cold drink. They also have a rooftop pool and restaurant. The hotel offers you a great hospitality and excellent service. Would love to visit again!
"Building and facilities need a lot of work, the service is poor and the food is sub-par. The location is convenient to the excursions but it is also at a location where the water is very rough and too much seaweed to be able to enjoy the ocean."
 not of fan of music don't stay here. If you want quiet look for another hotel. For us the music was never an issue. We actually enjoyed it.  It starts up around 11am when the rest of the city comes alive and doesn't stop until 2 or 3 in the morning.   Our room had a its own mini pool which was kept nice and cool always. We loved having our own little hang out.   The only con I can say about this hotel is the plumbing which is not the hotels fault.   Stop looking and book your stay here!!
"This was the best place I stayed during my whole trip to Mexico, -the hostel looks more like a hotel, the staff is wonderful and the vibe makes it feel like home very easily. Big thank you to Mauricio and Franco! "
This was the second time I stayed at the aloft tulum (first time was with family and now with a friend) and I don’t regret it at all!  Ever since we crossed the door of the hotel we were treated super well by the people on the front desk and everyone in general.  I can say my fav part of the hotel is the rooftop. My friend and I would go there everyday and just chill and enjoy the view while we recharged energy at the end of the day. I also really liked that they had a DJ on the weekend.  The hotel also had
The bath tub was not working. the mini fridge was not working on my arrival time. I spend over two hours late @ night waiting for the maintenance worker to fix the bath tub and the fridge. They fix the tub and the fridge the next day. The nigh manager offered a better room the next day but he did not keep his promise.
"We were originally supposed to go to The Beach Tulum in March 2020… and we all know how that went. Finally, 2 years later, we were able to make it. My friends, I have found paradise and I wish I never had to leave. Five stars.  The good: - The resort itself is just magic. Magic. It feels like you have it all to yourself. There are only 28 rooms, and we had a junior suite with the private plunge pool, so it was secluded and private and perfect.  - The room is amazing. Air conditioned so you can get out of th"

"My friends visited Tulum one week before I did and they had some trouble with other hotels but discovered Dune by the end of their stay. Thankfully they gave me this recommendation!! I had an amazing time-my room was stylish and most importantly, I didn’t see a single bug or mosquito in it. If you are the type who suffers with mosquitoes, do yourself a favour and book Dune because you’ll be really happy. On top of that, the staff is wonderful- really kind, helpful, attentive, and personable. I felt like I w"
 around by walking distance as well.  Thank you and hopefully I can visit  again soon!
"The resort itself is unbelievably beautiful and very clean. Gorgeous views, gardens, and fountains. I've stayed other places where the trash bins were overflowing for days. This is not the case at Dreams. Not one piece of trash in sight.   The staff are all so friendly. We didn't encounter even one rude staff member and they all went out of their way to make you feel welcome. Ricky, Pablo, Manon, and the other girl who was a dancer were SO fun. Sandoval in the cabana area was great. Gabby at the salon was w"
" you can sit on and dip your toes in the water!  - the regular pools! Fun to bounce around. - the spa!!!! We got two 90-minute massages because my fiancé is perfect and loves to spoil us. I was dealing with so much neck pain from two pandemic years. After this vacation? Gone.  - the beach!!! Warm water, gorgeous ocean. We went during seaweed season and even when other parts of the beach were overrun, the beach at The Beach (lol) was the cleanest and clearest of all. Gorgeous sparkling waters for us. - room "
"Dune catered to all our needs. The team here helped in every aspect of all our requests, from a daily iron to them giving me their personal Bluetooth speaker each night so we could get ready with music.   Loraine, Edgar and Luis were our main contacts and worked together as team to accommodate our needs. It is a nice boutique hotel located conveniently across a 24 hour mini mart (beers and all other essentials including subway which we did not have). On the same street are so many places to eat, party, hook"

 were a group of Americans who did NOT want American food while there; we wanted authentic Mexican food and what we got wasn't great. The resort had a few Mexican fiesta nights that were very good. The food at Portofino was excellent. It was just strange for the Italian food to be better than the Mexican food while in Mexico. The food at El Patio and the room service food definitely need improving.   I had a few small hiccups with the AC in our room and our room key. I believe while traveling that things ha

" was on point. The only disappointment, which had absolutely nothing to do with Dune was the Dan seaweed on the beach… thank you very much Dune -"
"We stayed at this hotel last month and we only have good things to tell about it. The room was big and clean, love the decor. The breakfast was the best, a lot of things to choose. The pools are beautiful, in particular the infinity pool in the rooftop. The staff is always ready to help in everything. They also have bikes to rent, and we had so much fun exploring Tulum with the bikes, is the best way.  We had a lovely stayed and I recommended for sure!! Thank you so much Aloft for make this days so perfect."
…
I really loved this resort.  The staff was so friendly and accommodating.  The restaurants were fantastic.  Ziggys was right on the beach with entertainment nightly. A special thank you to the staff at Frescos who made our breakfasts a special part of our day.  We ate almost all of our meals at the resort when we realized the quality and freshness just couldn't be beat!  Great vegetarian and vegan options.  The beach is amazing and the property is well kept.  No shoes necessary here!  The location was the b

"I had a great 5 night stay in April.  The breakfast and rooftop poolside restaurant were both good.  I opted in for a resort fee (you can elect to start any night of your stay) and it included food and beverage credits, daily shuttle to 2 drop offs along the beach, one very close to the archaelogical zone, and some other nice perks.  I also made use of the gym, rooftop pool, and free bike rentals, all of which were great.  The staff was excellent overall, particularly Enrique at the front desk and Filiberto"
I recommend Dreams Tulum. The service and options were excellent. One problem for me loving the ocean was the Seaweed both on the beach and shore made swimming near impossible. The result is packed with amenities and options that are included. I didn’t get to take advantage of all of them which speaks volumes. The personnel consistently awesome! 
 easy.  Any request is made with a prompt reply.  I can't say enough about the concierge.  They were on top of everything we needed!  Our room was the king bedroom on the beach and we were so close!  There is nothing I can say bad about this hotel.  We will definitely stay here again.  It was our first time to Tulum and what a great first visit!
We stayed at this hotel in november 21 for one night and found it disappointing and poor value for money - not up to the standard of the other hotels we stayed at in Mexico and definitely not 5 star. The room was basic with damp on the ceiling and the furnishings were of poor quality.  I would not recommend
" staying on the beach is not a priority (and it is currently covered with seaweed on the shoreline and not very swimmable anyhow so you'd need to find a nice beach club with a pool, like Mia)."
I found the resort below average and the food was awful.  Paid for an oceanfront room and the pool and bar was right outside the balcony.  It was really loud.  Did not feel like there was much value in the Preferred package.

"Don’t waste your money at this hotel, there are MUCH nicer hotels in the area for even a lower price and better service and food. There is nothing 5 stars about this place. The super 8 motel are cleaner and nicer than Dreams Tulum. "
"We travel the world often and look for the best hotels wherever we travel. We enjoyed The Beach Hotel for so many reasons. The staff is exceptionally helpful with all our requests. It’s a small, luxury hotel with rooms directly on the beach. The rooms are charming, comfortable and very clean. We had a patio with a jacuzzi, lounge chairs and a bed on a private deck above our bedroom. The hotel is on a white sandy beach within walking distance to excellent restaurants and shops. The concierge made reservation"
"This was the greatest experience I had in my life. Our wedding coordinator planned the wedding of our dreams almost entirely via email. She made everybody so simple and easy, she answered all of my questions and executed the wedding of our dreams! The experience was unforgettable, the entire wedding guest list didn’t want to leave, we all had the time of our lives!"
"The moment we arrived we were blown away by this hotel. The service, the hospitality, the room!!!! Really a relaxing couples vacation.  Relaxing is an understatement. Was so quiet and calming. The pool outside the room, the plunge poop in the room. The room service to the beach. The restocking thr fridge with complimentary waters and nuts. The spa. The complimentary sauna and cold and got pools. The watsapp service. We got complimentary strawberries in chocolate and petals on our bed as we were baby mooning"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our recent stay at The Beach Tulum. The few criticisms that I do have below are simply because there are many hotel options nearby that would deliver a similar (or better) experience for less $$.  Accommodations: We selected a room on the second level that included a rooftop pool/jacuzzi, but never ended up using it as there was no shade and we preferred to be out on the beach at Ziggy's. In hindsight, now seeing that the rooms on the main floor were not accessible from a busy beach ar"
" and beauty of the common area. Thank being said, if you are a person who likes to hang around a pool vs. the beach, this is probably not the place for you as I think we only saw people actually around the pool one time. It's more of an aesthetic feature than an actual swimming pool.  Location: Very convenient + central location for walking to various restaurants, beach clubs, etc. Not specific to The Beach Tulum, but we were surprised that the main road was not better designed for pedestrians and biking.  "
"I booked the hotel for 4 nights however I left and changed for another resort because I had very bad experience.  The hotel staff is very unskilled. Due to their poor knowledge, I had heavy accident (the staff placed the bastet with water, to wash the feets in the middle of the road under the stairs from the room, which is impossible to see in the night).   The hotel neither apologize for that. However I had to undergo several doctor’s visits and I had completely ruined holiday due to this matter.  The hote"
" answer. They should refund the money within 36 days since I left, that’s what they told me when I went away.   So the hotel neither apologized for what happen, neither offered compensation, neither paid for the medical expanses I had due to them BUT they also did not refund me my money which they have to refund as my reservation allowed the refund!  Absolutely horrible experience.  And Note also, that there is noise in the rooms (from the night clubs) for the entire night."
"Azulik is an experience which shouldn’t be missed. The place, food and service is fantastic! The tseen-ja restaurant was a highlight! And especially the team along with Luciano who was our attendant for the night made it a memorable experience. Luciano also brought us a special cake to celebrate my wife’s birthday on such short notice! Kudos to the team at azulik!"
…
"Luis Miguel’s service at Kin Toh was incredible. While staying at Azulik, we hadn’t made reservations for dinner and the restaurant was fully booked. But he quickly found a space for us, and even though he was juggling many other responsibilities through our dinner, served impeccably. In addition to the service, the food was amazing. The lamb, venison, short ribs, and everything else were perfection. Highly recommend!"
Highly recommend Ahau to anyone. The ocean view room was very beautiful. The staff was all friendly and good to us. They made us feel at home and did an Amazing job with everything. The food and drinks are delish!!  Tanet was very helpful in getting our reservations going. The staff decorator my room beautiful for my bday. Javier was very helpful in showing us how to get to Daniel Popper art work. Loved everything bout it. Although I wouldn’t recommend visiting in May because it’s extremely hot and the seaw
"Santos and Gilberto were amazing waiters!! Beautiful place, food is good, vibes are immaculate. Would love go come back - so so so cool! :) our groups loved it and will come back and get a nest! Be sure to wear flat shoes, heels are hard on the wood."
I have stayed at Ahau Multiple Times and Every time is even better than the previous.  Room number 4 is spectacular and the view is incredible. The food is to die for and so are the drinks. Every worker is happy all the time and that shows how the employees are treated . Literally Ahau us a Piece is Heaven . Highly recommended ☺️
Phenomenal service from Gilberto and Santos! Our whole group loved the ambiance and the food was delicious. I would definitely come back but reserve a nest next time! The photo ops were all so great too!
"First of all, let us thank Jesus at the outdoor bar for welcoming us and making us feel like family. We had just finished getting a workout in at the outdoor gym up the beach and when walking down spotted the Ahau beach bar. We sat down for a drink and Jesus came right over to help us out. He was super informative, super welcoming and such a great guy.  A few drinks turned into a lot of drinks, some of the best food we have ever eaten in Mexico in 15 years of coming down and by far and wide the best day tri"

"Lovely place, we really wanted to extend. Spacious and  great restaurant inside. Food was great and plenty of healthy options. Beautiful pool inside and infinity pool, daily yoga classes. Staff helpful and super friendly. There was always someone at the front desk who was happy to help. Private jacuzzi was fabulous just outside the room."
" the playlist but they deserve a bonus.  When we finally decided to leave, Jesus got us towels and told us all about the events that take place across the year with fun parties that we should come and check out. That's exactly what we're doing, as we spent the entire rest of our vacation in our all-inclusive resort wishing we were back at Ahau and planning a trip to revisit immediately. Sadly for our all-inclusive resort it is doubtful we ever return.  Thanks Jesus and the Ahau team and we can't wait to be "

They have a special spot on the roof, with infinity pool and an open bar where they play music by night , wow..delicious drinks with authentic mezcal . Thanks Claudia, our super host !"
Esau & Marco were excellent! The service we got was 5 stars. They were super attentive and were always on point suggesting drinks and food! We always comeback to this place because its beautiful and we love how warm people is. Definetely we'll keep on coming back!

"The service at this place is absolutely awful, the staff are rude, unprofessional and obnoxious. They think they are doing you a favor letting you dine at the place.   I had to constantly email them to ask that they could confirm the booking after paying £1500.00 to reserve the tables and every time they replied back with incorrect information and didn't not put a contact name who was dealing with it.  On the day we arrived at 4.50pm our booking was at 5pm, the door staff were rude acted like gangsters and "
"This hotel exceeded my expectations! I’m not one to write reviews but Immediately upon arriving the Copal team made us feel at home. All personnel were friendly.

Truly a reason to go back. He personally had them set up a surprise of chocolate covered strawberries and bubbly in our apartment. He maintained contact with us dur"

There's a central restaurant overlooking the sea. More like a hub where everyone can meet. Food is excellent. I had some great meals.    The beach is so relaxing where you can slumber on one of their day beds. Watching the waves of the sea is bliss.  I had the most beautiful room. All small details are thought of. Plunge pool included. With a wonder"
"We stayed one night in the upper Bali Hut room and fell in love with Ahau and Tulum   We took the transportation from Cancun recommended by Ahau. They waited at the wrong hotel & we had to call so pick up was late, but the drive was great. The driver was so friendly. He lives in Tulum and was giving us all of his recommendations and told us all about Tulum.   The check in process was okay. Someone was in the office (only one check in at a time) so we had to wait, but that was no problem for us. The staff se"
"My boyfriend and I just spent a week at Villa Pescadores in Tulum. Absolutely attentive staff, they definitely go the extra mile. We can recommend staying here, we definitely enjoyed it.  However, please bear in mind that this hotel is rather secluded, which we actually deemed as great. However this means that you either need to take a bicycle (still takes a lot of time, and it's hot), an expensive taxi (believe me, you'll be shocked, but that's Tulum for you), or, the best option: Rent a car."
"Top day at the beach club food was class, drinks were class all the people who served us were great, Raphael our main waiter was top draw, top bloke along with his pal David and not to mention isai and honer, some boys. Would defo recommend and would also love to go again."

"We dined at Maratea our last night in Mexico and could not have been more pleased with the service or the food. Our server Ernesto was attentive all evening without being intrusive. We started with the beef carpaccio and the pumpkin seed humus. Both were excellent. I had the seafood soup next. Presentation and preparation were both perfect. The broth was well-developed and pouring it over the shrimp, clam, mussels, and fish at the table and then combining it with the crouton made it fun and whimsical. My wi"

 she also stopped by our table a couple of times. She also handled an uncomfortable situation with some rude customers at a different table with grace and professionalism.

We rented bikes to go to the main Tulum area (very accessible) and to the ruins (right next door). The breakfast was fantastic and coffee was delivered to our room each morning. I wouldn’t have changed anything and will definitely come back. Thank you!!"

Paco was amazing he attended to all our needs and was very helpful to anything that we needed we felt safe and he went above and beyond and was on call through communication he had great recommendations and he and the other staff was also very nice to us if we had any issues he made us feel like we were home for a few days i will be back to see them very soon
"Spacious clean rooms, we did have hot water and a very powerful shower. The staff were friendly but they did look as though they needed a shower No breakfast here but we found a very good place near by"
…
Words do not do PPP justice. Our friend group litigated hotel options for weeks before giving the edge to PPP. We have been truly blown away. Ignacio specifically went above and beyond in ensuring we were taken care of. He upgraded our room to a beautiful villa with jaw dropping views. Fernanda was also key in making our stay unforgettable.
"From the moment we were picked up at the airport from Albierto to the greeting we received at arrival 5 star service.  ZAAMA was so helpful the entire stay,  whatever we needed she was able to help us.  ZAAMA recommended the best restaurants to eat and made special accommodations at each restaurant to celebrate our anniversary.   So delighted that the reviews I read when selecting where to stay were absolutely spot on.   We will be coming back often.   The rooms are so clean and the view is absolutely beaut"
"Rusel, great waiter!! Kept attention to detail! Come visit you won’t be disappointed!!!!! I would recommend the margarita pizza. And the margarita salvaje is to die for. The food overall was delicious and so was the presentation was amazing."
"Great service from Rafael!! 5 stars! Very friendly and accommodating, helped us get everything we needed and more. Will def be coming back here soon to enjoy this beautiful place. 10/10 recommend. ((:"
The service at this hotel is phenomenal. They are so attentive and considerate! I enjoyed my interactions with all of the workers from the time we arrived. It is also one of the most relaxing places I have been. Would definitely come back again!
"I paid about $26 for one night. Motel has a fine location, an affordable price, and the spacious rooms are actually clean and decent with A/C. But...they don't accept credit cards, they do not have hot water in the shower (I asked the guy if they had hot water, and he said ""yes."" They don't), and there is a bar in the courtyard which had noisy patrons which disturbed me late at night AND early in the morning...  It's a shame: if they took credit cards, if they had at least warm water, and if there was no no"
Skip this place.  Staff still friendly and helpful. Access blocked by street work. Rooms suffering from tracked mud and termites have a good start on eating the place.  It had been a suitable and good bargain; it isn't any more.
"Recently opened, the Conrad Tulum in Akumal is a true gem on the beautiful Mayan Riviera.  The entire staff was welcoming, gracious, and expertly trained.  As the hotel just recently opened, it was running at low occupancy for the period I was there, so it really felt as though I had a private resort all to myself,  this will change in the near future I'm sure.  The main takeaway I would like to convey about the Conrad, and a feature which separates the property from other resorts in the area is that it is "
The hotel was very nice and the staff was fantastic.  Erick and Pasquale specifically took great care of us at the restaurant.  We had a beautiful ocean view room.  We also did the yoga class on a Friday morning and it was very enjoyable.  We definitely recommend.
"Es un hotel muy limpio y muy bien cuidado. Es atendido por sus propietarios que se esmeran por qué te la pases bien. Te dan pequeños tours a sus viñedos (no muy lejos de ahí) y a pequeñas presas, donde se acumula agua de un ojo cercano. No tiene alberca, ni estacionamiento, h el internet es intermitente. Si te quieres desconectar del mundo, aquí."
"Had an absolutely fantastic stay with my partner at la zebra, truly felt like a home from home. Rooms are spacious, stylish and clean and even the garden view has a fantastic view of both the garden and the sea. Bed is huge and very comfortable!   The staff at la Zebra are INCREDIBLE. We especially felt welcomed by Armando and Miguel in the restaurant, who served us using our first names, Elliott and the other bartenders at Mulberry Project and by Joss, Zaama and Juan Carlos at the front desk. Nothing was t"
"Servicio excelente, con vista al mar. Excelente comida y presentación de los platos. Rico! We loved out experiences and will definitely be back soon. Many places with shade and clean bathrooms! Love it"
"Gracias a Miguel, David, Isai y Primitivo.. Servicio mas excelente.. (Great service!!)  Ignacio was the best bartnender.. I recommend to ask for all of them if you come to the beach club.. Great food and Drinks"
"My stay was magical, the ambience was jungle vibes, serene peace, the staff are very friendly and helpful. I traveled solo and didn’t have to worry about anything. I had a massage out by the pool in a cabana style area, that sealed the deal. The food was excellent seasoned well proportioned just right and the prices were so reasonable. Overall I recommend Copal Hotel 100%"
"In una zona defilata rispetto alla cittadina, l'hotel si trova in un'area piuttosto selvaggia. Struttura essenziale ma architettonicamente la trovo splendida. Direttamente sul mar di Cortez in uno scenario naturale unico. Dotato di tutti i confort, in primis A/C efficiente visto che ci troviamo nella parte più calda (la zona di Loreto) di una zona (la Baja California - Mexico) di per sé caldissima. 37° all'1.30 di notte è esplicativo... ma vedere i delfini che di notte vengono a saltellare nel tratto di mar"
"Beautiful beachside property, but run down and needs major maintenance.   What a shame to let such a great property fall to ruin!   It was depressing.   The restaurant was open for breakfast and lunch.   Breakfast was good."
This motel is in a small side street and so us quiet but you miss the wonderful sunrises over the Sea of Cortez. The rooms are simple but comfortable and ensuite. Beds and linen are clean on arrival but unless you ask you may not get a daily service. The outside covered bar is a nice space. Nothing wrong with the hotel but nothing to entice us back again.
" course menu) to Ukai (edo style sushi/omakase) to Arbolea for breakfast was remarkable.  Both Autor and Ukai are well deserving of a Michelin star at each location, I would highly encourage visitors to order the set course menus at each and you will be well-rewarded.  I had a number of requests throughout my stay, each expertly handled by their superb concierge named Angel via text/IM.  Jonathan, Marcos and Victoria also did a wonderful job making me feel at home when I was dining on my own at the property"
"Had an incredible breakfast with Eric & Juan at Papaya Playa. Presentation was beautiful, food was great and the view was perfect. Eric and Juan provided some of the best service of our trip. Great vegetarian and healthy options. We will be back!!!!"
" beyond than normal on the day of our checkout when my partner became very unwell (through no fault of the hotel!) they were fantastic in helping us extend our check out time as long as possible, then finding us a place to sit and shower whilst we waited for a doctor that they organised. The doctor was excellent and him coupled with the hospitality of the hotel meant we could make our flight home! Thank you so much for an amazing stay all at La Zebra!!!"
Just returned from a 4 day stay at Villa Pescadores.  Ended up extending my stay by one day because I just couldn't leave.  Very well appointed rooms for the price.  Loved that it had a little refrigerator to keep some cold drinks on hand.  Beds were so comfortable that it was hard to get out of bed in the morning.  I had some of the best sleeps ever here.  Staff was amazing - nothing was too big of an ask for them and everyone was pleasant and accommodating.  Breakfast was delicious and the tacos govbenore
"Isai was very very helpful and nice, So was Rafael. Really enjoyed our time here. Great access to the beach and very comfortable sun beds. Would deffo recommend for anyone who would like a nice relaxing time under the sun."
"This trip was so amazing, the staff was so amazing the food was so amazing everything was so amazing our host claudio was the sweetest person I’ve EVER met ! Everything was so amazing would definitely come back"
"I have stayed at the Camino Real, now the Loreto Bay Inn many times. It is never very crowded and the rooms are very nice. Nice beach and pool areas. There are 2 bars and 2 restaurants for drinks and food. The food is good but the prices are a little high.   The property is very clean, modern and so are the rooms. Only a few miles out of Loreto but worth the trip. The staff was very helpful and friendly."
"Shocked to know that this Desert Inn is owned and operated by the government of Mexico. 7 friends and I (fishing trip) took a chance on it and discovered it was all we had hoped for and more...at about half the price we expected.  Beautiful facilities: a waterfront location on the sand beach of the Sea of Cortez...perfect. Staff was friedly and very helpful. The restaurant’s food was sub-par but the wait staff was frienly, accomodating and cheerful. I’m going back!"
"Typical 2 star budget hotel, the problem I had was that the clerk assured me that they had hot water  which turned out to be untrue.... if you do not mind lukewarm to cool showers then by all means stay there... 500 pesos a night which is a fair price... moved out after 2 nights into a step up as I require hot showers."
…
Andres and Luis were very attentive and very welcoming. Andres is very knowledgeable about the drinks and explained to me the difference between Mezcal and Tequila….now I know haha. Mezcal is the winner!! Very good service and they made sure that you are having a good time.

"Just returned from a 5 day stay at Villa Pescadores. If you are looking for a quiet spot in a beautiful jungle setting, this place is for you. The location is beautiful— loved the private front porch and hammocks. Coffee service delivered to your porch every morning is a special treat. The rooms are great— comfortable beds and pillows. The staff works hard to help you with your needs.  Oh…and the “welcome drink” is a fantastic cocktail. Thank you to the staff…Lily and Quique in the office. A big shout out t"
"Great location and amazing staff. Basic amenities in the room. We had a shared pool which was cool. The hotel offers beach beds and towels, the beach is breathtaking! Do not recommend having breakfast in the hotel; the cafeteria is way below expectations."
"I had a great time at copal! The place is so beautiful! The staffs that work their are the best!!! They took care of I and my friends! Edris was the best he helped us with ideas on places to go and made sure we got all we needed he went out of his way for us a lot. Edris is a really great person that is very committed to his job and gives the best customer service! When you get to copal please ask of him to have the best experience! Miguel and Andreas were also helpful. Honestly, I believe most of the staff"
"we stayed at the camino real for three nights last week. at first i was apprehensive because of the bad reviews i had read here. when i got there it was so beautiful! it was extremely CLEAN (which is very unusual for mexico). the rooms were very spacious and the bathrooms were AMAZING. once again, VERY CLEAN & modern! i did have some baby ants on my bed but that was quickly fixed my moving the bed away from the wall. the baby ants were coming out of a crack on the ground and climbing up the bed. after i mov"
"My husband and I met some friends in Loreto for a weekend visit. We stayed in the Desert Inn and found it to be well located and very clean. The rooms are very spacious with good amenities; shower, coffee, blankets, pillows, etc... The restaurant was good and the employees were great! I would definitely stay here again!"
Basic Motel Style with a convenient courtyard seating area.  the rooms were clean.  The bed was comfortable. everything was clean. nice large shower and free wi- fi but didn't work good in my room. this is a good value for the price .This Hotel  is located near the center of town. You can walk 2 blocks to the Ocean. The old mission is about three long blocks walk away. Located on a quiet side street so you may drive past if you are not watching.
"This is our third visit to this motel. We were the only ones there this time. I think there is only about 5 or six rooms. There is a bar/restaurant that was not open this time, right on the property. I'm sure they would have opened for us, because they are so accommodating. The room was very clean and the air conditioning worked nicely. Oh, and they allowed pets, as we travel with a small Brussels Griffon."
"Service was amazing from day one. Ocean view rooms are beautiful,  spacious and view from the balcony is amazing. Special shout out to George and the room service staff  for quick, professional and friendly service."
"Came here with my friends and Ignacio made our experience AMAZING! He was very welcoming from the get-go and made all the difference in the experience. The other staff was also amazing, but we really owe it to Ignacio. Thank you so much man!!!"
This place is absolutely fantastic! The quality of service is beyond anything I’ve ever experienced at any other hotel. Ignacio truly made sure everything about our first Tulum experience was perfect. He was very professional and friendly in welcoming us to the property and really took care of us. The accommodations will blow you away!
Rooftop penthouse was beautiful and well appointed. Private transportation from the airport was dependable and professional. Staff was very welcoming and provided excellent service. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality!
"Although the beach was filled with seaweed.  The vibe, music food and drinks made up for it.  Try out the flor cocktail and the short rib tacos, you will not regret it.  Highly recommended some of the best prices on the beach"
"This is probably my 5th or 6th stay at Ana Y Jose. I love it that much. The customer service is top notch. The location is prime. The grounds are so beautiful. The food is fantastic! The drinks are tasty. I've stayed at almost all the different type of suites and can honestly say, that from the smallest to the largest, I was never disappointed. "
"My friend & I are fisherman and Coco's worked out very well for us. I've been visiting Loreto for about 10yrs for the fishing & stayed at many different places but Coco's may be the best value in town. It's only about a 5+ minute walk to the marina which saved us cab fare. Eva, the manager was so helpful in helping us obtain a Covid test & Stephen picked up our test results too. Thank you very much!  This place is very clean , quiet (no roosters crowing), & everything works in the room. I definitely would r"
"Excellent clean room with wonderful views, just on the northern edge of town.  Very little English spoken. There is an attractive swimming pool but weather wasn't suitable for swimming.  It was a real bargain."
"We really enjoyed this hotel. It is right on the beach and walking distance to the Malecon. There was one other couple staying there so we were really surprised no one else was staying there! Only downside was no one that worked there could speak any English. Not even a little bit. Otherwise, we really enjoyed the breakfast in the restaurant and the stay was very good. "
"El Dorado is a basic little motel located just a block away from the Malecon/ the beach in Loreto. A economical choice among the pricey hotels surrounding the downtown and beach area. The hot water usually works in the evenings and the motel is located on a quiet side street, so no need for earplugs. They have a few parking spots which is a plus if you are driving."
"I have stayed at the El Dorado seven times over the years, the latest this last weekend 9/21-9/23. Always clean rooms with great air-conditioning, the staff is helpful and friendly (to the extreme). I fly groups of fishermen down to Loreto and always recommend that they stay hear. It's family owned and run and while small it's quite safe with good food within a short walk. Larry"
"This is located in the very best place in Loreto for a vacation without  needing a car, El Tiburon Casitas is a hidden gem. Small, clean pool, fiber optic internet , fully stocked kitchens, although I recommend eating out- lots of good choices all in easy walking range, friendly staff, free bikes, movies, and phone calls. Be sure to check you the library and the common area is a great place to meet your Casita “neighbors”. Liz the owner, is a resource for anything.   Warning! do not try to get availability "
"Absolutely stunning property! The people and the service we will remember the most! From Milagros, the very nice concierge, who kept in contact throughout are journey and to the housekeeping staff who always cleaned our room. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. was exemplary, professional, courteous, and genuinely warm. I have never received such amazing Customer Service on that level before. Such a delight! Beautiful location. Mind blowing spa! (Do the nopal treatment!) I said the people and the service is what we will"
"This place is top notch! Flew in with a few friends and they took care of us right away. Excellent room service and vibes. Papaya Playa is a perfect combination of relaxing, nature and nightlife.   One employee to name specifically was Ignacio. It was our first time in Tulum and he was a huge help in getting our room set up and teaching us about the city layout.   Thanks again Ignacio!"
My fiancé and I had the most amazing stay at La Zebra. We stayed in a garden suite with plunge pool and it could not have been more perfect. The plunge pools are also heated giving us our own personal hot tub.   La Zebra is slightly south of the party zone which was such a relief when we got there. We were able to walk about 8 minutes up the beach to the restaurants and clubs but it was quiet enough at La Zebra to get a relaxing sleep.   La Zebra also has a partnership with the Mulberry Project pop up bar s
Lovely place! Food was delicious and Ross was a wonderful server. Sucks that the beach has so much seaweed this time of year but still a great place to relax and quite a few people around. Would recommend!
"Our stay at Ana y José was a wonderful time away and the beach service from Rafael and David was amazing. They were kind, attentive and surprised us with a special birthday treat unprovoked. Thank you again for taking such good care of us!"
"If you stay more than once, CC will get in your blood, and you will be back!  I am always amazed that, every visit, there is always someone we know from previous visits. Many are like us, with repeat stays. The level of repeat visitors should be something to note. Great owner, staff, location, accommodations, and “vibe”! The words “homey, but private” come to mind. Accommodations are simple, but more than adequate, after all, you’re not in Loreto to sit in your room! Staff can assist you with anything you n"
"We were hoping to recreate our wonderful experience at Desert Inn in San Ignacio. Not so!!!! The staff could have cared less that we were there, asked for a ground level room, got one on second floor because there were only two rooms occupied so they just put us next to the other rooms for their convenience! Went to eat in their restaurant and were given old chicken because that was all they had! Will never return! We do not need fancy but travel for many reasons and dealing with people who are not trained "
"Our room was clean and comfortable.  A couple things in our room didn't work right, but were being fixed and the people managing the motel were very accomodating and helpful.  The motel is close to everything in town.  We could easily walk to anywhere in Loreto from the motel.  The service was good and the people friendly.  I liked  staying there. There is a cute little girl who I think lives there. "
" website. This is the best Resort in Loreto for a small intimate setting. Min age for kids is 12 so no little kids in the pool. Covid testers come to the hotel for quick testing pre departure.  Room Tip:  All rooms  similar around the pool and patio, Ask for Double Casita #1 or 4 if you need 2  beds."
" exceptional. Pardon my spelling, but I would like to thank Javier, Graciasilliano, Sarena, Abraham, Giovanni, and Jesus. The most delightful, friendly, and fun staff we have ever encountered! Your property is blessed because of them. Also, Milagros. She was the first contact we had before, during, and after our stay. Professional, friendly, and efficient. Also, Maria who works in Arbolea,(breakfast restaurant) was very accommodating and always gave us our favorite table. The cooks and staff was amazing as "
"We came two days in a row to the beach club and had a wonderful experience. Rodolfo was so helpful and charismatic. My boyfriend wanted a guava cocktail, but he said they were out of guava. He came back a few minutes later with guava’s he had picked fresh and made us guava margaritas! Beautiful location and kind staff. Thank you Rodolfo and Erick."
"this hotel was recommended by another hotel owner in Baja, and it certainly didn't disappoint. It was very clean and super centrally located in the town centre. The hotel room was very spacious with two huge double beds, which were the most comfortable beds we had slept on in a long time! The hotel complex was very tastefully decorated and had a true holiday vibe to it. The staff were very efficient and friendly. I would definitely come here again and can highly recommend it. It's on my favourite list :-)"
"We stayed at this beautiful accommodation for 2 weeks and enjoyed every minute. The location is extremely peaceful, a little oasis of heaven. The beach club was perfect with amazing food and drinks. The staff were incredibly friendly, courteous and efficient, nothing was too much trouble. Special shout out to Russell, who made us feel special from day one and does his job with pride and enjoyment. Thank you to all and we look forward to returning one day :)  "
"Amazing service! Rafael at the beach, Antionio, and jaavy, all Extraordinary service. The food is great, the service is excellent. The beach had some  seaweed but the hotel works hard at clearing it out. We didn’t do any sightseeing we just hung and the beach and pool for seven days!"
" than expecting it should “just be there”!  Like most non-corporate businesses in Loreto, Stephen and staff will make every effort to deliver on a request."
Take time to rest and calm your mind. The bed was very spacious and the lady looked after me very well. I highly recommend it . One block from the boardwalk and Orlandos restaurant near Calvary chapel Loreto
"A surprise at $47 a night for my honey and our two pups. I thought it would be twice that. That was a posted price, so not an odd moment. Nice pool, great restaurant and service. Huge double porch area. Room had a lot of space.  Open a sliding glass door to the covered porch and walk on the very long beach until you're tired, then turn and go back. At the end of the  malecón beach, so less noise.  Wake up to a gorgeous sunrise pouring in.   Hardly anyone there when we were there in February, 2017. A very sh"

"It was a lovely little hotel very centrally located.  Close to a few shops and some restaurants.  Very clean, quiet and staff very friendly!!! Loved the place and location. Also within walking distance of the Marina and parking was very easy."
…
I stayed there.  I was on a boat for 2 weeks and needed a shower and wifi.  It was quaint clean friendly and quiet.  There was  a place for me to read outside my room I could walk to the beach and I could walk to the circle where the bus picked me up  heading North.
"It is very clean, air conditioning included, confortable and lovely posada. The staff is very kind and willingness to help you. It is very close to the Malecon & to the port where all the tours exit. There are stores & restaurants to eat around everything at 2-5 minutes walking distance. They have free filtered water and coffee (all the mornings). They cover the basics for travelers at a very good value."

"El Tiburon Casitas are the nicest and best located Casitas in Loreto! The studio type rooms are completely equipped and kept spotless by daily maid service. Pool is small but lovely. You get what you pay for and this is true here, not the cheapest but worth it. This was my second visit and new this year compared to last year's visit is high speed internet, all new comfy beds, fresh paint and some new artwork inside.  Also my room had a new larger refrigerator and a new AC/Heater which was whisper quiet and "

If you show up at the hotel, it's about 1380.  If you book earlier, they seem to want you to pay with PayPal.  At this time, they accept paying when you show up.    There is no room shortage.  In fact, most of the rooms were not occupied during my stay.  The WIFI is cutting in and out even near the reception area.    You can see the church from the 2nd flo"

There is a taxi stand there.  a taxi charges 250 pesos to the airport."
"Coco Cabanas have much to recommend them. Foremost is the owner and staff. Steve, the owner, is excellent at what he does. He made us feel very welcome, even giving us fresh fruit from his garden.. If we needed a recommendation or a connection, he was right there with all sorts of suggestions. If we wanted to sit under our umbrella and read quietly, he disappeared. Eva, the manager of the property, was also a treasure. She had the best laugh and she made sure all went smoothly. The casita was very clean and"
"The Posada is super close to the Malecon & to the port where all the tours exit. There are stores & restaurants to eat around everything to walking distance. Loreto is a very nice & beautiful town.

All mornings they´ve water for coffee & the. There are few rooms (named as countries) so make sure to call to let the hostess know "
"This is a Baja style resort just N of the Loreto Malecon meaning it is a bit rough but has all the amenities you would expect(pools, restaurant, bar).  If you get lucky as we were, you might meet some Mexican Tele-Novella stars, since during our last stay they were filming at the resort. The Desert Inn has buildings that house up to around 24 rooms and several 4 plexes that house the accommodations we chose.  For around $60 US you get a pet friendly suite that include 2 kings, fireplace, entry, nice bath, a"

"This is a unique property. We had one of four cabanas which surround the pool, with a beautiful garden that is tended every day.The property is about half a block from the malecon, and walking distance to the marina as well as downtown.

"Right on the main street, secure parking (and a covered area for motorcycle parking), clean rooms, excellent Internet, and great price. Easy walk to the oceanfront and you are surrounded by good restaurants. You definitely want rooms away from the street - in high season, I imagine that the street is very loud with music and cars and voices, as this is very much a beach vacation town. You have to ask for hangers. We stayed here three nights on our way South in Baja and another night on our way back. They ma"
"We stayed at Coco Cabana (#4) for a week, and there are no complaints! It was the perfect place to stay, clean, quiet and relaxing! The cabana is bigger than it looks in the photos, with a king bed, kitchen, and bathroom- everything you need! It’s only a short easy walk to the beach, malecon and town, so really the perfect location! The staff and owner, Stephen are all wonderful and we will definitely be back!"
"My husband and I went to Loreto for almost 2 weeks and stayed at Casa Cabañas.  It was the perfect place for us- quiet and clean, air-conditioned, staff were super friendly, and just the relaxing place we had hoped for located in a safe and family-oriented neighborhood. We were close enough to walk everywhere we needed to go and were delighted to receive recommendations from Eva and Stephen on which captain to take for a trip to Isla Coronado and to offer guidance on everything from where to find the best f"

If you're a light sleeper this is a noisy location. They have internet but it was sketchy at best and the TV didn't work. The shower was hot and the towels were decent but the room was a bit grimy.

We have stayed in both the Casitas and the Cabanas and found each to fit our needs at different times.

"We came here for a meal on our last night in town. The hotel has a wonderful patio restaurant overlooking the beach, with cozy tables nestled under the giant fig tree in the courtyard, lit with twinkling lights and candles. Beautiful! The service was impeccable and the food delicious! We were offered a large basket of fresh, warm olive-studded focaccia and rolls with sweet balsamic and olive oil while we waited for our order.

"Visited here February 2014 for one night and I enjoyed it.  It was a quiet night and I slept well.  The owners are very nice and helpful.  They allowed me to keep one of my bags in their office and hang some of my clothes on their clothes line.  Nice little garden in the back.  They have free filtered water and coffee.  The hotel is a few blocks from the malecón where you can get a whale watch tour.  The rooms are fairly small and bathroom smaller, but I would stay here again for sure."
"I stayed at Martin and Maricruz's Posada San Martin all 5 nights that I was in Loreto last April and I thoroughly appreciated my stay. Martin and Maricruz were very helpful in answering all my questions and in making me feel at home.  The rooms are basic but are nice, comfortable, clean, well located and good value. Coffee was always ready when I got up, which is always greatly appreciated :) I can't wait to go back to Baja and to Loreto in particular! Thank you again to my great hosts.  Muchas gracias Mart"
This is a  small set of 4 Casistas located only 1 block from the ocean and 2 blocks from the square. Liz is very helpful and the place is wonderful. There is everything that you need for your stay there. It is very safe. Our plane got cancelled and we were 3 days late getting into Loreto. Liz was extremely helpful and made it work out nicely for us.  I would love to stay there again!
"I'd planned on visiting Las Cabanas several years ago. One thing or another got in the way. This year was it. Just got back from a solo adventure down the Baja peninsula. The highlight of my trip was my weeklong stay at Las Cabanas de Loreto. Down to earth luxury. Really helpful in putting me in contact with a local woman I was wanting to meet. The morning Panga outing with Rick was outstanding making memories to last a lifetime. The fully stocked outdoor kitchen/BBQ, the pool and hot tub, all clean and inv"
"My grown children and I had a chance to stay here, it was so relaxing.  Jill and Rick are so kind and helped us figure out things to do and get in touch with people.  I can't think of a better vacation for us, at this time, to be able to relax and have some privacy but also community as well.  Rick takes incredible nature photos and they are everywhere.  We were able to walk and use the bikes to go all over town and along the beach and had great experiences with the guide and restaurants and activities that"
" tasty and fresh. We had limonadas (fresh limeade) with sparkling water and I got a piña colada. The bill was $50 for the two of us, including the tip. The location can't be beat, and the food was fantastic. Wonderful evening, marred only very slightly by the live music, which was VERY LOUD and provided by a mediocre (at best) keyboard player."

"It is an average price-location hotel. Loreto it is a good lace to visit with a lot of diferent activities to develop, in land coastal and marine locations. The hotel is cheap with standard facilities. "
…
"Quiet, centrally located, clean, inexpensive. Friendly owners. Filtered water 24/7 and coffee in the morning in the central, roofed ""plaza."" Rooms are nothing fancy - not all have TVs or AC, all are dark, but plenty of hot water, clean rooms and towels daily, and GREAT prices. Wifi is dicey, but there are many places very close with free wifi, so just walk a block to a cafe with outdoor seating for wifi."
"The people at this hotel are the best! Daniel at the front desk was friendly and responsive to our needs. Bellmen Octavio during the morning/early afternoon and Benny during the afternoon/evening shifts were outstanding. In addition to taking care of us at the resort, they provided guidance for the surrounding neighborhood and Malecon and the their advice was on point!  Resort definitely could use some TLC but it wasn't a deal breaker. Rooms, pool and common areas were cleaned daily. Beach water was warm an"
"Super nice place to stay in Loreto. Comfortable beds, super clean everything, lots of fun and colorful details. Well equipped kitchenettes. Delightful and caring host. There is a shaded common area outside to have dinner or just hang out by the pool. Amazing location with parking.   We are certainly going back!"
"We are heading home tomorrow after a two week stay at El Tiburon. I’ve been reading through the glowing reviews and we are in total agreement.  1. Liz is a most amazing host, incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. CHECK 2. The casitas are exceedingly comfortable (excellent mattress); spacious; very clean; and perfectly located in the heart of Loreto. CHECK 3. Loreto itself is a terrific destination for northerners craving a little winter sunshine. It is clean, friendly, quiet, and always felt very safe. CHEC"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Not only do Jill and Rick provide a very comfortable accommodation, they will happily help you take advantage of all Loreto and the area has to offer. Scheduling trips, offering local suggestions and providing lots of extras such as bikes, games, books and a fabulous outdoor kitchen is all part of it.  Ricks photography adorns the rooms and Jill’s margarita .... well, it’s just very good. Great location too. 5 stars!"
"We booked 4 nights here based on the excellent reviews, and found that they are all true.  Jill and Rick are so friendly and helpful! The property itself is within walking distance to everything you need.  The outdoor area has an amazing kitchen, pool, hot tub, fire pit, pizza oven, bar and more. You can spend the day relaxing here or go do any of the land or water activities in the area. "
"For our wedding anniversary, we chose to stay for three nights at the Oasis in Loreto. We brought along our two poodles. Our room was spacious and clean. The cleaning staff was attentive and very friendly. Nestor at the front desk was fantastic, arranging for a beautiful floral bouquet for our room. The waiter Manuel made our two dinners there memorable with his charm, wit, and excellent service. It was such a great experience we plan to stay again in November along with my sister and her husband."
Our group has been coming to Loreto for many years. We usually stay at a hotel near the marina. This time we were only staying for 1 night on the way to another location. We decided to give this hotel a try. The stay was very nice. The price was especially good compared to the other hotel that we usually stay at. The rooms were very clean and the pool and all the areas are well maintained & clean. We tried the margarita offered by the bar next to the pool. They were excellent. The breakfast bar offered were
"We always have a wonderful time. The food, entertainment, waiters, Manny, Oscar, Marco& many more, hostesses, concierges five stars! We did miss Roberto! Hopefully we will see him next time! It’s not the same without him, always top notch service and Always with a smile!"
"From the moment we stepped through the door to the property, Jill was amazing, leading us to the outdoor bar and offering us a welcome Margarita.  Then at our request she booked a captain and ponga for us for the next morning. She then showed us the room where they have wetsuits, beach chairs, umbrellas, hats, snorkel gear etc. which we were welcome to borrow while there. We then rode beach cruisers (free to use by the guests) to town to eat at a restaurant she recommended. This is how our wonderful and rel"
"We have been making the drive up and down the Baja for over 10 years now!    Hotel Oasis has always been a safe, clean, friendly place we have counted on.  It is on the Beach ! We wake up to beautiful sunrises.  Every year they do a little bit better.  Had an amazing meal last night.  Best one yet and Manurl our server was Fantastic!"
"Good, full breakfasts included. This hotel is about 6-7 minutes walk from the center of the Malecon, and it is the only hotel located directly on the wide sand beach. The rooms are laid out motel style in a long line, separated by the bar and restaurant. Most are single story rooms, with perhaps a dozen  in two 2 story structures, all facing the beach. The restaurant has a large stone patio with tables for dining, and some lounging couches and chairs. Their are a few more upscale accommodations (see Le Miss"
"The Hacienda Suites were very good for Baja California.  The room was clean, had hot water, bottled water and wifi.  The breakfast was okay but served outside and it was rather cold (the air, not the food)."
It is close to Loreto - that is a positive.  A $21 cab fare each way.  The rate was $150 per person plus $25 for a golf cart - US dollars.  Utterly ridiculous!  We even challenged hin on the $25 cart fee and he looked at us like we had three heads.  Given the quality of the course - the price should have been about half of what we paid.  Will not be returning to this golf course.  The front nine holes are in the middle of a construction zone of villas and condos.  Hard to navigate the cart pathways - and so
 Their concierge services and recommendations made the trip stress free for me.  We will definately come back
"The Oasis Hotel isn’t nice. It’s just not a nice place. The room was hollow, sparse and “decorated” as an afterthought. It was not nice. The ""lock” on the room’s “door” was not in any way shape or form protective. Not nice and not secure. The area around the hotel was under construction, so not at all nice in spite of the property sitting against the sand of the beach. The restaurant’s breakfast was, wait for it... really nice!  Thus two instead on one star.  But what really wasn’t nice was the lie. We were"
"we booked a room for a couple of nights before we went to our resort . I was not expecting this place to be as cool as it was . staff was excellent , close enough to walk to beach or center . breakfast was fair and convenient  , Downfalls - no fridge in room . beds were below average but for the price a very good value"
" nine was much better, and in better repair.  We played the 18 holes,  but it was a moderate enjoyment overall, and an expensive one.  Spoke to people staying in a villa there and they said they bought 'coupons' or something of the sort, and when all was said and done, they were paying about $20 a round.  They also agreed the course was crappy, and encouraged us to try Danzante.  Now, for a bit further of a drive - or a $40 US cab each way - go to Dazante Golf course.  It is a 35 minute drive from the plaza"
" wild-goose-chase instructions for actionable contact. Here’s the rub; we don’t really want to go back there! It really was nasty. But now we’re into the whole principal of the thing game. The front desk is peopled by lovely young people who seem friendly and attentive (we even gave them cake), but who are capable of giving a customer the run around with the skill of BS all-stars like ATT&T. Maybe try somewhere else."
"Nice hotel with friendly staff and very affordable rates. We would definitely stay here again.   Traveled with family and the kids enjoyed the pool. We enjoyed the breakfast too, very simple but well arranged. "

"Dogs are 'welcome' with a cleaning fee and there are several yard dogs.  the collies are cool though.  Room is spacious.  Shower is good.  Shampoo and soaps provided.  Basic accommodation.  our room 4 was just outside the restaurant - which was not a noise issue, actually very pleasant  waitress at dinner was super friendly and fun.  fast service.  great hot cocoa with cinnamon on a cold evening.  yum only CON would be the lack of electrical outlets.  when we get off the road for the day we need to recharge"
This is not a resort. It is a very acceptable option for a traveler on a budget. The staff was friendly and spoke enough English that we could communicate when we needed. The room was clean and everything functioned without fault. It is surrounded by a 5 foot wall so it is physically separate from the neighborhood but not at all separated from the sounds of the neighborhood. If barking dogs and crowing roosters bother you perhaps you should book one of the resorts. My solution was ear plugs. I never have an
"Feces all over the outside of our toilet upon checkin. Very dirty sheets with stains and cigarette sized burn holes. We stay at hotels 300+ nights a year & this was one of the worst. The staff seemed nice, but overall cleanliness of the property is very questionable"
" way to soupy for me. Also toast, cereal, fruit etc. There is a restaurant and a market right next door. Anything else is an inexpensive cab ride away."
"Lovely ocean view room; great bed; daily maid service; all staff very nice and helpful.  Food is typical and tasty. Walking distance to Nopolo, where there are several good restaurants.  Wide private beach with watersport rentals."

"I have been staying here since it opened. The last time through Loreto I tried the Santa Fe to see what it was like and ended up with Bed Bug bites all over my legs. This time I came back to my go-to-hotel in Loreto, The Hacienda Suites. The staff is excellent and so are the rates. This is a very clean hotel right on the main street into town on the right right after the Santa Fe hotel.   They include a breakfast with the room and it is good. There is a pool and a bar. The restaurant is only open for breakf"
"Was expecting a nice, clean resort. But oh surprise is the complete opposite. We checked in at 9:30pm there was no bell boy available. When they gave us our room it was so dirty. There is mold in the walls, fan in the washrooms is disgusting, you can feel dirt in the floor, entrance light is not working,AC is broken, WC is not clean, clock is not working.  Definetly I am thinking it would've been a better option to go to villa group."
"This is a hotel were we come back each year we drive baja....THe hotel is great and location exceptional....The food service  still was bad but on the previous  the day we check out a NEW MANAGER started working and he wants to correct the problem and bring back the glory to this beautiful Hotel, hope he can do it because in this way we will have a great place to stay and eat as well.Also Eligio Benitez on the hotel direct reservation was really nice"
"Beautiful location and reasonable value for money for the room which had a lovely sea view.  But the fixtures, fittings and linen were all due a refresh, while the buffet breakfast was missable.  Getting a wristband on arrival was a bit naff, though I suppose had we wanted drinks while in the pool or on the beach they would have been useful.  We were comfortable and felt safe.  The outings agency offers good tours.  It’s a 15 minute drive to Loreto.  Golf course looks passable."
"Fantastic boutique hotel on the main square.  We stayed in one of the four suites which had a comfortable bed , great shower and a/c. Breakfast was served by the pool - fruit, toast, eggs, tortillas juice and coffee - included in room rate. The pool is nice and has a covered shady area .  Wonderful find"
"I stayed in Room #8 which is along the street side near the El Zopilote Brewing & Kitchen which is actually part of the property.  Very affordable room that had everything you need, was very quaint and came with free breakfast in the morning.  There is also a very nice small pool (which I did not use) located within the walls of the compound of this property.  The room had a nice shower and air conditioning that worked well as well as Internet connecting through the bar/restaurant.  You are literally only a"
 alone footsteps - from this lodging.  The owner was very pleasant upon check-in even though I did not have an advance reservation.  Do also eat & drink at their facility El Zopilote Brewing & Kitchen as it was very good beer and good food at reasonable prices with friendly service from the wait staff.  I would definitely return to Hotel 1697 the next time I'm in Loreto.
…
"Lovely little hotel with spacious, clean rooms, perfect pool for relaxing after activities and well shielded from the square for a peaceful stay while still being in the center of the action and walking distance to literally everything. Could not have been more pleased with our choice. Great little restaurant and microbrewery attached that looks out onto the main square. Great value. Staff wonderful."
"Great spot, close to every thing, right in the  heart of the main square. Part of the local craft beer brewery. Pool, a/c, parking if you have a car, good host who welcomes you and make you stay is awesome. Clean and quiet"
"The location is marvelous. The hotel has wonderful rooms, secluded and quiet.the beds are comfortable. The service is impeccable. You get a welcome drink on arrival at their restaurant plus 10% off all orders. Parking is street only."
"This hotel is beyond perfect! Heard great things about Loreto so we had to go visit. Did a little research and Hotel 1697 was on our radar. Since we fly standby, we did not have a reservation, just in case we didn’t make it on the flight. Arrived at the airport and had our driver take us to Hotel 1697. We were greeted by the friendly staff upon arrival. We needed 2 nights, but at the moment they could only guarantee one night. Luckily, they came back and said 2 nights were available. Awesome! Between the co"
" everything! Also, this place is located in the city center, which I noticed is patrolled by the friendly local police. Safety is not an issue at all. We felt very welcomed by everyone we encountered. Can’t wait to go back! Hotel 1697 is definitely our “go to” hotel. Budget friendly and even friendlier staff. Thanks for having us! ¡Hasta luego!"
"Very clean rooms, nice reception, open and airy rooms with a great fan and mini split system. The coffee system in the room does the job. Drinking water is easily available outside the rooms. Very secure and well located across from the gas station. Well worth the price"
…
"Pros: secure parking, friendly staff, nice spacious rooms, pet friendly, very clean.  Drawbacks: no tissues, no hairdryer, no microwave, no fridge, no extra TP, no iron,  And at this time, no breakfast.  There is a beautiful pedestrian-only historic district in Loreto with a mission, historic capital, and many nice shops and restaurants.  But it is a long walk from this hotel.  There are numerous nice hotels very near the plaza with only slightly higher prices."
"Came upon Hotel Angra as a fluke, as a member of my traveling party had booked a different hotel that was an absolute, stinking pit.  Thank heavens we were able to leave quickly (although not soon enough to suit me).  The Angra proprietor was kind enough to let the four of us put our luggage in an available room...and this was even though it was only ten in the morning, way before check-in.  The rooms were large, clean and blissfully quiet as we had been treated to a pack of howling/barking dogs pretty much"
" directions function, so glad I was able to buttonhole someone on the street who knew where it was and could point thataway:)  This evidently has been an ongoing issue with the hotel, but it is definitely worth persevering. Can't comment on the breakfast, as we didn't avail ourselves of that.  Can't imagine it anything other than excellent, in keeping with everything else."
…
"What a find! Clean, spacious, reasonably priced and very, very secure. (Locked iron gate!)  The proprietor is wonderful, the rooms are big and the sheets are clean. What more could you ask for?  Pet friendly! "
"Spent a night here while boosting the area. The room was nice. Very large, and would have benefited from an armchair. Convenient parking. Easy to walk places. The breakfast was very basic: two cereals and bread with butter or jelly, plus coffee. Nice staff. Small fountain outside near the office."
"Excellent small hotel. Clean. Sparsely furnished, but everything you need. Secure. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Our second visit to here. Would recommend this as a place to stay. Will return in the future. "
"Without question one of the best (budget) hotels that I have so far stayed at in Baja California. Terri and Anna made my stay truly enjoyable, along with their lovely staff. The whole place is kept pristine. The rooms are lovely, and big, and the beds large and super comfy. The location is also very good - approx 10 to 15 mins walk from the historic centre. In addition it is very near the bus terminal. Perfect if you don’t have a car. The buffet breakfast - coffee, cereal, and bread/toast, is a lovely touch"
We came for 1 night on our way to our new house in Cabo but ended up staying 5 nights because the owners and staff were so nice and helpful.  Loreto is a lovely town to walk around and sample many good restaurants and soak up the relaxed atmosphere.  The room at The Angra was very clean and spacious.  If it had a refrigerator it would be perfect.  A precious time for us.
Attractive but peculiar place. We checked in yesterday afternoon and we’re shown around by a pleasant young guy named Leo. This is the only staff person we have seen since. A place of the size that is clean must have people working on it constantly but we haven’t seen anyone. There’s a coffee pot here and I made my own coffee he seem to filtered water that’s available. But no milk or creamer and no one to ask about them. My room was smallish but everything worked and my bed was comfortable. I was in room fi
" here. There’s a large public patio with an aviary that’s pleasant to sit in. And there is an effort made to make it attractive with artwork and so forth. If you like birds you will love the aviary with many parrots. My room was dark. The price was excellent, at least $20 less than other places and there’s a kitchen where you can cook which is useful. Everything is clean. I probably would have more positive vibes if I saw even one employee and if there was creamer for my coffee."
"WiFi advertised by hotel does not work anywhere.  Other guests me WiFi did not work for them either.  Hotel advertised for available.  Not true.  I had to take my clothes to the laundry twice.  I had food poisoning while in Loreto.  I got two towels and two sheets dirty.  Also, some my own shorts dirty.  My shorts cleaned fine, but owner demanded that I pay $100 US.  I have stayed in hotels all over the world without any problems.  I usually do not write bad reviews.  The owners of El Moro are the worst.  Y"
"The hotel itself is charming, as well as expensive.  If you are unfortunate to have a room on the third floor, it is 38 steps down and then 38 stops back up to your room.  (Beware - no elevator in the hotel.) We specifically asked not to have a room overlooking the plaza - but had corner room (#360 called Bougainvillaea Room) with two large corner windows over the plaza.  Very noisy.  Loud music all day long from across the street at a museum or something, or elsewhere in the plaza.  It is not the hotel its"

"We stayed here one night on the way to Cabo, and stayed another night on the way back to San Diego. Awesome room, it was big, clean, quiet. A small outdoor patio area where we cooked dinner and breakfast. We had our own camping gear. Air conditioning works great. Owner was pleasant."
" look into it.  48 hours later - nothing.  I did my 76 steps to walk down and ask again - she replied that the manager would be in the following morning and I could come back and talk to him then.  Had also shared with her that there was no hot water in our room.  One would think the manager might have come up to our room to speak with us, but no, next morning, I did the 76 step ordeal again.  The manager said he would reboot the internet - it helped marginally for a short time.  We actually have to come do"
"El hotel es pequeño pero muy cómodo está fuera del centro como a 15 minutos caminando, tiene agua caliente, tv de cable, aire acondicionado, estacionamiento, el personal es muy amable, está bien para continuar tu camino y conocer el pueblo mágico de Loreto."
"Quiet neighborhood, midway between the malecon and city center, friendly and economical. It seems to be a favorite base for fishermen. It's off the main streets in a residential area with many fishermen in the neighborhood to provide advice."
"I stayed here from 4/10/14 through 4/16/14.  I was a little leery at first, as the term ""RV Park"" had negative connotations in my mind.  I was in Loreto to go fishing with some friends, and the other place I had stayed at before, had no vacancy.    Claudia, the owner's daughter, was very friendly and accommodating.  We were given the rate of 350 pesos/night (~$29/night) even though it was high season.  The regular price was supposed to be 400 pesos/night (~$33/night).      The rooms are clean, odor free, ha"

"The hotel is a cute ""boutique"" hotel right on the Loreto town square.  It is a nice location, with many nice restaurants within a 5 minute walk, and just a few blocks to the Sea of Cortez.  We had a Junior Suite, which was spacious, but fairly starkly appointed.  It had windows that opened on the square, which could get very noisy at times (there are musicians on the square throughout the day and in the evening.  Our main complaint, which led to 3 stars instead of 4 is that it was quite cold in the room and"

The room was incredible, the staff very helpful and the location excellent. The spacious room was very quiet and comfortable.  It was the type of room you enjoy just being in!"
"This place is absolutely Gorgeous and the room is charming beyond belief!! However a few things need attention. It’s fun to have an actual room key but the big wood key ring is cumbersome. There is no safe in the room. The Wi-Fi is terrible and the tv, while new could not get any reception. The phone in the room also didn’t work. The roof deck and pool are lovely but the pool is older. They only have continental breakfast and no bar or restaurant. That was missed for sure as we would have spent more money t"

Great location. Beautiful hotel. Clean. Quaint. We loved the feel of it. And they were very nice to help us park a long trailer in a gated and secure lot. I would definitely stay there again. Nice courtyard and awesome rooftop balcony too. Our room had a private balcony as well. Loved it.
"I stayed at the Posada del Cortes in November 2021 before and after a kayak trip. It's a beautiful place in a great location, close to the main square in Loreto. The staff was very pleasant and helpful and went out of their way to help me with phone calls and arrangements. I would definitely stay there again - Loreto is well worth a visit.  One tip - if you want the continental breakfast, you might verify with the person at the desk at night to make sure they have your request. There's a very good place for"

Was such a sweet stay right in heart of Loreto.   Wonderful service and super comfortable beds.   Fresh baked pastries delivered to our room and sweet rooftop patio.  We will stay again!! Thank You!  Stop at Mike’s Bar around the corner for a drink or take a massage at the spa in the square.  Quiet and beautiful hotel.  They are expanding with more rooms and a pool.. New favorite hotel in town. 
"We were pleasantly surprised with our stay at Posada del Cortes Hotel. It was conveniently located to the Old Historic District, restaurants and the water.  We  would stay there again if we return to a Loreto."
"We stayed at Posada del Cortes several nights in January & February 2020; the hotel room was very comfortable, clean, and elegant. The staff were wonderful and even called to tell us we had left something behind. Very beautiful. "
"I spent 3 nights at Posada del Cortes. I found it to be charming, quiet and with real old time local character although impeccably well kept and up to date and clean. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Excellent choice. Located very close to the historic downtown, waterfront and many good restaurants. "
"This review of Posada del Cortes is intended to make a traveler informed and make sure expectations are in line with reality. First the good, and there are plenty. The property is charming, well maintained and appointed on a relatively quiet street a few blocks from the Malecón and short walking distance from nearly everything. The rooms are clean and well appointed. There is Cable in each room with 150 channels and, not surprisingly, all Spanish except for CNN. 2 bottles of fresh water is left in the room "
 space. The linens were more exfoliating tools than towels and the hot water was absent twice during a 4 day stay. The shower does not drain so you stand in 3” of water during a short shower. The room we were in on the first level in front had no ventilation at all. That made running a noisy air conditioner at night a must. The overhead light was apparently not grounded as it flickered all night creating a less than restful feeling. The staff is very nice and will help with typical Mexican hospitality. Some

"A great place, but when you need to connect to the world, family, friends etc the wifi is the absolute worst I’ve ever experienced from a hotel in my life, a tweet can sometimes take 10 mins to load, and I’ve waited 40 mins to upload a simple 40 second video to Instagram. If the owners of the place paid a little more for some fast wifi (which is available as the local marina has it) this place would be 5/5 for me. Do it! “High speed internet my A”…"

The hotel itself in a tranquil heaven, and days spent by the pool are gorgeous and deeply relaxing.

The proximity to the small but international airport makes it even easier to fly in and based your Baja adventures from here!  The hotel is perfect as a romantic getaway for two, small groups, and even large families! Do yourself a favor and book your next stay here. It's a true gem."

"This property was stunning. Peaceful views of mountains, gardens, and sounds of birds chirping. Property dogs and cats are so sweet. Restaurant was good and margaritas were perfect after a long day of driving. The staff were very friendly and they have a security guard over night patrolling the parking. The room is spacious but outdated. The bed is comfortable, but definitely on the harder side. Bathroom could use major upgrades.

"We have enjoyed the restaurant here in the past. This is our first time staying in the hotel.   Amazing staff and very clean rooms, but we were required to sign a full page of rules for our dog to stay with us. Violation of one or more of the rules would result in canceled reservation with no refund on the room.  "
"I've been to the Tripui hotel many times, this was probably my third this year. I always enjoy being in such a tranquil site, which is surrounded by big mountains, canyons  and a unique bay. The food is also amazing!"
"We have been staying at Hotel Tripui two or three times a year for over twenty years.  The hotel experience has always been good and has been a good value for the price.  The restaurant has been very good for at least the last five years.  The pool area and landscaping is simply beautiful.  We have always had pets and the pet fees have always been reasonable.  This year, not so.  They almost bordered on the ridiculous.  The pet fee was 500 Mxn per pet of which we have two.  The room fee was $1,100 Mxn and t"
 The A/C can not keep the room comfortable.  All other rooms are okay as is Rm 108 if your stay is not in the summer months.
"This is our second stay at a Villa del Palmar property.  The staff was excellent. They were super friendly and very attentive.  Josue waited on at the pool. He was great. Always in a good mood. The food was very good as well. We ate at the buffet, Mia Casa and Danzante. All very good. The beach party/BBQ was very fun.    The views are spectacular. Probably the best I've ever had in Mexico. It was quiet and relaxing."
Just got back on the May 21st after staying for a week.  This was our second trip to the resort.  The other was last September.  It was nice to see the room expansion completed.  Our room was a studio on the six floor above the lobby.  Incredible view out to the bay.  Played golf twice.  Course is special.  Beautiful views everywhere.  Greens and fairways in perfect playing condition.  17th hole is incredible.  I won't try to describe just look at the attached picture.  The best way to go is all inclusive. 
" takes great care of you with both serving and making drinks.  You can walk out into the water forever and it only goes up to your waist.  Breakfast was always at the Market.  Buffet style.  We always sat in the section being served by Jesus, Jose Luis, and Cristian.  They were wonderful servers every day.  We enjoyed Oscar as our server at the pool.  One of the best I've ever had.  We ate dinner at the Market, Casa Club, and Casa Mia.  The Casa Club is at the golf course.  Slightly up the hill with beautif"

"If you want the best vacation experience, this is the place to go! Manny gave us top notch service pool side, Brenda always takes great care of us at the spa, Martha gives an amazing massage and Gloria is the best concierge we have ever had.  There is something for everyone."
"Danzante Bay is a magical getaway. Tucked into the mountains near Loreto, this resort boasts a private beach, incredible golf, stupendous pools, and amenities galore. The staff is so friendly and go out of their way to make your experience very special. One person in particular, Lupita, really made us feel like family each morning at the breakfast buffet. The food is very well prepared and each kitchen takes pride in delivering the most quality dishes with incredible local flavors. Let them know any special"
" a la carte bills can rack up quite quickly. Bring your clubs or rent, the rentals are pretty good quality. We chose to bring our own, they can store them for you up at the club house.   PS: Special thanks to Lupita, she is now a part of the family."

"I felt so privileged staying here.  The service was impeccable.  The staff were so polite and helpful.  The grounds were lovely.  The beach was gorgeous with many comfortable lounge chairs and beach umbrellas.  Loved the drink and food service on the beach plus snorkels, paddle boards and kayaks.  There was a well maintained walking path to secluded coves with good water visibility for snorkeling.  On the path there was even a small cave with petroglyphs. I highly recommend getting the all inclusive package"
"What makes this place an excellent experience are the people who work there, who go out of their way to make your stay an absolute pleasure. There are many activities, excursions, and adventures for all ages every day, as well as shows with incredible, engaging performers - who are also genuinely nice people. Gregorio did a great job making sure we had everything we needed at our meals; Laura & Ximena went above & beyond helping both adults and little ones enjoy activities; everyone working there was profes"
"Very enjoyable stay! Clean and comfortable accomodation, and the staff are very friendly, especially Samantha in the restaurant Casa Mia who took very good care of us. We will be back to Loreto and for sure back to The Santa Fe Hotel."
Most of the reviews are for the restaurant Wich we went and I must say the margarita pizza was excellent.. looks more like a cafeteria to me anyway.  On the room: air conditioning not working asked front desk 3 times never came had to sleep with window open very noisy all night difficult to sleep with the noise. You can hear the house phone when it ring from adjacent room very thin wall. The bed ah the bed be aware it is a twin bed and it is so soft or old that you sink in the middle. Last think the switch

El desayuno, pizza de mariscos y las cenas son excelentes.  Gracias por su hospitalidad y su comida excelente. Recomiendo este restaurante al 100%"
"Dinner at the Italian restaurant Casa Mia located at the Hotel Santa Fe was delicious. We both had the lasagna with Caesar salads. The rosemary sourdough bread was excellent as was the service provided by our waiter, Joel.  Definitely will return.  Luckily we live here and can keep going back for more great Italian food."
Food in restaurant was great. Hotel was good. Needs a bit of an update.  People were very nice and helpful.  Our maid Soledad Davis was so sweet and worked so hard. Was great having a convenience store attached to the hotel.
"The ideal place for a warm visit of Loreto. Food and attention is remarkable! Definitely a place you want to come and stay. Joel is the best waiter! It is so centric and calm, I wish I was acompanied by my pet!"
